        <title>Spending a lot more time on Bluesky from now on. Handle is @maggieappleton.com

Might still x-post occasionally, but most of the people I enjoy interacting with have moved over, which is all I needed. Come join us!</title>

        <title>R to @Mappletons: Losing a hyper-social place to put crappy, half-baked sketches and ideas, and get real reactions to them, is one of the larger losses at stake.

Idea-development space requires more than a Twitter-shaped platform. Also needs a lively culture of generous replies, yes-and-ing, and good shitposting. Waiting for that culture to develop elsewhere...</title>

        <title>R to @Mappletons: RSS isn&apos;t dead. Following single sites still works. But community distribution and curation feel like the missing pieces here.

Hard not to blame it all on the downfall of the Twitter algorithm. I&apos;m trying to post on Bluesky more (http://bsky.app/profile/maggieappleton.com), but it&apos;s still quiet and lacks the raw mass of people here.</title>

        <title>R to @Mappletons: We&apos;re in a weird limbo shift without the right cultural infrastructure to encourage, support, distribute, and curate good quality personal writing and research.

If people are writing thoughtful, quality things on personal sites or gardens, I don&apos;t know how we&apos;d ever find them.</title>

        <title>Ta-Nehisi Coates has the same energy of all my favourite professors from university; bold claims, spades of integrity, high standards.

        <title>Consistently baffled by The Discourse on falling fertility rates and endless speculation (primarily by men) on all possible causes of it.

Certainly a many-causes-situation. But I&apos;ve grown up surrounded by community and family stories of pre ~1980&apos;s women unable to access birth control, made to have children they didn&apos;t want, made to marry and become housewives &amp; mothers despite wanting something else.

Seems fairly clear the main driver is there are fewer unwanted babies born to women who have the right to choice and agency over their own lives now. Net positive, as far as I can tell.</title>

        <title>All good things must come to an end, but still sad.
Started reading Ribbonfarm in high school (~2008)! Had no a clue what half of it was saying.
Exposed me to a kind a chaotic, intellectually-intense writing style I didn’t know you were allowed to do.
Leaving a hole in the blogosphere few others can fill…</title>

We need snarky British mode. When we getting David Attenborough chatting to Maggie Smith as the default?</title>
