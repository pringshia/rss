        <title>All good things must come to an end, but still sad.
Started reading Ribbonfarm in high school (~2008)! Had no a clue what half of it was saying.
Exposed me to a kind a chaotic, intellectually-intense writing style I didn‚Äôt know you were allowed to do.
Leaving a hole in the blogosphere few others can fill‚Ä¶</title>

        <title>NotebookLM&apos;s generated podcast is pretty good! But the generically American, over-scripted voices are grating to listen to. It&apos;s NPR-ish acting/phrasing is cringe.

We need snarky British mode. When we getting David Attenborough chatting to Maggie Smith as the default?</title>

Apple has somehow conditioned me to walk around London semi-deaf as a normal state of affairs...</title>

        <title>R to @Mappletons: Feels like something we could expose more people to (without the painful infection bit).

In school we had days where we wore a blindfold to understand how blind people navigate and cope. And 48 hour fasts to understand what extreme hunger feels like. Hearing loss would be easy to mimic in the same way.</title>

        <title>Been partially deaf this week thanks to severe ear infection in both ears. Awful, painful, but useful experience.

YouTube or Twitter video doesn‚Äôt have accurate captions? No idea what‚Äôs going on. Can‚Äôt watch it.

Can‚Äôt do zoom calls. Would need live subtitles.

Can‚Äôt use background noise (footsteps, cars, voices) to figure out what or who is happening around me.

Stranger says something to me in a shop. Haven‚Äôt a clue. Politely smile and hope that suffices.

Fascinating and helpful to lose a sense for a while.</title>
