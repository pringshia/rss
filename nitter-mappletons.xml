        <title>R to @Mappletons: Seems like we&apos;re making some progress by reframing &quot;macro software&quot; as general purpose &quot;shortcut&quot; software a la @raycastapp. Nicer interface, slicker interactions.

But we&apos;re still missing accessible interfaces to the scripting bit. E.g. Raycast requires writing JavaScript</title>

        <title>R to @Mappletons: Generally confused about the state of macro software. 
Current tools feel clunky and outdated relative to their high usefulness.

I&apos;m biased as a heavy macro user, but surprised how few people have fat libraries of personal macro scripts.</title>

        <title>Bullish on macros. Where are all the language-models-meet-macros startups?

Waiting for someone to make a better Keyboard Maestro with natural language input and vision. Automate 1000 tiny tasks for me.

I assume this is what @AdeptAILabs are cooking. But TBD.</title>

        <title>RT by @Mappletons: 💭 Synthesizer for thought:
http://thesephist.com/posts/synth/

What kind of weird interfaces may be worth thinking about in a world where we can interact with ideas as mathematical objects?

We might find an interesting analogy in synthesizers, a tool to create and interact with sound as mathematical objects that has opened up new genres and practices in music.

A synthesizer produces music very differently than an acoustic instrument. It produces music at the lowest level of abstraction, as mathematical models of sound waves. It’s a way of producing sound by assembling it from logical components rather than creating it wholesale by hitting or vibrating something natural.

The synthesizer is just one example of a pattern in the history of media: with breakthroughs in mathematical understanding of a medium, come new tools that exploit that mathematical understanding to enable new creative forms and human interfaces.

What could that look like for writing and thinking?</title>

        <title>More nonsense from me railing against chatbots. Just another Tuesday.

Caveat: sure, we can have *some* useful, open-ended chat-ish interfaces.
But most complex, interesting, genuinely important human tasks do not take the shape of asking text boxes to fuzzy search the web</title>

        <title>Had a delightful chat with @jlengstorf a few weeks ago about my chaotic, unplanned career “strategy”

Talked about liberally switching directions, learning a broad range of skills, and not setting goals beyond 6 months.

Works for me, but YMMV 😎</title>

        <title>2,900km / 0km

Finally had to retire my lovely orange Merrell Trail Glove running shoes.

Swapping them out for a pair of Xero HFS II. Super bright. Super comfy.

(Yes I know you’re not “supposed” to put that many kilometres on a single pair. But my rule is no holes, no problems)</title>
