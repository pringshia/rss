We covered a whole range of language-model-related topics: short and long term design &amp; eng implications, multi-modal models, the design engineering debate, proactive models and agents, and a touch of digital gardening at the end.</title>

        <title>More nonsense from me railing against chatbots. Just another Tuesday.

Caveat: sure, we can have *some* useful, open-ended chat-ish interfaces.
But most complex, interesting, genuinely important human tasks do not take the shape of asking text boxes to fuzzy search the web</title>

Talked about liberally switching directions, learning a broad range of skills, and not setting goals beyond 6 months.

Works for me, but YMMV üòé</title>

        <title>2,900km / 0km

Finally had to retire my lovely orange Merrell Trail Glove running shoes.

Swapping them out for a pair of Xero HFS II. Super bright. Super comfy.

(Yes I know you‚Äôre not ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to put that many kilometres on a single pair. But my rule is no holes, no problems)</title>

        <title>R to @Mappletons: Small, specific conferences with &lt;150 people united by a philosophy, rather than a specific technology, are magical. Especially when you&apos;re united by trying to bring something into being.

Drastically different vibes from 300+ person confs focused on X language, tool, or library</title>

        <title>R to @Mappletons: I assumed a lot of knowledge about local-first philosophy given the audience.

If you need to catch-up, here&apos;s the canonical essay on it: https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/

Before coming into this conf I only had an amateur understanding of the movement, but I&apos;m pretty much pilled now.</title>

Did a new talk on why language models making software development faster, easier, and cheaper will create a golden age of home-cooked software &amp; barefoot developers.

        <title>In the pain and suffering stage of pulling a complex argument together into a coherent structure.

But noticing I‚Äôm better at tolerating it. Or at least I‚Äôve done enough reps that I‚Äôm able to watch part of me start to panic, and can reassure myself I don‚Äôt need to.

Instead I can calmly throw out my existing material and try to reconstruct the argument again from the ground up.

Growth, or something.</title>
