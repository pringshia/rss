        <title>Who do I know in London building original AI products?

Apart from @meetgranola, @NustomSoftware, @tldraw, @humanloop

As in, the company is founded and based in London. Feels like this list should be longer.</title>

        <title>*Loved* talking to @schickling about barefoot developers and local-first software.
I only became interested in local-first this year, but was quickly convinced this is how we should build software. 
So many important connections between enabling local data and enabling local software cultures.</title>

        <title>My one weird gripe with everyone using Substack is every newsletter looks the same.
It&apos;s like everyone showing up with the same face or speaking in the same monotone voice. I can&apos;t tell them apart. I forget whose words I&apos;m reading.
Sure, I care more about visual design, distinction, and character than others. But it honestly affects my ability to read and remember the material.</title>

        <title>Started my new role as a lead design engineer at Normally @normallystudio this week üéâ

They&apos;re a small London studio focused on mindful, applied AI. Lots of internal R&amp;D. The whole team is some kind of hybrid, so I fit right in. Excited to build here.

        <title>Some bittersweet news. I&apos;ve moved on from Elicit.

I still love the team and product, and hope they do fantastically.

But living a split life in between London and San Francisco wasn&apos;t working for me. Solo, remote designer is a tough job.
