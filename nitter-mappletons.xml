        <title>R to @Mappletons: I&apos;m still actively looking for sponsors for this edition.
If you work for a company that wants to present to a willing audience of creative developers (mix of web, backend, ML) – get in touch!
Costs £400-500 and you get a 15-20min demo slot to say anything you like.</title>

        <title>R to @Mappletons: Losing a hyper-social place to put crappy, half-baked sketches and ideas, and get real reactions to them, is one of the larger losses at stake.

Idea-development space requires more than a Twitter-shaped platform. Also needs a lively culture of generous replies, yes-and-ing, and good shitposting. Waiting for that culture to develop elsewhere...</title>

        <title>R to @Mappletons: RSS isn&apos;t dead. Following single sites still works. But community distribution and curation feel like the missing pieces here.

Hard not to blame it all on the downfall of the Twitter algorithm. I&apos;m trying to post on Bluesky more (http://bsky.app/profile/maggieappleton.com), but it&apos;s still quiet and lacks the raw mass of people here.</title>

        <title>Consistently baffled by The Discourse on falling fertility rates and endless speculation (primarily by men) on all possible causes of it.

Certainly a many-causes-situation. But I&apos;ve grown up surrounded by community and family stories of pre ~1980&apos;s women unable to access birth control, made to have children they didn&apos;t want, made to marry and become housewives &amp; mothers despite wanting something else.

Seems fairly clear the main driver is there are fewer unwanted babies born to women who have the right to choice and agency over their own lives now. Net positive, as far as I can tell.</title>
