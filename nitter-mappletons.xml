        <title>My one weird gripe with everyone using Substack is every newsletter looks the same.
It&apos;s like everyone showing up with the same face or speaking in the same monotone voice. I can&apos;t tell them apart. I forget whose words I&apos;m reading.
Sure, I care more about visual design, distinction, and character than others. But it honestly affects my ability to read and remember the material.</title>

        <title>Started my new role as a lead design engineer at Normally @normallystudio this week üéâ

They&apos;re a small London studio focused on mindful, applied AI. Lots of internal R&amp;D. The whole team is some kind of hybrid, so I fit right in. Excited to build here.

        <title>Some bittersweet news. I&apos;ve moved on from Elicit.

I still love the team and product, and hope they do fantastically.

But living a split life in between London and San Francisco wasn&apos;t working for me. Solo, remote designer is a tough job.

        <title>RT by @Mappletons: üí≠ Synthesizer for thought:
http://thesephist.com/posts/synth/

What kind of weird interfaces may be worth thinking about in a world where we can interact with ideas as mathematical objects?

We might find an interesting analogy in synthesizers, a tool to create and interact with sound as mathematical objects that has opened up new genres and practices in music.

A synthesizer produces music very differently than an acoustic instrument. It produces music at the lowest level of abstraction, as mathematical models of sound waves. It‚Äôs a way of producing sound by assembling it from logical components rather than creating it wholesale by hitting or vibrating something natural.

The synthesizer is just one example of a pattern in the history of media: with breakthroughs in mathematical understanding of a medium, come new tools that exploit that mathematical understanding to enable new creative forms and human interfaces.

What could that look like for writing and thinking?</title>
