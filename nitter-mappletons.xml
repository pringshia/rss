        <title>R to @Mappletons: Will say more about where I&apos;m moving later!
Joining a team based here in London üá¨üáß
Still working in AI prototyping and interface design, but moving to a place where I hopefully have more designers around for support and mentorship. And can do more research / exploratory work.</title>

        <title>Some bittersweet news. I&apos;ve moved on from Elicit.

I still love the team and product, and hope they do fantastically.

But living a split life in between London and San Francisco wasn&apos;t working for me. Solo, remote designer is a tough job.

        <title>RT by @Mappletons: üí≠ Synthesizer for thought:
http://thesephist.com/posts/synth/

What kind of weird interfaces may be worth thinking about in a world where we can interact with ideas as mathematical objects?

We might find an interesting analogy in synthesizers, a tool to create and interact with sound as mathematical objects that has opened up new genres and practices in music.

A synthesizer produces music very differently than an acoustic instrument. It produces music at the lowest level of abstraction, as mathematical models of sound waves. It‚Äôs a way of producing sound by assembling it from logical components rather than creating it wholesale by hitting or vibrating something natural.

The synthesizer is just one example of a pattern in the history of media: with breakthroughs in mathematical understanding of a medium, come new tools that exploit that mathematical understanding to enable new creative forms and human interfaces.

What could that look like for writing and thinking?</title>
