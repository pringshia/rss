		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced a new firmware update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, including both the Lightning model and the new USB-C model. The new firmware is version 6B32, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/apple-releases-airpods-pro-2-firmware-update/">6A305 firmware</a> introduced in October.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new in the update, but prior software releases have been refining functionality introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; added several new features for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2, such as Adaptive Audio. Adaptive Audio, which combines ANC and Transparency, is meant to deliver an ideal audio experience that blocks out loud or distracting noises.<br/>
<br/>
Adaptive Audio includes Conversation Awareness and Personalized Volume. Conversation Awareness detects when someone speaks to you, lowering the volume of what's playing and cutting down on background noise so you can hear. Personalized Volume takes into account your listening preferences and the noise in the environment to adjust sound levels.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include an option to mute and unmute the microphone by pressing on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; stem, faster automatic switching between devices, and support for activating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> without including the "Hey" wake word.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ or ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 17.2, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-beta-2-to-developers/">currently in beta</a> and is expected to be released in December, Apple's opt-in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-enable-sensitive-content-warnings/">Sensitive Content Warning feature</a> will work with Contact Posters in both the Contacts and Phone apps, as well as stickers in the Messages app.<br/>

When turned on, the Sensitive Content Warning feature uses on-device machine learning to analyze photos and videos, and blurs photos or videos with any detected nudity before users view them. Apple says it does not receive any indication that nudity was detected, and does not gain access to the photos or videos as a result.<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-enable-sensitive-content-warnings/">iOS 17: How to Enable Sensitive Content Warnings</a></li></ul>Sensitive Content Warnings are also available for messages in the Messages app, AirDrop transfers, and FaceTime video messages. The feature launched earlier this year across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch.

		<description><![CDATA[The second beta of iOS 17.2 adds a new feature that allows an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max to record Spatial Video that can be viewed in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app on Apple's forthcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-apple-visioin-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911687" /><br/>
Spatial Video recording can be enabled by going to the Settings app, tapping into the Camera section, selecting Formats, and toggling on "Spatial Video for &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">iOS 17.2 Beta 2 enables Spatial Video recording <a href="https://t.co/mLMbI8aG6d">pic.twitter.com/mLMbI8aG6d</a></p>&mdash; iSoftware Updates (@iSWUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1722684032796733923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple says that for best results when recording Spatial Video, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> should be held stable in landscape orientation while capturing video. Video is recorded at 30 frames per second at 1080p, and one minute of video takes up 130MB of storage space.<br/>
<br/>
Spatial Videos taken with an &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; can be viewed on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as well, but the video appears to be a normal video and not a Spatial Video. Spatial Videos feature a "Spatial" label to denote that they can be viewed in 3D on the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
On the Vision Pro headset, Spatial Videos are not shown full screen by default. If you expand the video, Apple warns that the video "has excess motion" and "could cause discomfort if expanded."<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-spatial-video-recording/">iOS 17.2 Beta 2 Includes Feature for Recording Spatial Video on iPhone 15 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-beta-2-includes-feature-for-recording-spatial-video-on-iphone-15-pro.2410484/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.2‌ update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌ can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.2 adds support for iMessage Contact Key Verification, a feature designed for those who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials.<br/>
<br/>
Users can ensure that there is no "man in the middle" snooping on iMessage conversations, and there is a Contact Verification Code so that iMessage users can verify that they're speaking to the correct individual during in-person meetings or on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of watchOS 10.2 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-watchos-10-2-to-developers.2410476/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.2 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-tvos-17-2-to-developers/">release of the first tvOS 17.2 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.2 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes, but tvOS 17.2 introduces an overhauled &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
The app now includes a sidebar that houses content from both Apple's services and streaming services that integrate with the tvOS Watch Now feature. There are dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>‌, MLS Season Pass, Sports, the Store, and the Library at the top of the sidebar, along with dedicated sections for streaming services like ABC, CBS, Comedy Central, Hulu, ESPN, Discovery, Peacock, Prime Video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
You can click into each streaming service to see content that's available specifically on that service, and there's also a new My TV section that replaces "My Channels."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon has nearly every model of the Aluminum Apple Watch Series 9 on sale at new record low prices in one of the first best Black Friday deals of the season. You can get the 41mm GPS model of the brand new smartwatch for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5R8BP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;349.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;399.00.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple launched the Series 9 models back in September, and since then the steepest discounts have been about &#36;10-20. This makes Amazon's sale today a notable markdown and definitely one of the overall best seen so far during Black Friday 2023. It's available in all five Aluminum models, as well as in both S/M and M/L fits.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5R8BP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm GPS) for &#36;349.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Likewise, Amazon has the 45mm GPS Apple Watch Series 9 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXF9R4Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;379.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;429.00. It's also available in all five Aluminum color options, both S/M and M/L fits, and this is another record low price on the smartwatch.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXF9R4Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm GPS) for &#36;379.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Cellular Apple Watch Series 9 deals are just as abundant on Amazon right now. You can get the 41mm Cellular model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX94FM3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;449.00</strong></a> and the 45mm Cellular model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX3T2TM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;479.00</strong></a>, both of which are &#36;50 discounts and all-time low prices. You'll again find all five Aluminum options on sale at these prices, as well as multiple size options.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[3D content has begun appearing in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app ahead of next year's Vision Pro headset launch (via <em><a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1699434273">FlatPanelsHD</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/3d-movies-apple-tv-app.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1443" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-921969" /><em>Screenshot of the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; showing the new 3D content icon (via <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1699434273">FlatPanelsHD</a>).</em></div><br/>
tvOS 17.2's redesigned &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app shows a large selection of movies with a small 3D icon that resembles a headset alongside other icons for the likes of Dolby Atmos and 4K. Since the movies are unplayable in 3D via the TV app without a Vision Pro headset, it is currently unclear what resolution and frame rate they play in. 3D titles seen in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app include <em>Jurassic World Dominion</em>, <em>Pacific Rim Uprising</em>, <em>Shrek</em>, <em>Trolls</em>, <em>Warcraft</em>, <em>Minions: The Rise of Gru</em>, <em>Mortal Engines</em>, <em>Everest</em>, <em>Kung Fu Panda 3</em>, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This 3D icon is live in the Apple TV app. <a href="https://t.co/EEKPRDVphx">https://t.co/EEKPRDVphx</a> <a href="https://t.co/PFvCiyj78B">https://t.co/PFvCiyj78B</a></p>&mdash; Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1722631501890900357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple showcased a 3D version of <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> to demonstrate some of the entertainment capabilities of the Vision Pro headset when it was unveiled in June and touted the ability to play 2D, 3D, and "immersive" movies on the device, including in a virtual cinema. Apple is also expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/12/apple-tv-monsterverse-spatial-video-vision-pro/">offer Apple TV+ content</a> in a new, immersive 3D video format, including <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Wednesday increased its estimated <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in">trade-in values</a> for select iPad and Apple Watch models in the U.S., according to the company's website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPad-Pro-and-Apple-Watch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921972" /><br/>
Apple increased trade-in values for the iPad Pro, iPad Air, entry-level iPad, Apple Watch Ultra, and Apple Watch Series 7, which could incentivize customers to upgrade these devices heading into the holiday shopping season. Trade-in values for iPhones, Macs, and other iPad and Apple Watch models did not change at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's trade-in changes are outlined below:<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Encrypted messaging app <a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a> has <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/public-username-testing-staging-environment/56866">announced</a> it is testing public account usernames so that users don't have to share their phone number to connect through the service.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/signal-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921884" /><br/>
Currently, signing up to Signal requires that you share your phone number with other users when connecting with them. While the new method still requires an account to be associated with a number during setup, it is not subsequently shared when contacting other users, making the communication even more private and secure. <br/>
<br/>
According to Signal VP of engineering Jim O'Leary, the username test is currently limited to a separate build in the platform's Staging Environment and remains "pre-beta," so it may cause crashes and other bugs to occur since it fundamentally changes the way that accounts are identified in the Signal ecosystem. <br/>
<br/>
Users who install the build will be able to share their usernames via a QR code or a link, allowing them to use it as a way for others to contact them, no phone number required. There is also an option to turn off phone number discovery in the app under Settings ➝ Privacy ➝ Phone number ➝ Who can find my number.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Signal is testing username feature. This would mean that you would not have to provide your phone number to people you want to contact. You will be able to set your phone number as private and not share it. <a href="https://t.co/OUI2S8dEtp">pic.twitter.com/OUI2S8dEtp</a></p>&mdash; Lukasz Olejnik, Ph.D, LL.M (@lukOlejnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1722349114304708669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Signal has been working on usernames since at least 2019, but it is not known when the feature will be ready for primetime. Using the pre-beta build on desktop and iOS today requires some technical knowhow involving code compiling, more information about which can be found in the <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/public-username-testing-staging-environment/56866">Signal forums</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/">Encryption</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/signal/">Signal</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/signal-private-messenger-tests-usernames/">Signal Tests Sharing Public Usernames in Place of Phone Numbers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/signal-tests-sharing-public-usernames-in-place-of-phone-numbers.2410432/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has suffered a setback in its €13 billion (&#36;14 billion) tax dispute with Brussels after an advisor to the EU's highest court said the company's victory in an earlier ruling should be thrown out (via <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/db2e63a1-9972-444f-9ae3-70bec32b020b">Financial Times</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
Giovanni Pitruzzella, advocate-general of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), said on Thursday that Apple's win in the EU General Court "should be set aside" because it is riddled with mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
While such opinions by advocates-general are non-binding, the top EU tribunal follows such advice in the majority of cases, and it is set to issue its binding ruling in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
In 2020, the General Court said it supported the EU's right to investigate national tax arrangements, but it ultimately overturned a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/30/apple-repay-14-5-billion-back-taxes-ec-rules/">ruling</a> by the European Commission stating that Apple should pay €13 billion euros in tax to the Irish government. <br/>
<br/>
Following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/16/luca-maestri-to-challenge-apple-irish-tax-ruling/">Apple's appeal</a>, the EU's second-highest court said the EU authority, led by antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/15/apple-wins-euro-tax-bill-court-appeal/">failed to show</a> that Apple had received an illegal economic advantage in Ireland over tax.<br/>
<br/>
Four years earlier, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> called the EC's original decision "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/01/tim-cook-tax-total-political-crap/">total political crap</a>" and said that Apple believed it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/30/tim-cook-open-letter-tax-evasion/">reversed</a>. "The decision is wrong, and it's not based on law or facts, it's based on politics. And I think it's very important that we stand up and say that very loudly," said Cook at the time.<br/>
<br/>
However, Pitruzzella said on Thursday the General Court ruling had "committed a series of errors" and "failed to assess correctly the substance and consequences of certain methodological errors." Pitruzzella said the court needed "to carry out a new assessment" as a result.<br/>
<br/>
Responding to the opinion of the advocates-general, Apple said on Thursday that the lower court "was very clear that Apple received no selective advantage and no State aid, and we believe that should be upheld."<br/>
<br/>
An ECJ ruling is expected next year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ireland-tax-case/">Apple-Ireland Tax Case</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/apple-could-pay-ireland-eu-tax-dispute/">Apple Could Pay &#039;Total Political Crap&#039; &#36;14 Billion Tax Bill to EU After All</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-could-pay-total-political-crap-14-billion-tax-bill-to-eu-after-all.2410427/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913688" /><br/>
Last month, <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman revealed that Apple is developing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">large array of features that use generative AI</a>, including a "smarter version of Siri" and new LLM-based AI features that will be baked into iOS 18 and iPadOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said Apple was still debating whether to limit generative AI to on-device processing, deploy it via the cloud, or adopt a hybrid approach combining the two. It was not mentioned either way whether some AI features would require specific hardware architecture or trickle down to all models capable of running iOS 18. <br/>
<br/>
However, according to new information independently shared by the leaker <a href="https://x.com/Tech_Reve/status/1722418466647625999?s=20">@Tech_Reve</a>, iOS 18 will bring the company's new LLM to millions of existing devices by using cloud-based AI, while new on-device AI features will likely remain exclusive to the iPhone 16.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of iOS 18 features, Gurman's sources mention a revamped interaction between ‌Siri‌ and the Messages app, enabling users to field complex questions and auto-complete sentences more effectively. We may also see auto-generated Apple Music playlists and integration with productivity apps like Pages and Keynote, such as AI-assisted writing and slide deck creation. Where this patina of AI integration crosses over into new hardware requirements is still unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is designing new A-series chips for the iPhone 16 lineup, built on TSMC's latest N3E 3-nanometer node. Efficiency and performance improvements are of course expected, but there could be other benefits that feed into Apple's AI intentions. Notably, TSMC is the sole manufacturer for Nvidia's powerful H100 and A100 AI processors, the hardware that powers AI tools like ChatGPT and which also comprises the majority of AI data centers.<br/>
<br/>
All models in the iPhone 16 series are also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/">rumored to have an extra button</a> that we don't know the purpose of yet. Internal versions of the iPhone 16 that Apple is working on include an extra capacitive button, known internally as the "Capture Button." <br/>
<br/>
The button is located on the same side as the Power button, and is a capacitive button that is able to detect pressure and touch, providing haptic feedback when pressed. There has been no word yet on what this button might be used for, but it could conceivably have unforeseen practical AI applications.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be on course to spend &#36;1 billion per year on AI research, with some of the company's biggest executive names overseeing development, including senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy John Giannandrea, and senior vice president of services Eddy Cue.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/revegnus/">Revegnus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">iPhone 16 Likely to Get Exclusive AI Features in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-likely-to-get-exclusive-ai-features-in-ios-18.2410420/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Disney <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2023-earnings-results-webcast/">today said</a> that it will soon combine Disney+ and Hulu into one streaming service, with a unified app to be available in a beta capacity next month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/disney.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909605" /><br/>
Disney CEO Bob Iger <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/11/disney-plus-hulu-combo-app/">first announced plans</a> to merge Hulu and Disney+ into a single app earlier this year. The app will first be offered to those who subscribe to the Disney+ and Hulu bundle, providing those customers with one app to access all their content. Right now, Disney offers a combined bundle that features Disney+ and Hulu, but subscribers need to download two separate apps. Pricing for the app has not been announced, but the current ad-supported Hulu and Disney+ bundle costs &#36;9.99 per month, while the version without ads costs &#36;19.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
During today's fourth quarter earnings call, Iger confirmed that Disney is on track to roll out the unified app in the United States starting in December, with an official launch to follow in spring 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Disney earlier this month said that it will pay Comcast over &#36;8 billion to purchase Comcast's Hulu shares, which would see Disney being the sole owner of Hulu and will allow for the combined app.<br/>
<br/>
Disney in October increased the price of both Disney+ and Hulu in an effort to bring in more revenue. Ad-free Disney+ is now priced at &#36;13.99 per month, while ad-free Hulu costs &#36;17.99 per month.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/">Hulu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/">Disney Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/disney-plus-hulu-combo-app-2/">Disney+ and Hulu Merging Into Single App, Beta Coming in December</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-and-hulu-merging-into-single-app-beta-coming-in-december.2410365/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LG and Samsung plan to begin mass production of OLED display panels for the next-generation iPad Pro models around February 2024, according to a report today from <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/it-science/ict/2023/11/08/ARI7VWL4TZDMZKCRI2NZ2AKS3Y/">South Korea's <em>Chosun Ilbo</em></a>. The news was highlighted by the <a href="https://www.oled-info.com/chosun-lgd-and-sdc-will-produce-10-million-amoled-displays-apples-ipads-next">website <em>OLED-Info</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">OLED displays, an M3 chip, and an aluminum Magic Keyboard</a> to launch next year. With mass production of the OLED displays reportedly not beginning until February, it seems unlikely that the next iPad Pro models would be ready to launch in March, a common month for Apple to announce new products. It seems more likely that the next iPad Pro models would be announced at WWDC in June or later, but Apple's plans could still change.<br/>
<br/>
The current iPad Pro models are equipped with LCD panels, and the 12.9-inch model also features mini-LED backlighting for increased brightness and a higher contrast ratio. OLED technology would eliminate the need for backlighting, with benefits including even higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, lower power consumption, and more. Apple is expected to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/ipad-pro-2024-oled-hybrid-tech/">very thin hybrid OLED displays</a> with a combination of flexible and rigid materials, which could allow for the next iPad Pro models to be slightly thinner.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors about the iPad Pro adopting OLED technology for several years, and it seems that it will finally happen next year. The next iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad are all expected to stick with LCD panels.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last updated the iPad Pro line in October 2022, with key new features at the time including the M2 chip, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 support, hover functionality for the second-generation Apple Pencil, and support for ProRes video recording.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/ipad-pro-oled-display-production-february-report/">iPad Pro OLED Display Production Reportedly to Begin Around February</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-oled-display-production-reportedly-to-begin-around-february.2410359/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular accessory maker Nomad today announced the launch of three new products that are designed for use in vehicles. The Mount, Charge Mount, and 70W Car Charger offer charging and mounting solutions for the car.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/nomad-car-mount-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921798" /><br/>
<a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/mount-black">Priced at &#36;45</a>, the Mount is a simple MagSafe-compatible accessory that is designed to attach to horizontal and vertical vehicle vents. It features a slim design with a polycarbonate and glass body. As this is just a mount, it does not offer in-car charging.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/charge-mount-black">&#36;80 Charge Mount</a> has the same design as the Mount, but it comes with a USB-C cable and an 18W USB-C Car Charger. It is able to charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at up to 7.5W and it works with any of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad's &#36;60 <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/car-charger-70w-usb-c">70W Car Charger</a> plugs into the 12V socket in the car and offers two USB-C ports for charging iPhones and even Macs. The full 70W is available to a single device if only one USB-C port is in use, otherwise the power is split between the two devices (50W to the blue port and 20W to the other port). The Car Charger features GaN technology for a slim build, but it does not come with USB-C cables so you will need to supply your own.<br/>
<br/>

Resident Evil 4 is one of the console games that can be played on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models with A17 Pro chip. The A17 Pro chip features hardware-accelerated ray tracing and improved GPU capabilities that make console-quality gaming possible.<br/>

The title will be playable on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, iPads that are equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or later, and all Apple silicon Macs. <br/>
<br/>
Capcom plans to charge &#36;59.99 for Resident Evil 4 on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, which is the same price as the game on consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Additional DLC content like new areas and weapon packs will be available at prices ranging from &#36;2.99 to &#36;19.99.<br/>
<br/>
Capcom released the Resident Evil 4 remake on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in March. Compared to the original 2005 title, the updated version includes overhauled graphics, new characters, and updated gameplay elements like crafting items and ammo from resources.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders for Resident Evil 4 are <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082?platform=iphone">available on the App Store</a>, and Capcom says that there will be a demo available for those who want to try the game out before buying.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/resident-evil-4-apple-december-20/">Resident Evil 4 Coming to iPhone, iPad and Mac on December 20</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resident-evil-4-coming-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-on-december-20.2410323/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As the end of 2023 approaches, now is a good opportunity to look back at some of the devices and accessories that Apple discontinued throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/5-Products-Apple-Discontinued-in-2023-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921716" /><br/>
Apple products discontinued in 2023 include the iPhone 13 mini, 13-inch MacBook Pro, MagSafe Battery Pack, MagSafe Duo Charger, and leather accessories.<br/>
<br/>
Also check out our lists of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/apple-discontinued-products-2022/">Apple products discontinued in 2022</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/29/5-products-discontinued-by-apple-in-2021/">2021</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Mini</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-12-Mini.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="787" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921759" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-13-mini/">discontinued the iPhone 13 mini</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series, and this marked the end of the iPhone mini entirely, although a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FG8W3LL/A/refurbished-iphone-12-mini-256gb-green-unlocked">refurbished iPhone 12 mini</a> remains available on Apple's online store in the U.S. for now.<br/>
<br/>
Equipped with a 5.4-inch display with slim bezels, the iPhone mini was a favorite among fans of smaller smartphones, but market research firms said the model had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/21/iphone-13-mini-unpopular-march-quarter/">low sales relative to other iPhone models</a>. Apple decided not to release an iPhone 14 mini last year, but it had kept the iPhone 13 mini available as a lower-cost option.<br/>
<br/>
The smallest iPhone that Apple sells brand new is now the iPhone SE with a 4.7-inch display, but it has a very outdated design with a Home button and thicker bezels, and the next iPhone SE is rumored to have a larger 6.1-inch display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>13-Inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Touch-Bar-13-Inch-MacBook-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1364" height="769" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853221" /><br/>
Apple finally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> last week following its "Scary Fast" event. The laptop had a seven-year-old design, and it was the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/">final Mac equipped with a Touch Bar</a> instead of physical function keys.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch MacBook Pro was effectively replaced with the new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M3 chip, although the former started at &#36;1,299 and the latter starts at &#36;1,599. The 14-inch model does offer several upgrades over the 13-inch model, such as the M3 chip, a 120Hz ProMotion display, a 1080p camera, and more ports.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MagSafe Battery Pack</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/magsafe-battery-pack-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2490" height="1401" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-807787" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series. <br/>
<br/>
Released in 2021, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ was priced at &#36;99 and attaches magnetically to the back of the iPhone 12 and newer, providing hours of additional battery life. While all iPhone 15 models are now equipped with a USB-C port, the battery pack has a Lightning charging port, so it effectively became outdated.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MagSafe Duo Charger</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/magsafe-duo-perspective-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1332" height="750" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770700" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">discontinued the MagSafe Duo Charger</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series.<br/>
<br/>
Released in 2020, the MagSafe Duo Charger was a &#36;129 foldable charging mat with both a MagSafe charger for iPhones and an Apple Watch magnetic charging puck. Like the MagSafe Battery Pack, it had a Lightning charging port.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Leather Accessories</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-leather-wallet-magsafe.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784716" /><br/>
Apple stopped selling leather accessories in September, including leather versions of iPhone cases, the MagSafe Wallet, Apple Watch bands, and more, as part of the company's environmental responsibility efforts. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">introduced a new FineWoven fabric material for accessories</a> that it says has a "significantly lower" carbon footprint than leather, but customers have complained about the new iPhone cases <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/">being prone to scratches and stains</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3><br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/31/apple-discontinues-itunes-movie-trailers-app/">discontinued its iTunes Movie Trailers app</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/apple-music-voice-plan-no-longer-available/">Apple Music Voice Plan</a> this year.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/apple-discontinued-these-5-products-in-2023/">Apple Discontinued These 5 Products in 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinued-these-5-products-in-2023.2410313/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
