		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.waze.com/live-map/">Waze</a> is removing Google Assistant support from its iOS app after more than a year of buggy behavior and functionality issues, and will replace it with a new Gemini-based "Conversational Reporting" feature that aims to make hands-free navigation safer and more intuitive.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Waze-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="1140" height="641" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996691" /><br/>
As reported by <em><a href="https://techissuestoday.com/waze-removing-google-assistant-ios/">Tech-Issues Today</a></em>, the Google-owned navigation app has <a href="https://www.waze.com/discuss/t/important-update-about-google-assistant-in-waze-ios/380605">acknowledged</a> that iOS users have experienced significant problems with Google Assistant integration, which has led to the decision to nix the feature rather than continue attempts to fix it. However, for Waze users on Android, where issues haven't cropped up, Google Assistant will remain in place.<br/>
<br/>
The new Conversational Reporting system, currently in beta testing with select users, allows drivers to report road hazards and traffic conditions using natural language. Instead of memorizing specific command phrases, users can speak normally with statements like "There's a crash up ahead," and the app will understand and process the information.<br/>
<br/>
If more details are needed, the system can engage in a dialogue, asking follow-up questions like "Can you tell me more about the crash?" The conversational approach aims to keep driver distraction to a minimum while maximizing the usefulness of community-reported information.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CbVVEg5WUqo?si=ArY-LOIOx9U-Gtqe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The transition is already underway – Google Assistant is being phased out of the iOS app immediately. While Waze hasn't announced a specific release date for the Gemini-powered replacement, it's expected to launch widely after the beta testing period concludes.<br/>
<br/>
The switch follows a number of recently introduced new Waze features, such as school zone alerts to warn drivers to reduce speed near educational institutions.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/waze/">Waze</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/waze-ios-conversational-reporting/">Waze on iOS Kills Buggy Google Assistant for &#039;Conversational Reporting&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/waze-on-ios-kills-buggy-google-assistant-for-conversational-reporting.2454088/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> experience is still nowhere to be seen following Porsche's <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-communication-management-change-of-the-model-year-38985.html">announcement</a> of a major upgrade of its infotainment system for 2026.<br/>
<br/>

The upcoming 2026 model year Porsche Taycan, 911, Panamera, and Cayenne feature an upgraded version of the Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system, making it more responsive, adding Dolby Atmos support, and integrating Amazon's Alexa voice assistant. The new system brings the Porsche App Center, a kind of app store for the vehicle,  to all of the new models.<br/>
<br/>
It continues to support the standard version of Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; and Android Auto. Support for Apple's next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; experience is again conspicuously missing from Porsche's new lineup, and the automaker did not mention it at all during its latest announcement—another bleak sign for the delayed feature.<br/>
<br/>
Next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will have deeper integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, climate controls, FM radio, and more. It will also support multiple displays across the dashboard, and offer widgets for apps like Calendar and Weather. In addition, next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to match their vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">first previewed next-generation CarPlay</a> at WWDC 2022. Until the end of last year, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple's website</a> said that the first vehicles with next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; support would "arrive in 2024," but this did not occur.<br/>
<br/>
Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed next-generation CarPlay vehicle designs</a> in late 2023, but neither automaker has announced any vehicles with support for it. Apple continued to highlight next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-next-generation-carplay-images/">in WWDC 2024 coding sessions</a> for developers and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-statement-on-next-generation-carplay/">shared a statement</a> in January reiterating its commitment to the feature.<br/>
<br/>
When it unveiled next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; in 2022, Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Nearly three years have gone by since Apple shared that list, however, so it is unclear if it remains entirely accurate.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/porsche/">Porsche</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/2026-porsches-still-wont-have-next-gen-carplay/">2026 Porsches Still Won&#039;t Have Next-Gen CarPlay</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2026-porsches-still-wont-have-next-gen-carplay.2454086/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the United States, the Apple Card offers a high-yield savings account option, allowing you to earn far more interest on your money compared to the average bank's basic savings account. However, the account's interest rate was lowered this week, with the annual percentage yield (APY) dropping from 3.9% to 3.75%.<br/>
<br/>

If you deposited &#36;1,000 into the account, and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn &#36;37.50 in interest based on the current APY.<br/>
<br/>

Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/">is &#36;1 million</a>, up from &#36;250,000 previously.<br/>
<br/>
When the account launched, Apple and Goldman Sachs offered an APY of 4.15%, but the rate has fluctuated, often in line with U.S. Federal Reserve benchmark rate changes. The APY peaked at 4.5% in early 2024, and the current 3.75% is an all-time low.<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots in it, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up next to Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs may <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/goldman-sachs-apple-card-partnership-end-early/">end its consumer lending partnership with Apple early</a>, but it is unclear if this will have any impact on Apple Card holders. According to recent reports, there are at least <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/apple-card-new-partner-talks/">three companies in the running to replace Goldman Sachs</a> as the Apple Card's financial partner, including Barclays, Synchrony, and JPMorgan Chase.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/apple-card-savings-rate-lowered/">Apple Card Savings Account&#039;s Interest Rate Lowered</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-accounts-interest-rate-lowered.2454085/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 16 to Launch in Indonesia on April 11 After Statewide Ban Lifted</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/id/newsroom/2025/03/iphone-16-lineup-available-from-11-April/">announced</a> the official release date of its iPhone 16 lineup in Indonesia, after the country lifted a ban on its sale following Apple's more than &#36;300 million investment plan. The iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, and iPhone 16e will launch in the Indonesian market on April 11.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-iPhone-16-family-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996656" /><br/>
The announcement indicates that the iPhone 16 series has passed the Indonesian telecommunications equipment certification – the final hurdle in the approvals process. Previously, the iPhone 16 models also obtained the local component content (TKDN) certification issued by the Indonesian Ministry of Industry, with a standard rate of 40%, exceeding the current minimum requirement of 35%.<br/>
<br/>
Indonesia blocked iPhone 16 sales in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/indonesia-bans-iphone-16-sales/">October</a> after determining that Apple had not met the country's 40% domestic content requirement for smartphones.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the monetary investment, Apple has reportedly committed to training local talent in research and development, so that Indonesians can develop software and design their own products. The pledge addresses one of the government's key demands for Apple to establish R&D facilities in the country.<br/>
<br/>
The agreement also includes plans for a manufacturing plant on Batam island that will produce AirTags, Apple's device tracking accessories. This facility will be operated by Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry, and is expected to eventually account for 20% of global AirTag production.<br/>
<br/>
Another manufacturing facility is planned for Bandung, about three hours from Jakarta, which will produce other types of accessories. Part of the investment will also fund Apple academies to equip Indonesian students with tech skills like coding.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the substantial concessions, recent reports indicate that Apple has no immediate plans to manufacture iPhones in Indonesia. That means Apple remains the only brand in the country allowed to sell imported smartphones without local manufacturing. In contrast, other manufacturers must comply with TKDN regulations by producing devices locally or contributing through software development.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/">Indonesia</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16">iPhone 16 (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/iphone-16-to-launch-in-indonesia-on-april-11/">iPhone 16 to Launch in Indonesia on April 11 After Statewide Ban Lifted</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-to-launch-in-indonesia-on-april-11-after-statewide-ban-lifted.2454077/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's forthcoming iPhone 17 Pro models are capable of shooting 8K video, up from the current maximum 4K capture resolution on the iPhone 16 series, a Chinese leaker has today suggested. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iPhone-17-Pro-34ths-Perspective.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996702" /><br/>
The Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PklblyXJq">Fixed Focus Digital</a> on Wednesday said that the iPhone 17 Pro is "something to look forward to," since 8K video will be "within the user's grasp." <br/>
<br/>
It turns out the leaker could be onto something.<br/>
<br/>
Last September, one report claimed that Apple allegedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/iphone-16-pro-4k-at-120fps-video-rumor/">tested 8K video recording</a> on the iPhone 16 Pro models. However, the capability was never enabled, likely because of hardware limitations in the current triple-lens camera setup. <br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro features 48-megapixel Fusion and Ultra Wide cameras, while the Telephoto camera is 12 megapixels. Since an 8K image is around 33 megapixels, the Fusion and Ultra Wide cameras are theoretically capable of 8K video recording, but the Telephoto camera is not.<br/>
<br/>
The same report suggested that, given the rumored 48-megapixel Telephoto camera coming to the iPhone 17 Pro, 8K video recording might debut on that device instead. Apple's iPhone 17 Pro models are now heavily rumored to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-48mp-telephoto/">three 48-megapixel rear cameras</a>, a major improvement over the current 12-megapixel Telephoto lens. That would make all three rear cameras theoretically capable of shooting 8K video for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
Several rival smartphones currently offer 8K video recording capabilities, such as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Google Pixel 9 Pro (via AI upscaling). Even though 8K video recording isn't widely used by content creators right now, there are still use cases for it. For example, shooting 8K would allow videographers to record using the Ultra Wide camera and then crop in 50% and still achieve 4K resolution.  <br/>
<br/>
Notably, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman in February <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-23/apple-abandons-budget-phones-inside-apple-s-modem-m4-macbook-air-launch-timing">reported</a> that Apple plans to emphasize the iPhone 17 Pro's improved video recording capabilities when it unveils the device later this year, although he did not reveal any specific new features that may be coming.<br/>
<br/>
This is what he said:<br/>
<blockquote>In past years, Apple has focused more heavily on the camera's photo-taking abilities. This year it will stress improvements to video recording. One of the goals for 2025's iPhone line is to get the vlogging community and other video creators to move away from standalone cameras and use the iPhone for even more of their work. Look for Apple to more heavily than ever tout these video recording capabilities when the new iPhones debut in September.</blockquote>It's quite possible that 8K video recording will be one of the capabilities that Apple will tout when the new lineup launches. Video recording capabilities already added to iPhones over the years include an Action mode for stabilization, Cinematic mode for shallow depth-of-field, and 120 fps 4K Dolby Vision video recording.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple sources have claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro models will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/iphone-17-pro-machined-parts-leak-camera-redesign/">redesigned rear camera system</a>. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are rumored to adopt a horizontal camera bar reminiscent of Google's Pixel series, and this bar is expected to span the width of the device's back, housing the triangular triple-camera setup on the left, and the flash, microphone, and LiDAR sensor on the right. <br/>
<br/>
It is not clear why Apple would use this design, nor what the extra space would be used for, but it has shown up several times now. All four iPhone 17 models are also expected to feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-more/">upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/iphone-17-pro-supports-8k-video-recording/">iPhone 17 Pro Supports 8K Video Recording, Suggests Leaker</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-supports-8k-video-recording-suggests-leaker.2454073/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Generic-iOS-19-Feature-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978988" /><br/>
According to Gurman, the images that are "floating around" are based on "very old builds" or "vague descriptions," and are lacking key features. Gurman says that we can "expect more from Apple in June."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman made the same comment about Prosser's mockups in his Power On discord channel. "He either has very old screenshots or hasn't seen the real thing," wrote Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
Prosser shared mockups that are supposedly based on the "real deal version" of &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; that he has seen, but the images feature a limited number of design changes. The Messages app mockup, for example, shows slight changes to the navigation buttons and a more rounded keyboard, while the Lock Screen has few changes beyond updates to translucency.<br/>
<br/>
Prosser said that apps, menus, settings, and more will have a more rounded aesthetic with glass-like styling modeled after visionOS, which we've also heard from Gurman and other sources.<br/>
<br/>
In his video, Prosser downplayed the changes and said that there are no signs of significant new additions beyond the minor design tweaks he demoed, but Gurman previously said that Apple's update will "fundamentally change" the look of the operating system, marking the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">biggest design refresh</a> to iOS since iOS 7.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has not provided specific details on the changes that Apple is planning to make, but he has said that Apple will update the style of icons, menus, apps, windows, and system buttons, with a look that is "loosely based" on the Vision Pro interface.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/gurman-ios-19-mockups-not-accurate/">Gurman: Jon Prosser&#039;s iOS 19 Mockups &#039;Aren&#039;t Representative&#039; of Redesign</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-jon-prossers-ios-19-mockups-arent-representative-of-redesign.2454062/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple is hosting a keynote viewing party that some developers and students will be able to attend. The event will include the keynote and Platforms State of the Union, plus attendees will be able to meet with Apple experts in labs, explore Apple's campus, and participate in special activities.<br/>
<br/>
At the 2024 WWDC event, developers and students were provided with refreshments to kick off the day, followed by the keynote event. Apple's Platforms State of the Union followed, and then there were &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; tours to choose from. The day ended with the Apple Design Awards and a dinner event.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Who Can Attend</h2><br/>
Current Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program members can apply to attend, as can Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni and Swift Student Challenge winners from 2023 to 2025.<br/>
<br/>
350 Swift Student Challenge winners for 2025 are set to be announced on Thursday, March 27. 50 Distinguished Winners will receive an invite to a special three-day experience that includes the special event on June 9, and Distinguished Winners will not need to enter the lottery. The 300 other Swift Student Challenge winners will be able to attend if they win a spot in the lottery.<br/>
<br/>
Both adults and children aged 13 to 17 can apply, but children will need to be accompanied by a legal guardian.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Lottery Selection</h2><br/>
Because there is limited space at the &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; campus, Apple will choose attendees through a random lottery. Apple says that special event passes are allocated by a random selection process, and tickets are nontransferable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Register to Go</h2><br/>
If you're eligible to enter the lottery, you can <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/special-event/">apply on Apple's developer website</a>. Apple is accepting special event pass requests until 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, April 2.<br/>
<br/>
Those who apply will be notified of their request status by the end of the day on Thursday, April 3.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Cost</h2><br/>
While Apple is not charging for the viewing event at &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj;, attendees will need to cover their own travel fees, including plane tickets and accommodations at nearby hotels.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Media Attendees</h2><br/>
Apple has not yet sent out media invites, but it is likely that select members of the media will be invited to the &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; special event.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>WWDC 2025 Dates and Viewing Info</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> will take place from Monday, June 9 to Friday, June 13. Developers who are not selected to attend Apple's special event can watch the June 9 keynote on Apple's website or on YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
For those unable to watch the live stream, or who prefer to read a text version of the announcements, we'll have &zwnj;WWDC 2025&zwnj; live coverage here on MacRumors.com and through our <a href="https://twitter.com/macrumorslive?lang=en">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>, so make sure to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to share all of the WWDC sessions and events in its Developer app and on its Apple Developer YouTube channel.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/wwdc-2025-apple-park-developer-event/">WWDC 2025 Includes In-Person Apple Park Event - Here&#039;s How to Attend</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wwdc-2025-includes-in-person-apple-park-event-heres-how-to-attend.2454061/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a> today shared a "first look" at Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> update, providing mockups of what different apps and features will supposedly look like. Prosser claims the mockups are based on "the real deal" version of &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; that he has seen, but says he is sharing replica images in order to prevent his sources from getting into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Generic-iOS-19-Feature-Mock-Light.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978991" /><br/>
Confusingly, Prosser's video features some design changes that are "real," and others that he made up as a joke. He includes a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> view with round icons rather than square icons, for example, but at the tail end of the video, he says that's not an accurate depiction of what the icons will look like.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Introducing iOS 19 Exclusive First Look" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2RKrbTkP53M" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Here's what Prosser has to say about different &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; elements:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Lock Screen</strong> - There's no functional change, but there is a visual overhaul. In Prosser's mockup, it looks similar to the current Lock Screen, with some translucency changes to notifications and a more 3D floating look to the buttons.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Settings and Popups</strong> - Menu elements, popups, and buttons have a more rounded aesthetic with a "glassy" styling.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Apps</strong> - App menus and buttons will have the same look with rounded corners, circular design, and floating style modeled after visionOS.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Keyboard</strong> - There's a more rounded design at the top with a visionOS glassy design. Prosser says that the keyboard "almost looks like it's floating."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Prior to today's video, Prosser shared mockups of the Messages and Camera apps, which have the design that he described. There are bubble-shaped floating navigation buttons and softer, rounder corners for interface elements, along with added translucency.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996605" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-19-messages-app.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" /><em>&zwnj;Jon Prosser&zwnj;'s Messages app mockup</em></div><br/>

According to Prosser, Apple's Sports app and Invites app offer an inside peek at what the &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; redesign will look like, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/apple-invites-app-hints-at-ios-19-redesign/">echoing previous discussion</a> about how Apple has already been using glassy buttons and interface elements for its newest apps.<br/>
<br/>
Prosser says that overall, there are no signs of any new major AI features or other significant additions, with &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; focusing primarily on design updates.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-19-visionos-like-design-rumors/">iOS 19 Again Rumored to Feature visionOS-Like &#039;Glassy&#039; Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-19-again-rumored-to-feature-visionos-like-glassy-design.2454059/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">unveiling the WWDC 2025 dates</a> today, Apple said that it will announce this year's Swift Student Challenge Winners on Thursday, March 27.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/2025-Swift-Student-Challenge.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969979" /><br/>
The Swift Student Challenge tasks students with creating an innovative coding project using Swift Playground or Xcode. This year's event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/03/swift-student-challenge-2025-live/">began on February 3</a>, and Apple accepted submissions for a three-week period before judging began.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to select 350 winners for the 2025 challenge, all of whom will be eligible to attend the June 9 Special Event for WWDC at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California. Winners will need to enter a lottery process to get a chance to attend.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will also choose 50 Distinguished Winners that will be recognized for "outstanding submissions." Distinguished Winners will be invited to Cupertino for a three-day experience that will include the Special Event keynote viewing along with other activities, and these winners will not need to enter the lottery to visit &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
Students who entered the challenge can expect to receive an email notifying them about their status later this week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/2025-swift-student-challenge-march-27/">Apple Announcing 2025 Swift Student Challenge Winners on March 27</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announcing-2025-swift-student-challenge-winners-on-march-27.2454056/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a> today shared a mockup of what he says the Messages app will look like in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>, demoing an interface with rounded, translucent bubble-shaped navigation buttons at the top and softer, rounder corners for the keyboard and word suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-19-messages-app.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996605" /><em>&zwnj;Jon Prosser&zwnj;'s Messages app mockup</div></em><br/>
The return button, a button for going back to the Messages list, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> button have a deeper blue shade that has a bit of a glow about it, but Prosser's mockup does not show fundamental changes to the layout. The iMessage demonstration is at 42:50 in the video below, and it lasts for about a minute.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iOS 19 looks WEIRD Genius Bar #205" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ngmmr_fhXvg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Prosser <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">previously showed off</a> a mockup of what the &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; Camera app supposedly looks like, with the updated design featuring visionOS-like translucency for the tool bar that gives more visibility to the underlying photo.<br/>
<br/>
When sharing the Camera app mockup, Prosser said that he based it on the actual &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; Camera app that he obtained from unnamed sources. He recreated the design rather than showing actual screenshots, and it appears that's what's been done here as well. Prosser noted that the Messages app and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> have not seen significant redesigns in &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;, despite rumors that we're going to see the biggest redesign since iOS 7.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985953" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-19-Alleged-Camera-App-Render.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="797" /><em>Front Page Tech's &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; Camera app mockup</em></div><br/>
Prosser says that he has an &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; video coming tomorrow, where he will share additional info on &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;'s design.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;, iPadOS 19, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 16 are rumored to be getting a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">complete design overhaul</a>, with Apple refreshing menus, system buttons, apps, icons, and more. Apple plans to focus on translucency and rounded buttons, design elements that are taken from visionOS. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, the update will "fundamentally change" the look of each operating system while also introducing a more consistent cross-platform experience.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-19-messages-app-mockup/">Here&#039;s What Apple&#039;s iOS 19 Messages App Might Look Like</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-what-apples-ios-19-messages-app-might-look-like.2454049/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">WWDC 2025 starts June 9</a>, and the logo for the conference hints at iOS 19's rumored new design.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-WWDC25-event-branding_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996564" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-visionos-redesign-rumors/">Multiple sources have claimed that iOS 19 will feature a new design</a> that is inspired by visionOS, the software platform for Apple's Vision Pro headset. The new design is expected to include more translucent buttons and menus, with a glass-like appearance. The "25" in this year's WWDC logo also has a subtle visionOS-like appearance.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 19 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/major-macos-16-redesign-biggest-since-big-sur/">and macOS 16</a> are also expected to have visionOS-like designs, which would make Apple's software platforms look more uniform.<br/>
<br/>
In January, the YouTube channel Front Page Tech shared a render of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">redesigned Camera app</a> that is allegedly planned for iOS 19.<br/>
<br/>

According to Front Page Tech host Jon Prosser, the Camera app will have more translucent buttons and menus, along with a larger viewfinder.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the visionOS-like design changes will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">extend to other interfaces on iOS 19</a>, meaning that the new look with more transparency will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-19-messages-app-mockup/">likely extend to other Apple apps</a>, notifications, and more.<br/>
<br/>

Gurman believes that iOS 19 will have the most significant design changes since iOS 7.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to unveil iOS 19 during the WWDC 2025 keynote on June 9, so we should get an official look at the new design in a few more months.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/wwdc-2025-logo-hints-at-ios-19-design/">WWDC 2025 Logo Hints at iOS 19&#039;s New Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wwdc-2025-logo-hints-at-ios-19s-new-design.2454045/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new firmware for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2 earbuds that came out earlier this year. The updated firmware has a version number of 7B30, an update to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-firmware-update/">prior 7B24 firmware</a> that Apple seeded out just after the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 launched.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989293" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/powerbeats-pro-2-2.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" /><br/>
We don't know what's included in the firmware, but the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 have a unique heart rate monitoring feature that's new to Apple earbuds, so it's possible the update is related to that feature.<br/>
<br/>
Along with heart rate monitoring that's done through optical LED sensors in the earbuds, the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 feature Active Noise Cancellation, Personalized Spatial Audio, Apple's H2 chip for connectivity, and a redesigned acoustic architecture that allows for better sound.<br/>
<br/>
The updated firmware can be installed on the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 by connecting them to power and ensuring that they are in Bluetooth range of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi. Firmware can be checked on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by going to Settings &gt; Bluetooth and tapping the Info button next to the Beats headphones in the list.

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/airpods-pro-2-hearing-aids.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964676" /><br/>
In these countries, &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 owners can take a Hearing Test to check for any hearing loss, and then turn on a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature to enhance sound if there is indeed hearing loss detected. The Hearing Aid option adjusts voices and sounds around the user to improve hearing, and it can also tweak music, videos, and phone calls to optimal sound levels using a personalized hearing profile.<br/>
<br/>
Loud Sound Reduction, another feature, can cut down on loud noise to protect hearing. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 provide passive noise reduction, using the H2 chip inside to reduce loud noise at 48,000 times per second. Loud Sound Reduction is enabled automatically in Transparency and Adaptive Audio listening modes.<br/>
<br/>
The Hearing Test can be accessed in the AirPods section of the Settings app when the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 are connected to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Hearing Aid capabilities are only available to users with mild to moderate hearing loss.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are coming to the new countries with the launch of iOS 18.4 and the latest firmware update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple began rolling out the hearing health features with the launch of iOS 18.1. The Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are available in <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/airpods-pro/feature-availability/">more than 100 countries and regions</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> Apple has also added <a href="https://www.apple.com/my/newsroom/2025/03/groundbreaking-health-features-available-today-on-apple-watch-and-airpods-pro-2/">sleep apnea detection</a> functionality in Malaysia.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/airpods-pro-2-hearing-health-australia/">AirPods Pro 2 Hearing Health Features Expand to More Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-2-hearing-health-features-expand-to-more-countries.2454041/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-the-week-of-june-9/">today announced</a> that its 36th annual Worldwide Developers Conference will begin on Monday, June 9, and end on Friday, June 13. As with WWDC events since 2020, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> will primarily be an online event that is open to all developers, with no associated cost.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-WWDC25-event-branding_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996564" /><br/>
Every WWDC begins with a keynote that happens on the first day of the event, and this year's keynote will take place on June 9. Apple will unveil <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, tvOS 19, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;WWDC 2025&zwnj; will feature online sessions and labs so that developers can learn about the new software features and how to incorporate those features into their apps. Both the keynote and the online sessions will be available on the Apple Developer app, Apple website, and YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
While &zwnj;WWDC 2025&zwnj; is an online event, Apple is planning a special in-person component for select developers and students. The in-person WWDC event will take place on June 9 at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California. Invited attendees will be able to watch the keynote and State of the Union at &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj;, as well as meet with Apple employees.<br/>
<br/>
Current Apple Developer Program members, Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni, prior Swift Student Challenge winners, and current Apple Developer Enterprise Program members <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/">can enter to attend</a> the June 9 &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; event, and Apple will choose participants through a random lottery.<br/>
<br/>
Apple held its Swift Student Challenge in February this year, and winners are set to be announced soon. Those who are named Distinguished Winners will be invited to Cupertino for a multi-day experience.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to provide developers with additional information about &zwnj;WWDC 2025&zwnj; through the Apple Developer app and the Apple Developer website as June approaches.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">Apple Announces WWDC 2025 Event for June 9 to 13</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-wwdc-2025-event-for-june-9-to-13.2454039/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that Apple Music is now integrated with many DJ software and hardware platforms, allowing DJs with an Apple Music subscription to build and mix sets from Apple Music's catalog of more than 100 million songs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/DJ-With-Apple-Music.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996552" /><br/>
The popular DJing app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/djay-dj-app-ai-mixer/id450527929">djay</a> by Algoriddim already offered Apple Music integration since last year, and additional platforms that are now supported include AlphaTheta, Serato, and inMusic's Engine DJ, Denon DJ, Numark, and RANE DJ. For example, you can now access the entire Apple Music catalog in AlphaTheta's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rekordbox-dj-app-dj-mixer/id1487048203">rekordbox</a> app for iPhone and iPad.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple Music support has finally arrived," says the release notes for today's rekordbox update.<br/>
<br/>
The integrations are part of a new "DJ with Apple Music" program, with more DJing platforms likely to participate in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music has launched a related <a href="https://music.apple.com/curator/dj-with-apple-music/1798261090">"DJ with Apple Music" page</a> that spotlights a series of DJ-friendly editorial playlists and more.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple Music is committed to supporting DJs," said Stephen Campbell, Global Head of Dance, Electronic & DJ Mixes at Apple Music, in an emailed press release. "This innovation brings the full power of Apple Music into the creative workflow, making it easier than ever for DJs to access, play, and discover music in real time."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/dj-with-apple-music/">Apple Music Now Integrated With More DJ Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-now-integrated-with-more-dj-apps.2454033/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Music Classical was updated today with time-synced listening guides, curated stations, and personalized recommendations on the Home tab of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-Music-Classical-Listening-Guide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996554" /><br/>
"Dive deeper with time-synced listening guides for 150+ popular works, enjoy nonstop music with curated stations, and get daily personalized recommendations on Home," says the release notes for Apple Music Classical version 2.2, released today.<br/>
<br/>
Listening guides provide details about classical music in real time, with descriptions appearing on the screen as you listen. At launch, the feature is available for more than 100 works, in English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Simplified Chinese.<br/>
<br/>
"From identifying the instruments they're hearing to explaining the drama behind a symphony or a concerto, the expert commentary turns the listening experience into a learning experience by opening doors on some of the most enduring and admired works of classical music,"  an Apple spokesperson said, in an email.<br/>
<br/>
As for the curated stations, they are arranged by instrument, composer, period, and genre. They are curated by Apple Music Classical's editors.<br/>
<br/>
Last, personalized recommendations improve classical music discovery based on your Apple Music Classical listening history.<br/>
<br/>
"The features in this update are the most significant additions to Apple Music Classical since launch," said Apple Music Classical director Anjali Malhotra.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music Classical is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music-classical/id1598433714">available in the App Store</a> for the iPhone and iPad, and it also recently became <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/apple-music-classical-on-web/">available on the web</a>. Apple Music Classical is also available on CarPlay and Android, but there is still no Mac app for the service.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music Classical launched in most countries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/apple-music-classical-begins-rolling-out/">in March 2023</a>, allowing users with a standard Apple Music subscription to stream more than five million classical music tracks, at no additional cost. Apple Music Classical is based on Primephonic, a classical music streaming service that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/apple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-service/">acquired by Apple in 2021</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music-classical/">Apple Music Classical</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-music-classical-three-new-features/">Apple Music Classical Updated With Three New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-classical-updated-with-three-new-features.2454032/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is on the cusp of releasing iOS 18.4, which brings Apple Intelligence to the European Union for the first time. However, iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing is still missing from Apple's RC build of the operating system in the EU because of regulatory concerns.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iPhone-Mirroring-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959440" /><br/>
Apple this week seeded to developers and beta testers its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/apple-releases-ios-18-4-rc/">RC (Release Candidate) build of iOS 18.4</a>, which is meant to be a near-final version that, unless major issues are found, will be the same as the public release expected in April. <br/>
<br/>
With the upcoming software update, iPhone and iPad users in the EU will have access to Apple Intelligence features, with the AI suite of features also available in more languages. However, the RC build indicates that Apple is still leaving out iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing features in the EU due to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-europe-delay/">regulatory uncertainties</a> brought about by the Digital Markets Act (DMA).<br/>
<br/>
iPhone Mirroring lets users mirror their iPhone to their Mac, while SharePlay Screen Sharing lets users share their iPhone or iPad screen during a FaceTime call, enabling them to watch videos, listen to music, or browse apps together with others. It is not clear how long it will take Apple to expand these features to the EU, nor what changes Apple might have to make to introduce them under the DMA. We've reached out to Apple for comment and will update readers if we hear back.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-iphone-mirroring-shareplay-missing-eu/">iOS 18.4: iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing Still Missing in EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-iphone-mirroring-shareplay-screen-sharing-still-missing-in-eu.2454029/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expected to release iOS 18.4 to the general public as soon as next week, following more than a month of beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Generic-iOS-18.4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984205" /><br/>
Apple's website says some iOS 18.4 features will be released in "early April," so the update should be out as early as Tuesday, April 1.<br/>
<br/>
Apple this week seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/apple-releases-ios-18-4-rc/">iOS 18.4 Release Candidate</a>, which is typically the final beta version, barring the discovery of any major last-minute software bugs. iOS updates are typically released one week after the Release Candidate, and next week will be early April, so that would align with the timeframe that Apple has provided.<br/>
<br/>
There is always a possibility of a Release Candidate 2, however, which could push back the release schedule by up to one more week.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4 is compatible with the iPhone XS series and newer, and it will be available in the Settings app under General → Software Update once it is released.<br/>
<br/>
While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/03/siri-2025-updates/">personalized Siri features</a> that were originally expected to launch as part of iOS 18.4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">have been delayed</a>, the update still includes a handful of new features. There are a few Apple Intelligence additions, including Priority Notifications, along with an Ambient Music feature in Control Center, new emoji options, support for lossless audio and low-latency audio on AirPods Max with a USB-C port, and more.<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-4-features/">All of the New Features in iOS 18.4</a></li><br/>
