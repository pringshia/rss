		<description><![CDATA[Apple revealed during Tuesday's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">"Wonderlust" event</a> that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> will be released for Apple Watch Series 4 and later models on Monday, September 18.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nrcFuBp3Cso?si=Q67vzYv5usclK-Hh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
When the update rolls out, users will immediately have to familiarize themselves with new functions assigned to the common gestures and physical buttons on their Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
In &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, Control Center is now accessed by pressing the side button, while swiping up from any watch face reveals widgets in a customizable Smart Stack that can be swiped through to see relevant information. Turning the Digital Crown achieves the same thing. <br/>
<br/>
Many stock apps have been entirely revamped with a simpler, information-forward design. Weather, for example, shows the temperature and conditions of your current location, with a quick scroll offering an hourly forecast so you no longer have to tap to get more information.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also added two new watch faces, Palette and Snoopy, and there are updates to Cycling and Hiking workouts, along with mental health integrations to support new health features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. Users can log their state of mind and mood using the Apple Watch, with the device providing insights into mental health over time.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; also adds support for Apple's forthcoming NameDrop feature in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;. Rather than type in the number of someone new to call or text them so that they have your number, NameDrop allows you to simply hold your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> near their ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌ to swap contact details. NameDrop works between two iPhones‌, and between an ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ and an Apple Watch. The feature also works between two Apple Watches.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, in Apple Fitness+, a new Custom Plans feature allows users to tailor workout routines by selecting day, duration, workout type, music, and trainer. <br/>
<br/>
Apple yesterday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-watchos-10-rc/">seeded</a> the release candidate version of the upcoming update to developers for testing purposes. The release candidate, or RC, represents the final version of the software that will be released to the public, barring the last-minute discovery of any show-stopping bugs.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/apple-watchos-10-release-date-september-18/">Apple to Release watchOS 10 on Monday, September 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-release-watchos-10-on-monday-september-18.2401505/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> succeeds 2022's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, bringing over 35 new features and improvements to Apple's high-end smartphones. This buyer's guide breaks down every major difference you should be aware of between the two generations. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-14-Pro-vs-15-Pro-Buyers-Guide.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910682" /><br/>
In 2022, Apple unveiled the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; as the successor to the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro, introducing an always-on display, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a 48-megapixel camera, the A16 Bionic chip, longer battery life, and more. The &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; Max have now been discontinued by Apple, and as slightly older models, lower prices can be found for the device at third-party resellers. As such, some customers who own an older device may be weighing up whether to upgrade to an &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; or an &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
As the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; share a large number of features, should you consider buying or sticking with the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; to save money? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models is best for you, and serves as a way to clearly see the all of the differences that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; brings to the table.<br/>
<br/>
Although the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; share most of their basic features, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; offers a large number of notable upgrades over its predecessor, such as a titanium design, Action button, USB-C port, and A17 Bionic chip.<br/>

<br/>
Overall, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; is a fairly significant upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj;, introducing meaningful quality-of-life features like the USB-C port and Action button that change the methods of interaction with the device. The new, considerably more lightweight titanium design, slimmer borders around the display, and contoured edges result in a noticeably different aesthetic and feel in the hand.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; also brings advancements to photography and videography, adding support for 24-megapixel high-resolution photos, Smart HDR 5, and next-generation portraits – practical features that most users can take advantage of. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max takes things to the next level with its tetraprism telephoto camera, offering up to 5x optical zoom on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for the first time. Features like 48-megapixel HEIF capture, external and log recording, Academy Color Encoding System, and fast data transfer via USB 3 are also major upgrades for professionals.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to mention Roadside Assistance via satellite, new color options, the second-generation ultra wideband chip, and the A17 Pro chip – Apple's first chip made with a &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; fabrication process, which radically improves the gaming capabilities of the device.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the scale and breadth of these improvements, some &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; users can justify upgrading to the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, especially if they value the new design, USB-C port, Action button, and camera improvements. It is only worth sticking with the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; if you are holding off for an even more substantial upgrade in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Customers coming from an older model also have good reason to preference the latest model over the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; due to the relatively large number of improvements and additional features offered by the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, but it depends on just how inexpensively last year's Pro models can now be obtained.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14-Pro">iPhone 14 Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro vs. iPhone 15 Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 35+ Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-buyers-guide-35-upgrades-compared.2401473/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/cellular/">cellular band page</a> confirms that only U.S. models of the new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max support mmWave 5G bands, as has been the case since the iPhone 12 series was released in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-lineup-Action-button-230912.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910375" /><br/>
mmWave is a set of 5G frequencies that promise ultra-fast speeds at short distances, which is ideal for dense urban areas. By comparison, sub-6GHz 5G is generally slower than mmWave, but the signals travel further, better serving suburban and rural areas. All four iPhone 15 models support sub-6GHz 5G outside of the U.S., and sub-6GHz networks are still more common than mmWave networks in countries that have rolled out 5G.<br/>
<br/>
Australia, China, Japan, and Singapore are some of the countries outside of the U.S. that have deployed mmWave networks so far.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">announced the iPhone 15 series</a> on Tuesday during its "Wonderlust" event. All four new models are equipped with a USB-C port and the Dynamic Island, while the Pro models have many additional features, including the A17 Pro chip, a lightweight titanium frame, a customizable Action button, 5x optical zoom on the Pro Max model, Wi-Fi 6E support, an increased 8GB of RAM, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, due for release on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/ios-17-launch-date-announced-apple/">Monday, September 18</a>, Apple is bringing a big update to its Phone app, and one of the headlining new features is Contact Posters. Keep reading to learn what they are and how to use them.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Contact-Posters-iOS-17.jpg" alt="" width="2612" height="1828" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898862" /><br/>
Apple in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; is offering <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users a new way to express themselves when it comes to calls, with personalizable Contact Posters. <br/>
<br/>
Contact Posters allow you to customize how you're represented when you give people a call. You can use photos and emoji to personalize your Contact Poster, which appears on a person's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when you phone them. And like the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Lock Screen, you can match images with eye-catching typography.<br/>
<br/>
But your Contact Poster doesn't just show up in calls. It's also part of your contact card in the Contacts app, giving consistency in the places where you communicate and share. Apple is also making APIs available to developers so that Contact Posters appear for third-party VoIP apps, too.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned above, customizing your Contact Poster works a lot like personalizing your Lock Screen. You can choose an image, font, and color. The following steps show you how it's done on devices running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Contacts</strong> app and tap on your own name.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>Contact Photo & Poster</strong> option.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Edit</strong>, then tap <strong>Customize</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Poster</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Use the buttons at the bottom of the screen to take a photo, choose a photo you want to use from your library, pick a Memoji, or add a simple Monogram of your initials.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/create-contact-poster-ios-2.jpg" alt="contacts" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910195" /><br/>
<li>To go along with your chosen image, you can optionally customize the font size, style, and color. (Note that you cannot change your name from this interface - that needs to be done by changing your contact info.)</li><br/>
<li>Swipe across the poster to preview a selection of filters, including black and white, duotone, and color wash in the color of your choice. </li><br/>
<li>When you're ready, tap <strong>Done</strong> to preview what a person sees when you call them. If you're happy with the look, tap <strong>Continue</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Now you can opt to edit the crop of your Contact Photo, choose a different photo to use, or <strong>Skip</strong> this step.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/create-contact-poster-ios1.jpg" alt="contacts" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910196" /></ol><br/>
That's your Contact Poster and Contact Photo complete. Contact Posters can be shared with your contacts automatically, or you can be prompted to share with anyone who calls you so no one sees your custom imagery without your permission.<br/>
<br/>
Note that to account for Contact Posters, the design of the Contacts app has been tweaked. When you tap on a contact, you'll now see that their contact image, Memoji, or initials take up a much larger portion of the screen. This also counts for contacts where you've assigned an image.<br/>

You can opt to tap on the Contact Photo and Poster option underneath the person's name to choose to update to the latest info automatically when your contact changes something like their profile photo, or turn on manual updates so you're prompted for the update.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/contacts/">Contacts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-17-how-to-create-your-own-contact-poster/">iOS 17: How to Create Your Own Contact Poster</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-how-to-create-your-own-contact-poster.2401459/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hermès has <a href="https://www.hermes.com/us/en/category/watches/apple-watch-hermes/#|">debuted</a> its new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> case and band collection, including some new leather band options not available from Apple's website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/hermes-apple-watch-series-9.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910666" /><br/>
Apple has removed all leather <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> cases and Apple Watch bands – including Hermès bands – from its website as part of a significant new sustainability push. However, as part of the continuing partnership between Apple and Hermès, the luxury watch boutique is free to continue selling &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; models with bands made of calfskin. <br/>
<br/>
Among several new Hermès Single Tour and Double Tour bands made of knitted nylon and woven nylon, several color options made of calfskin can be found. Prices for Hermès &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; bands range from &#36;349 to &#36;589, while watch and band combinations range from &#36;1,249 to &#36;1,539.<br/>
<br/>
All of the bands are available to pre-order today. Hermès will begin shipping orders after September 22, <a href="https://www.hermes.com/us/en/category/watches/apple-watch-hermes/#|">according to its website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As for Apple, the company on Tuesday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">announced</a> a new textile it's calling "FineWoven," which is made of 68 percent post-consumer content and is overall more environmentally friendly compared to the company's previous line of leather accessories. Apple also confirmed it will no longer use leather for new Apple accessories.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[France on Tuesday ordered Apple to halt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> sales and "fix" existing devices over fears the devices emit too much electromagnetic radiation (via <em><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20230912-france-orders-apple-to-halt-iphone-12-sales-due-to-high-radiation-levels">France24</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/iphone-12-vs-iphone-12-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1498" height="846" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764508" /><br/>
The French agency that regulates radio frequencies, the ANFR, said on its <a href="https://www.anfr.fr/liste-actualites/actualite/temporary-withdrawal-from-the-market-of-the-iphone-12-for-non-compliance-with-eu-regulation">website</a> that testing found the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; emits more electromagnetic waves susceptible to be absorbed by the body than permitted. <br/>
<br/>
The ANFR ordered Apple to "remove the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; from the French market from September 12 due to the model exceeding the limit" for electromagnetic absorption by the body. The agency also told Apple to recall every &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; it has ever sold in the country. Apple launched the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; in 2020 and it is still sold across the globe.<br/>
<br/>
"Concerning phones already sold, Apple must in the briefest of delays take corrective measures to bring the affected phones into compliance," said the ANFR in a statement on its website. "Otherwise, Apple will have to recall them."<br/>
<br/>
The ANFR said the device's Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) was 5.74 watts per kilogram, which is above the limit set by the European Union for a phone when held or kept in a pocket. The ANFR said it intends to share its findings with other EU regulators.<br/>
<br/>
The findings contradict advice given by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/electromagnetic-fields-and-public-health-mobile-phones">WHO website</a>, based on data from a large number of studies, "no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use."<br/>
<br/>
Apple told the <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66795168">BBC</a></em> it was contesting the ANFR's review, and said it had provided the regulator with its own lab results as well as third parties which show the device is compliant with all the relevant rules. Apple said the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; was recognised as being compliant with regulations on radiation levels worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't the first time Apple has come under regulatory scrutiny in the country. Under a <a href="https://www.senat.fr/rap/l08-552-1/l08-552-1102.html">previous French law</a>, Apple was until January 2022 lawfully obligated to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/15/apple-france-earpods-in-box-iphone/">include EarPods in the box</a> based on the precautionary principle, because regulators said the risks of exposing developing brains to electromagnetic waves are not clearly known.<br/>
<br/>
France in 2020 also widened regulations requiring retailers to display the radiation value of products on packaging beyond smartphones, including tablets and other electronic devices.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; order, Apple must respond to it within two weeks, the ANFR said.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/france/">France</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/france-orders-end-to-iphone-12-sales-radiation/">France Orders End to iPhone 12 Sales Over Radiation Level Concerns</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/france-orders-end-to-iphone-12-sales-over-radiation-level-concerns.2401438/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Tuesday made <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/">second-generation AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case</a> available to order, but unlike its move to wireless charging cases, the company isn't offering the USB-C case as a standalone purchase.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/AirPods-USB-C-Port.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="735" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910545" /><br/>
Apple's decision not to offer the USB-C case as a separate purchase is likely a marketing one related to the fact that the updated second-generation AirPods Pro feature improved IP54-rated dust resistance, and will support up to 4 hours of lossless audio with ultra-low latency when connected to the Apple Vision Pro headset launching in early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Similarly odd (but unsurprising?) that if you want a USB-C charging case you need a whole new &#36;249 pair. Apple isn't selling a standalone case like they did with the move to wireless charging cases. <a href="https://t.co/XXANobWF4M">https://t.co/XXANobWF4M</a> <a href="https://t.co/7aNV0ysjrw">https://t.co/7aNV0ysjrw</a></p>&mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1701798958723703144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div><br/>
Regardless, the lack of an option to purchase the USB-C case separately is likely to frustrate customers who already own second-generation AirPods Pro with a Lightning port and plan to upgrade to an iPhone 15, which features a USB-C port for the first time. Those wanting to charge all their devices with one cable will need to buy the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-usb-c-lightning-adapter-and-more/">USB-C to Lightning adapter</a> (&#36;29), while those who want to future-proof for Apple Vision Pro compatibility will have to buy a completely new pair of AirPods Pro costing &#36;249.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/">USB-C</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/usb-c-airpods-pro-case-not-sold-separately/">Apple Not Offering USB-C AirPods Pro Cases As a Standalone Purchase</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-not-offering-usb-c-airpods-pro-cases-as-a-standalone-purchase.2401420/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple announced during its "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">Wonderlust</a>" event that Emergency SOS via Satellite and Find My via Satellite will be available in Spain and Switzerland later in September.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/Emergency-SOS-via-Satellite-iPhone-YT.jpg" alt="" width="3564" height="1996" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-873000" /><br/>
Both features are currently available in 14 countries and regions, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, the U.K., and the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
Emergency SOS via Satellite was introduced with the iPhone 14 models and can be activated when an emergency situation occurs and there is no WiFi or cellular connection available. While the feature is geared to help users in a genuine emergency, Apple's satellites also make it possible for anyone to share their location whenever they are off the grid via Find My.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/15/share-location-satellite-find-my/">How to Share Your Location via Satellite With Find My</a></li></ul><br/>
The feature's upcoming availability in Spain and Switzerland is likely tied either to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">iPhone 15 series launch</a> in those countries or the availability of iOS 17, which is being released globally to the general public on September 18.<br/>
<br/>
Apple during its event also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/roadside-assistance-via-satellite/">announced</a> new Roadside Assistance vis Satellite, which is similar to Emergency SOS, but it allows iPhone users to contact roadside assistance if they have car trouble in an area without cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity. Available only in the United States for now, Roadside Assistance is being offered through a partnership with AAA.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emergency-sos-via-satellite/">Emergency SOS via Satellite</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/emergency-sos-via-satellite-spain-switzerland/">Emergency SOS via Satellite Coming to Spain and Switzerland Later This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/emergency-sos-via-satellite-coming-to-spain-and-switzerland-later-this-month.2401412/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today gave members of the media that were at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> for the "Wonderlust" event a chance to take a look at the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a> 2 models ahead of their release. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan attended, getting a first look at the new color options, Double Tap, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SiDOYCh1Zo0" title="Hands-On With Apple Watch Series 9 &amp; Apple Watch Ultra 2 Models!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The major new feature for both the Series 9 and the Ultra 2 is the updated S9 chip, a welcome update because prior to this, the chip in the Apple Watch hadn't been updated since the Series 6 even though Apple was changing the S-name with each generation. The S9 chip has 60 percent more transistors than the S8 chip in the Series 8, and it processes machine learning tasks up to 2x faster.<br/>
<br/>
With the S9 chip, there's a new Double Tap gesture (coming in October). Double Tap lets you double tap your index finger and thumb together to answer a call, play and pause music, open a notification, and more. It uses the various sensors in the Apple Watch and it works surprisingly well.<br/>
<br/>
Both the Series 9 and Ultra 2 have brighter displays (2,000 nits and 3,000 nits maximum, respectively) for better performance in the sun, and they can drop down to 1 nit at night or when you're in a movie theater. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> requests are also now processed on device, and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can answer health questions like how well you slept or what your heart rate is at.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a new U2 chip that can be used for finding your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with Precision Finding, and dictation is 25 percent more accurate. All of the new models come with an increased 64GB of storage space, up from 32GB.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added a new pink aluminum color for the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;, which is an attractive shade, plus the watch comes in starlight, midnight, and PRODUCT(RED). The stainless steel models are available in graphite, gold, and silver.<br/>
<br/>
The Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watch models can be preordered starting today, and will launch on September 22 alongside the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-watch-ultra-2-series-9-hands-on/">Hands-On With the New Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-the-new-apple-watch-series-9-and-apple-watch-ultra-2-models.2401372/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple never publicly advertises the amount of RAM included in iPhones, but <em>MacRumors</em> has confirmed that the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 8GB of RAM, up from 6GB in the iPhone 14 Pro models. Along with the new A17 Pro chip, extra RAM benefits overall system performance, particularly for multitasking.<br/>

In the Xcode 15 Release Candidate made available today, there are files confirming that the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with 6GB of RAM, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max each have 8GB of RAM. This information was obtained with assistance from software code researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613">@aaronp613</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Previous RAM amounts:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 14:</strong> 6GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 14 Plus:</strong> 6GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 14 Pro:</strong> 6GB</li><br/>

<li><strong>iPhone 15 Plus:</strong> 6GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro:</strong> 8GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max:</strong> 8GB</li></ul>The same Xcode files accurately revealed RAM amounts <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/iphone-14-ram-amounts/">for the iPhone 14 models</a> last year and in several previous iPhone generations. The type of RAM in the iPhone 15 models remains unknown, but teardowns of the devices should confirm that information soon.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models will be available to pre-order starting Friday, September 15 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time in the U.S. and over 40 other countries and regions.

		<description><![CDATA[While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/">new AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case</a> are still classified as second-generation AirPods Pro, the earbuds have a few other new features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/AirPods-USB-C-Port.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="735" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910545" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-upgrades-airpods-pro-2nd-generation-with-usb-c-charging/">press release</a> today, Apple announced that the updated second-generation AirPods Pro will support 20-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio with ultra-low latency when the earbuds are connected to Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Vision Pro</a> headset launching in early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
"When Apple Vision Pro is available early next year in the U.S., customers will be able to enjoy the most advanced wireless audio experience in the industry with the new AirPods Pro for exceptional entertainment, gaming, FaceTime calls, and so much more," said Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also said the updated AirPods Pro have additional IP54-rated dust resistance for both the earbuds and the charging case.<br/>
<br/>
The updated AirPods Pro are <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTJV3AM/A/airpods-pro">available to order starting today</a> for &#36;249, and will be available in stores beginning Friday, September 22. Apple is not selling the USB-C charging case separately, and it has discontinued the AirPods Pro with a Lightning case. The standard third-generation AirPods and the AirPods Max were not updated today.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/new-airpods-pro-features/">New AirPods Pro Feature Lossless Audio With Vision Pro and Additional Dust Resistance</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-airpods-pro-feature-lossless-audio-with-vision-pro-and-additional-dust-resistance.2401361/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 15&#039;s USB-C Port Can Charge Your Apple Watch and AirPods</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models have a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port, it is possible to use an &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; to charge the AirPods or Apple Watch directly.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
You'll need an appropriate cable to charge with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, such as a USB-C to USB-C cable for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 USB-C Charging Case, or a USB-C Apple Watch charging puck, but it's a useful function that wasn't available with Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
Apple highlighted the new functionality in its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-unveils-iphone-15-pro-and-iphone-15-pro-max/">iPhone 15 Pro announcement</a> and it makes sense because USB-C Macs can be used for charging the AirPods and Apple Watch, but it is novel because we aren't accustomed to charging accessories with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
If your AirPods or Apple Watch run out of battery while you don't have access to a charger, it is convenient to be able to use the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s battery for a little extra juice rather than carrying around a battery pack.<br/>
<br/>
USB-C brings other conveniences, such as the ability to use the same charging cable for Macs, iPads, iPhones, and other USB-C accessories. On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, it also brings faster USB 3 transfer speeds of up to 10Gb/s, provided you're using the right cable. &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are limited to USB 2 charging speeds, the same as the Lighting port.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-usb-c-port-apple-watch-airpods-charging/">iPhone 15&#039;s USB-C Port Can Charge Your Apple Watch and AirPods</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15s-usb-c-port-can-charge-your-apple-watch-and-airpods.2401360/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following today's keynote event that saw Apple introducing the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, Apple allowed members of the media in attendance to spend some hands-on time with the new devices. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera was at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> for the event, so he's able to give us an early look at the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup, as well as his first thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ifzb4pwzRVM" title="Hands-On With Apple&#39;s New iPhone 15 &amp; iPhone 15 Pro Models!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models are made from titanium, and they are noticeably lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> models. There are contoured edges that improve the feel of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in the hand, and the Pro models are overall much more comfortable to hold. Apple also cut down on bezel size for even more display than ever, and the Action Button that replaces the Mute Switch is super convenient.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added a 5x zoom lens to the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max and at its 120mm focal length, you can get great portrait shots. There are options on both Pro models to change the focal length of the Main camera, which you can do just by tapping. It can be set to 24mm, 28mm, or 35mm, and the ability to change focal length is useful for pro photographers. <br/>
<br/>
As for the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, they're more Pro-like than ever with the addition of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and the new matte glass back. Apple say it is using back glass that has color infused throughout the material, and it's a nice look, especially with the pastel color options.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max include support for the Thread mesh networking protocol. Thread networking technology is listed as a new feature for the Pro models, but it is not included in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-gray.jpg" alt="" width="1876" height="1055" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910519" /><br/>
Apple says that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; is the first smartphone with a Thread radio, which can be used to directly control Thread-enabled smart home products. Thread has previously been added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, but no other Apple devices have Thread connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
In the press release for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, Apple explains that Thread opens up "future opportunities for Home app integrations."<br/>
<br/>
Thread is a mesh smart home network system that improves the connectivity and responsiveness of connected products. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-thread-support/">Apple Adds Thread Networking Technology to iPhone 15 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-thread-networking-technology-to-iphone-15-pro.2401316/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are the first iPhones to support next-generation Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, with the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models continuing to be limited to Wi-Fi 6.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-iphone-15-white-titanium.jpg" alt="" width="2084" height="1172" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910514" /><br/>
With Wi-Fi 6E support, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max can connect to the 6GHz band offered by Wi-Fi 6E routers for faster speeds, improved latency, and less interference from other devices.<br/>
<br/>
Connecting to Wi-Fi 6E does require a Wi-Fi 6E router, but there are multiple options on the market now. There are still a limited number of devices that have Wi-Fi 6E support, so for now, the 6GHz band has a lot less congestion.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been adding Wi-Fi 6E support to its devices since 2022. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213433">It is available</a> in the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> machines.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-models-wi-fi-6e/">iPhone 15 Pro Models Support Wi-Fi 6E</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-models-support-wi-fi-6e.2401312/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At today's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> event, Apple introduced an add-on feature to Emergency SOS via Satellite called Roadside Assistance via Satellite. The feature is similar to Emergency SOS, but it allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to contact roadside assistance if they have car trouble in an area without cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-roadside-assistance.jpg" alt="" width="1596" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910510" /><br/>
Roadside Assistance via Satellite is available for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, but it is also a feature that is retroactively available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> lineup. Available in the United States, roadside assistance is being offered through a partnership with AAA.<br/>
<br/>
The functionality is included in an AAA membership, but Apple said that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users can also get access separately. The company did not provide details on what it would cost without an AAA membership, but AAA is priced starting at &#36;65 per year.<br/>
<br/>
As with Emergency SOS via Satellite, you can text roadside assistance and choose what you need help with. Options demonstrated at the event included flat tire, no fuel, locked out, vehicle stuck, and vehicle does not start.<br/>
<br/>
Apple includes two years of Emergency SOS via Satellite and Roadside Assistance via Satellite connectivity for free with the purchase of an &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. Note that in the case of Roadside Assistance, you need the satellite connectivity and to pay the additional fee to AAA.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emergency-sos-via-satellite/">Emergency SOS via Satellite</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14">iPhone 14 (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14-Pro">iPhone 14 Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/roadside-assistance-via-satellite/">Apple Announces New Roadside Assistance via Satellite Feature for iPhone 14 and iPhone 15</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-new-roadside-assistance-via-satellite-feature-for-iphone-14-and-iphone-15.2401306/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max features a new Telephoto lens that uses a tetraprism design to enable 5x optical zoom, an improvement over the 3x zoom that's available in the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and the prior-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and Pro Max models. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-camera.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910485" /><br/>
5x optical zoom allows for 25x digital zoom, and while that's the most zoom an Apple device has offered, it still falls below the competition. <br/>
<br/>
Samsung's latest Galaxy S23 Ultra smartphone has 100x Space Zoom that can capture images from 330 feet away. The Pixel 7 Pro has 30x digital "Super Res Zoom" with its 5x optical zoom lens.  Apple has never leaned into digital zoom because the quality is poor. Optical zoom provides a crisp, clear image using the camera hardware, but digital zoom uses software enhancement to crop in. <br/>
<br/>
5x optical zoom is an &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max-specific feature that is not available on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. Both devices share other camera improvements, though. The 48-megapixel main camera has a larger sensor that lets in more light, and it can be set to 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths. <br/>
<br/>
There's also an updated 13mm Ultra Wide camera, and second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/">iPhone 15 Pro Max&#039;s 5x Optical Zoom Lens Enables 25x Digital Zoom</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-maxs-5x-optical-zoom-lens-enables-25x-digital-zoom.2401302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
