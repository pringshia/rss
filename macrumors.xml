		<description><![CDATA[Popular accessory brand <a href="https://www.ugreen.com">Ugreen</a> has built up a veritable lineup of portable power banks and chargers in the last few years, with several options to serve the needs of gadget users on the road. It can be hard to work out what kind of unit will meet your particular requirements, but if you are looking for a compact USB-C/A bank that has enough juice to fully recharge your smartphone and laptop and then some, Ugreen's Nexode 100W power bank could be worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/1ugreen-nexode-100w-power-bank.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959117" /><br/>
I've been testing out the Nexode for a few weeks now, and I've come away impressed enough that it's become an ever-present accessory in my laptop bag, and I don't leave the house without it when I'm working away from home. <br/>
<br/>
Normally priced at &#36;79.99 (and sometimes quite a lot cheaper if you shop around online), it's a compact, unassuming unit that weighs about 513 grams. While it's almost three times as heavy as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, its dimensions are pretty similar, and it's around 1.5x as thick as Apple's smartphone, which makes it pocketable if you're wearing a coat.<br/>
<br/>
The flame-retardant plastic case is black on the back and painted in metallic grey on one side and around the edges. It's soft to the touch, but its smoothness suggests it will scratch easily, which is why I keep it in the supplied draw-string velvety pouch when it's not in use. The included USB-C to USB-C cable is around 18 inches long, and also fits snugly inside.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/3ugreen-nexode-100w-power-bank.jpg" alt="" width="3691" height="2300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959119" /><br/>
On one side of the unit is a button that when pressed illuminates a simple LCD readout that tells you the percentage of charge left in its five 21700 battery cells, which together total 20,000mAh capacity. The power bank itself supports fast charging at a maximum 65W. With a charger that takes advantage of that, the unit reaches 50% capacity in about 50 minutes, and full capacity in about 110 minutes, so you can basically look at the LCD percentage readout to get a fairly good idea of how its progressing. The bank is also capable of charging your devices while being charged itself.<br/>
<br/>
On one side of the bank are three ports: The IN1/OUT1 is a USB-C port that's used to charge the Nexode, but it's also the connector to use if you want to charge a device at the maximum 100W output. Then there's secondary USB-C and USB-A ports, allowing you to charge up to three devices simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
I've been charging my M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> 13-inch using the maximum 100W fast charging speed, and from 10% battery it can bring my laptop up to a 50% charge in around 25 minutes, and fully charge it in about an hour, with around 10% of juice in the bank to spare. When I plug in my &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; when it's hovering around 10%, it hits 60% charge in half an hour, and fully charges in under an hour, with enough left in the power bank's tank to fully recharge the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> from almost dead more than twice over. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/7ugreen-nexode-100w-power-bank.jpg" alt="" width="5712" height="3597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959118" /><br/>
Those charge times, while swift, do depend on nothing else being connected to the power bank, because that's when the variable output changes. With more than one device plugged in, the 100W port is limited to 65W, which still isn't bad, but the wait time obviously goes up. On their own, the second USB-C port maxes out at 30W, while the USB-A port can handle 22.5W, both of which are good for AirPods or an Apple Watch (if both gadgets are connected, pressing the unit's button three times in succession activates a small-current mode). <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/2ugreen-nexode-100w-power-bank.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959120" /><br/>
That said, if all three ports are active, the two secondary ports share 20W, although that doesn't affect the 100W rate, which feels reasonable for a power bank on a single charge. Regardless, the overall capacity of the unit means that I've been able to work away from home all day without having to worry if I'll have access to a power outlet – even if my MacBook hasn't been charged to full overnight. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, heading out for a weekend away with a fully charged MacBook and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, it's easily met my needs, even when I've not had easy access to power. All in all, the Ugreen Nexode 100W hasn't let me down. There may be no bells and whistles to speak of, but that helps keep the price reasonable.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple no longer plans to use resin-coated copper for logic boards in iPhone 17 models next year, supply chain analyst <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1813561418316443713">Ming-Chi Kuo said today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iphone-15-a16-bionic.jpg" alt="" width="2030" height="1142" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912526" /><br/>
Kuo said resin-coated copper failed to meet Apple's "high-quality requirements," leading to the company scrapping its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/rcc-thinner-circuit-boards-2025/">plans to adopt the material for iPhone 17 models</a>. It is unclear if Apple will revisit resin-coated copper for iPhone 18 models or later, but it appears that the material is at least a few years away from being used in iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Resin-coated copper is a thin layer of copper foil coated with a resin, such as an epoxy. The material would allow for a thinner logic board, which in turn would provide more internal space for other components and sensors in future iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
It was also rumored that at least one new Apple Watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/next-apple-watch-thinner-logic-board-rumor/">would use resin-coated copper</a> this year, but it is unclear if that plan has been delayed too.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/17/kuo-iphone-17-wont-use-resin-coated-copper/">Kuo: Apple Delays Change Aimed at Saving Space Inside Future iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-delays-change-aimed-at-saving-space-inside-future-iphones.2431588/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in 2025 will take on a new compact camera module (CCM) supplier for future MacBook models powered by its next-generation M5 chip, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/New-MacBook-Pros-Launching-Tomorrow-With-These-4-New-Features-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921192" /><br/>
Writing in his latest investor note on <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/舜宇光學2025年營運動能可望顯著受益於成為apple新相機模組供應商與iphone訂單回流-sunny-opticals-2025-business-momentum-to-benefit-509819818c2a">Medium</a>, Kuo said Apple will turn to Sunny Optical for the CCM in its M5 MacBooks. The Chinese optical lens company will mass produce the CCMs in Vietnam, and provide a complete imaging system integrated into a compact form factor for the new laptops. <br/>
<br/>
The primary suppliers of camera modules for MacBooks are currently LG InnoTek and Sharp. In Apple's optical component supply chain, only Sunny Optical can simultaneously supply CCM and lenses in a single package, which gives the company the advantage of vertical integration. If shipments for the MacBooks go smoothly, Kuo predicts that Sunny Optical could also become the new CCM supplier for future iPhone and iPad models. <br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to update the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 chip as soon as late 2024, and we could perhaps see a refresh before the end of the year. The high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are also expected to see a late 2024 refresh with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/">thinner version of the MacBook Pro</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. The ultrathin 2024 iPad Pro serves as a model for Apple's upcoming design philosophy, with the company planning to offer "the thinnest and lightest products" in each category across the tech industry. <br/>
<br/>
It's not clear when a thinner MacBook Pro might come out, since no design changes are rumored for the 2024 refresh, but it's possible that 2025 could be the year that Apple debuts redesigned laptops based on its M5 chip. Apple is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/25/face-id-for-mac-couple-of-years/">rumored</a> to be working on Face ID for the Mac, and it's likely that the MacBook Pro will be one of the first Macs to get Face ID, but there are no concrete details about when that might happen.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/17/apple-camera-module-supplier-macbook-models-2025/">M5 MacBook Models to Use New Compact Camera Module in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m5-macbook-models-to-use-new-compact-camera-module-in-2025.2431570/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has made a macOS 15 Sequoia beta available for its public beta testing group, letting public beta testers try out the software before it launches this fall. Keep reading to learn whether you should install it on your Mac, and if so, how to go about it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-hero-240610.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954631" /><br/>
Signing up to get the macOS Sequoia beta is simple, and can be done by enrolling a Mac in Apple's free Apple Beta Software Program. The steps you need to complete to install the software on your device are provided towards the end of this article, but before you jump ahead, here are a few things worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Should I Install macOS Sequoia Public Beta?</h2><br/>
Before downloading the update, it's worth noting that Apple does not recommend installing the macOS Sequoia Beta on your main Mac, so if you have a secondary Mac that has no important data on it, use that. This is beta software, which means there are often bugs and issues that pop up that can prevent software from working properly or cause other problems. <br/>
<br/>
With that caveat in mind, the steps in the remainder of this article show you how to get the macOS 15 beta on your Mac. First though, check that you have a compatible Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Will macOS Sequoia run on My Mac?</h2><br/>
macOS 15 Sequoia works with the same Macs as macOS 14 Sonoma other than the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air. They include:<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>MacBook Air (2020 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>MacBook Pro (2018 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>iMac (2019 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>Mac Mini (2018 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>iMac Pro (2017 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>Mac Pro (2019 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>Mac Studio (2022 and later)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You can check your Mac's model by clicking the Apple in the menu bar and choosing About This Mac. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Don't Forget to Back Up Your Mac</h2><br/>
Be sure to back up your Mac using Time Machine before installing the software using the method, otherwise you won't be able to revert back to the previous version of macOS if things go wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Download macOS Sequoia Public Beta</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/apple-beta-software-program.jpg" alt="" width="2774" height="1494" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958873" /><ol><br/>
 	<li>On your Mac, open up Safari and navigate to the <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">Apple Beta Software Program website</a>.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap the <strong>Sign up</strong> button and enter your Apple ID credentials, or sign in with your Apple ID if you've signed up to beta test a previous update.</li><br/>
 	<li>Agree to the Apple Beta Software Program terms and conditions if required.</li><br/>
 	<li>After signing in, you'll see a main screen that's a Guide for Public Betas. Click on <strong>macOS</strong>.</li><br/>
 	<li>Read through Apple's instructions carefully, and then using the link in the "Get Started" section, select <strong>enroll your iOS device</strong>.</li><br/>
 	<li>Make sure to make an backup of your current version of macOS using Time Machine by following Apple's instructions. This will allow you to downgrade back to your earlier version of macOS if necessary and is crucial if you don't enjoy the macOS Sequoia testing experience.</li><br/>
<li>If your Mac is running macOS Ventura 13.4 or later, go to <strong>System Settings -> General -> Software Update</strong> and click the <strong>Info</strong> button next to "Beta updates." Then choose the macOS beta you'd like to install. If your Mac is running macOS Ventura 13.3 or earlier, download Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com/download/1016471">macOS Beta Access Utility</a> and run the installer. Then follow the onscreen instructions to complete installation. Note that your Mac must be signed in with the same Apple ID you used to enroll in the Apple Beta Software Program.</li></ol>Installation of the macOS beta is manually chosen in <strong>System Settings -> General -> Software Update</strong>. If a newly released beta is not available when you check, you will receive a notification when it is available to download.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>macOS Sequoia Features</h2><br/>
macOS Sequoia's standout feature is iPhone Mirroring, enabling you to control your iPhone from your Mac using your keyboard and mouse. This includes viewing notifications and using iPhone apps even when the device is tucked away and locked. Later this year, you'll also be able to drag and drop apps between your Mac and iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-iphone-mirroring.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956750" /><br/>
Window tiling has been enhanced for easier management of multiple windows. Safari now offers webpage summaries and highlights, while the Messages app supports message scheduling and Tapback reactions with any emoji. A new Passwords app simplifies managing passwords, logins, and passkeys. The Photos app has a redesigned interface, and the Notes app now includes audio transcription and summarization, along with automatic equation solving.<br/>
<br/>
macOS Sequoia incorporates all new Apple Intelligence features coming to iOS 18, providing various quality of life improvements. These include writing tools for proofreading and polishing your text across apps, the Image Playground for creating unique images, and Genmoji for designing custom emojis. The Photos app features a Clean Up tool for removing unwanted images, and Siri has improved AI for better language understanding and contextual relevance, even consulting ChatGPT for complex queries.<br/>
<br/>
Additional features are also coming to macOS Sequoia.

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple created a standalone Passwords app that streamlines login and password management. You've been able to store password information on your Apple devices through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain for years, but accessing passwords was a little difficult because the data was tucked away in the Settings app. That's no longer the case, and in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, it's much simpler to create and manage passwords for websites and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Generic-iOS-18-Passwords-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959050" /><br/>
This guide goes over everything you need to know about the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; Passwords app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2><br/>
The Passwords app is installed automatically when upgrading to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>. The app has a simple layout with a search bar right at the top, so you can look up the information that you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-passwords-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959069" /><br/>
If you've already used the &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Keychain feature, all of your saved logins and passwords will be ready to go as soon as you authenticate with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>. There are separate sections for passwords and logins (under All), Passkeys, two-factor authentication codes, Wi-Fi passwords, security warnings, and logins that have been deleted.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-passwords-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957056" /><br/>
You can tap in to any of the sections to see what's listed there, and tapping on an individual entry shows the login and password. Each entry has fields for site or app name, username, login, verification code, websites where the login is used, and notes. There's also a one-tap option for changing your password for any given entry.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-passwords-app-wifi.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959075" /><br/>
The layout of the Passwords app is similar to what you see in the Passwords section of the Settings app in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="adding_logins_and_passwords">Adding Logins and Passwords</h2><br/>
To add a login or password to the Passwords app, it's as simple as tapping on the "+" button at the bottom of the main interface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-add-password.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959071" /><br/>
The Passwords app populates a new entry with a password automatically, and you just need to add the website name and username, then copy the password and put it in the app, website, or service you're signing up for. Tapping on Save will save the information.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to add information to an existing entry, you can tap into the relevant section, such as All, search for the login you want to update, tap it, and then select the "Edit" option to get to the editing interface for adding notes, changing a password, or adding a verification code.<br/>
<br/>
Passwords and logins are added automatically to the Passwords app when you have &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Keychain enabled and you create a new login in Safari or in an app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="changing_passwords">Changing Passwords</h2><br/>
To change a Password, you just need to open up the Passwords app, search for the login you want to update, tap on Edit, and then tap on the "Change Password..." option. You can also browse through Passwords using the "All" section.<br/>
<br/>
Tapping on Change Password opens up the website associated with the login and password, but you will need to initiate the password change process on the site by logging into your account and finding the appropriate option for updating a password.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="deleting_passwords">Deleting Passwords</h2><br/>
To delete a password, go to the "All" section and browse until you find it, or search for a specific login. From the "All" overview, you can swipe from right to left to bring up a delete option. Just tap on delete to remove the password.<br/>
<br/>
You can also tap into any of your logins, choose Edit, and select Delete Password from there. To delete multiple logins, tap on the Select tool at the top right of the display (it looks like a list with a checkmark) and then tap any of the logins you want to delete. When you're done, tap on Delete again to delete them all.<br/>
<br/>
Passwords that you have deleted are stored in a Deleted folder in the Passwords app for 30 days before they're permanently deleted. You can tap into that folder and swipe to delete logins and passwords right away. Alternatively, you can use the select button at the top to delete multiple logins at one time.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="authentication_codes">Authentication Codes</h2><br/>
The Passwords app can provide two-factor authentication codes for sites that make additional security options available. To add a two-factor authentication code, tap on the "Codes" section of the main Passwords interface.<br/>
<br/>
From there, tap on the "+" button. You can either scan a QR code with a camera, which is a common way two-factor authentication apps work, or enter a setup key. Once the code is stored in the Passwords app, you can open up the Codes section at any time to get a temporary code to log in to a site or app.<br/>
<br/>
Two-factor authentication codes also show up when you search for a password and login or browse through logins in the "All" section.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="passkeys">Passkeys</h2><br/>
Websites have started transitioning from passwords to passkeys, and the Passwords app stores your passkeys as well as your logins and passwords.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-passwords-passkey.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959070" /><br/>
Passkeys are more secure than passwords, and they let you log into your accounts using &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; authentication on an Apple device. Passkeys basically use a cryptographic key pair, with one public key stored on a server and a private key stored on your device.<br/>
<br/>
Private keys are not shared, they remain on-device only, and can't be sent to other people, protecting your accounts from phishing attempts.<br/>
<br/>
You can see your stored passkeys in the Passkeys section of the Passwords app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="password_sharing">Password Sharing</h2><br/>
The Passwords app lets you set up and share select passwords with trusted contacts. You can create one or more groups of people that include family and friends, providing them with access to shared logins and passwords.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-passwords-shared-groups.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959072" /><br/>
Creating a group can be done by tapping on the folder on the left hand side of the main Passwords interface. Type in a name, and then select people to add. Note that anyone you add needs to be in your contacts list.<br/>
<br/>
From there, you can select logins and passwords that you want to share. Logins and passwords can be removed at any time, and all members of a group can contribute logins. The group creator can remove people from the group at any time.<br/>
<br/>
To share a password with someone in person, you can search for the login that you want to share and then use the Share Sheet to open up an AirDrop interface that will let you AirDrop the login and password information. The Share Sheet is only designed for this kind of in-person sharing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="autofill">AutoFill</h2><br/>
If you have AutoFill enabled on your devices, your logins and passwords will be entered automatically when you visit a website in Safari that you have stored login information for. AutoFill will pop up an option for the appropriate login and password on any account login field in Safari or in an app.<br/>
<br/>
AutoFill works the same as it did when passwords were limited to the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="sorting">Sorting</h2><br/>
In the "All" section of the Passwords app, you can tap on the icon that features two arrows to get to sorting options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-password-app-sorting.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959073" /><br/>
Sorting options include Date Edited, Date Created, Website, or Title, and each of these can be displayed in a Descending or Ascending list by tapping on the desired option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="syncing">Syncing</h2><br/>
Passwords are synced automatically between all of your Apple devices using &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Keychain. You just need to have the option turned on and you need to be logged in to your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> on any device where you want to access your passwords.<br/>
<br/>
You can even get to your logins and passwords on a Windows PC because Apple is adding the Passwords app to iTunes for Windows.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2><br/>
There is a dedicated Security section in the Passwords app, and it lets you know if you have a password that is reused, too weak, or has been compromised in a data leak.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-passwords-app-security.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959074" /><br/>
Warnings are accompanied by information letting you know that a password change is in order, and you can tap on the Change Password option to go to the website where you need to update your information.<br/>
<br/>
For any individual login, you'll also see information letting you know if your password is weak or strong.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="importing_passwords">Importing Passwords</h2><br/>
Apple plans to provide a tool for importing passwords from other services like 1Password and LastPass, but as of now, this functionality has not yet been implemented.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="read_more">Read More</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> app to introduce a more personalized For You experience, which offers up more relevant product and service suggestions along with more information on what you can do with your existing devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Apple-Store-App-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886114" /><br/>
The entire navigation bar has been refreshed, replacing Shop with Products and Sessions with Go Further. The For You tab provides relevant offers and suggestions such as free <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> trials, while the Products tab lets you see new products and also shop for accessories for your devices.<br/>
<br/>
The "Go Further" tab shows nearby Today at Apple sessions, provides help with device setup, and offers support for your devices. For these new changes, Apple has a new opt-in data collection feature. Apple says that it collects data about your shopping activity, subscriptions, and more to make suggestions, but there is an option to not provide this information to Apple.<blockquote>To create a personalised shopping experience, we'll collect and use data about your device, Apple account, Apple Store shopping activity and Apple subscriptions.<br/>
<br/>
Privacy is important, and we want to be clear about what we're collecting and how we will use it. You can modify these at any time in Account Settings.</blockquote><br/>
The updated version of the &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; app also includes a new Today at Apple video series with short videos that you can watch to get tips on device features.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's full release notes for the refreshed &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; app are below.<br/>
<blockquote><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>A fresh, more curated experience that makes it easier to quickly find the most relevant content on the For You tab, shop the latest on the Products tab, and make the most of the devices you already own on the Go Further tab.</li><br/>
 	<li>Check out the new video series from Today at Apple with featured guests that will inspire you to do more with your devices.</li><br/>
 	<li>New options to customize your privacy settings and preferences give you enhanced control over how Apple will use the data you share with us.</li><br/>

Sales tax holidays provide a limited-time opportunity to purchase select Apple products online or in stores without paying sales tax. Eligible products and price limits vary from state to state, with complete details <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/campaigns/tax-holiday">outlined on Apple's website</a>. Apple says tax savings may not appear during checkout, but will be reflected on the final receipt.<br/>
<br/>
The tax-free holidays run from July 19 through August 11, with the exact dates varying by state. Some other U.S states are offering tax-free holidays this summer, but they are not listed on Apple's website at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Sales tax holidays are especially beneficial to students, as the tax savings can be combined with Apple's ongoing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-back-to-schoo-promotion-launches/">Back to School promotion</a>, which offers students up to a &#36;150 Apple gift card with the purchase of an eligible Mac or iPad, as well as 20% off AppleCare+ plans. This is in addition to Apple's standard educational discounts on select products.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/apple-2024-sales-tax-free-holidays/">Apple Lists Products Eligible for Sales Tax-Free Holidays in 8 U.S. States</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-lists-products-eligible-for-sales-tax-free-holidays-in-8-u-s-states.2431511/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta.

<br/>
The features Apple promised for &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; have all been implemented, so it is not clear what will be included in iOS 17.6, and no major new additions have been discovered in the betas so far.<br/>

The &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.<br/>

Apple may make further improvements to Personas, EyeSight, and other features with &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.3, as well as implement additional bug fixes.

<br/>
tvOS software releases are usually minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.6.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/apple-seeds-tvos-17-6-beta-4-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of tvOS 17.6 to Developers [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-tvos-17-6-to-developers-update-public-beta-available.2431506/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<category>Apple Ads</category>
		<category>Apple Privacy</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a new privacy-focused Safari ad, which is designed to highlight the ways that Safari protects user privacy compared to other browsers.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0HjDpPnxcP0" title="Privacy on iPhone | Flock | Apple" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
In the spot, security cameras are positioned as pesky birds and bats, hovering around smartphone users as they browse the web. The cameras are everywhere, representing website trackers. Much of the ad is focused on non-iPhone users, but toward the end, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users opens up Safari and all the creepy cameras explode in mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
The video is accompanied by billboards in cities around the world and short digital ads that are being shown on social networks. Apple has also highlighted some of the recent privacy updates made to Safari <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/15697/private-browsing-2-0/">on its WebKit blog</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Safari has long protected advertisers from tracking users across the web with cross-site tracking, and it uses Intelligent Tracking Prevention to suss out and block domains collecting tracking data.<br/>
<br/>
IP addresses are hidden from known trackers in Safari, as this can be used to identify users across websites, plus location information is not shared without express user permission and with optional time limitations. To cut down on fingerprinting, a tracking technique that uses system configuration info, Safari provides limited information to trackers to make devices look more identical.<br/>
<br/>
The Safari Private Browsing mode offers an option to use a different search engine, it strips information added to URLs for tracking purposes, it has a content blocker to block network requests from known trackers, and it restricts web extensions that have access to webpage content and browsing history.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>+ subscribers have additional protections with &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay and Safari Private Browsing, including separate sessions for every tab so sites can't tell if two tabs came from the same device and a non-specific IP location based on country and time zone.<br/>
<br/>
Tracking preventions that Apple designed specifically for Private Browsing mode are enabled by default when in that mode, but they can also be enabled for regular browsing by going to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Safari &gt; Advanced &gt; Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and toggling on the "All Browsing" feature. On a Mac, the setting can be found under Safari &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, a number of Safari's protections are not offered by other browsers such as Chrome, which makes Safari the ideal choice for privacy. Safari's unique features include using machine learning to combat cross-site tracking, removing unique trackers from URLs in Private Browsing, hiding IP address from known trackers, preventing web extensions from seeing browsing by default, not sharing location data with search engine, and blocking known trackers in Private Browsing.<br/>
<br/>
More information on Safari's privacy protections can be found on <a href="https://apple.com/privacy">Apple's privacy website</a>, with specific technical information <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/15697/private-browsing-2-0/">available on the WebKit blog</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/">Apple Privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/apple-safari-ad-campaign/">Apple Launches New Safari Ad Campaign: &#039;A Browser That&#039;s Actually Private&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-new-safari-ad-campaign-a-browser-thats-actually-private.2431496/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2024/07/apple-and-metrolinx-introduce-presto-card-for-iphone-and-apple-watch/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.prestocard.ca/en/about/presto-in-mobile-wallet/apple">Metrolinx</a> today announced that the PRESTO card can <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/apple-pay/transit/toronto/">now be added to the Wallet app</a>, allowing commuters in Toronto, Canada and the surrounding area to tap an iPhone or Apple Watch to pay for a fare on buses, streetcars, trains, and the subway. Funds can be loaded onto the card directly in the Wallet app for added convenience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Wallet-PRESTO.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958998" /><br/>
Express Mode allows commuters to simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a payment reader to pay for their ride, without needing to unlock or wake the device. This mode even works for up to five hours after your iPhone runs out of battery power.<br/>
<br/>
Transit agencies that accept the PRESTO card in the Wallet app include the TTC and UP Express in Toronto, HSR in Hamilton, MiWay in Mississauga, Brampton Transit, Burlington Transit, Durham Region Transit, Oakville Transit, and York Region Transit, as well as the GO Transit network. The feature does not work with OC Transpo in Ottawa.<br/>
<br/>
To add the PRESTO card to the Wallet app, tap on the plus sign in the top-right corner, select Transit Card, and select PRESTO. A physical PRESTO card can also be converted for use in the Wallet app, but the physical card will no longer work. The version in the Wallet app supports various fare types, and Ontario's new One Fare program.<br/>
<br/>
Adding a PRESTO card to the Wallet app requires an iPhone 8 or later with iOS 16.4 or later, or an Apple Watch Series 4 or later with watchOS 9.4 or later.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is seemingly planning a rework of the Apple Watch lineup for 2024, according to a range of reports from over the past year. Here's everything we know so far. <br/>
<br/>

Apple is expected to continue to offer three different Apple Watch models in five casing sizes, but the various display sizes will allegedly grow by up to 12% and the casings will get taller. Based on all of the latest rumors, this is what we are expecting to change:<br/>

</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The first- and second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> models use the design of the Apple Watch Series 4, which was introduced in 2018. With the third generation, Apple is expected to update the SE to the design introduced with the Apple Watch Series 7 in 2021 for a more modern appearance with a larger screen and slimmer bezels.<br/>
<br/>
For Apple's main "Series" line of Apple Watches, the smallest casing size is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">discontinued</a>. The original Apple Watch and Series 1, 2, and 3 were available in a 38mm casing, and this grew to 40mm with the Series 4. With the Series 7, it grew further still to 41mm.<br/>
<br/>
This year, the larger of the two standard Apple Watch casing sizes, the 45mm model, is expected to become the smallest option. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">all-new 49mm casing size</a>, matching the current Apple Watch Ultra, is expected to be introduced as the new larger option. The 49mm Apple Watch Ultra is compatible with bands designed for the 45mm Apple Watch Series models, so it is possible that Apple Watch bands could be compatible across both Series 10 models and the Apple Watch Ultra for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
The design of the Apple Watch Series 10 is expected to be largely the same as that of the Series 9 and its other predecessors, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10/">leaked CAD renders</a>, meaning that the all-new 49mm model will be the most striking addition.<br/>
<br/>
DSCC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/07/microled-apple-watch-ultra-2025/">Ross Young</a>, Haitong International Securities's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/cheaper-airpods-and-micro-led-apple-watch-rumors/">Jeff Pu</a>, and Omdia's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/08/apple-watch-series-x-larger-display-rumor/">David Hsieh</a> have claimed that the next-generation Apple Watch Ultra will feature a larger 2.13-inch display, but it is worth noting that many of these reports related to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled-for-now/">now-canceled</a> introduction of a microLED display. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> says that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">no design changes</a> are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3, so the larger display size is far from certain and it could in reality have the same casing and display size as the current model.<br/>
<br/>
If the rumors pan out, all of the 2024 Apple Watch models will be larger than the models they replace in the lineup. New features for the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 include the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">S10 chip with AI enhancements</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/2024-apple-watch-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea/">hypertension detection, and sleep apnea detection</a>. The entire new Apple Watch lineup is expected to be announced in the fall as usual alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/2024-apple-watch-lineup-key-changes/">2024 Apple Watch Lineup: Key Changes We&#039;re Expecting</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2024-apple-watch-lineup-key-changes-were-expecting.2431492/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Smart home company Lutron today announced a few new additions to its <a href="https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/products/dimmers-switches">Caséta line of products</a>, expanding the range of lighting options available to consumers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lutron-smart-dimmer.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958804" /><br/>
For professional installers, there is now a Diva smart dimmer with ELV+ technology, offering smart control for low-voltage applications like under-cabinet lighting, track lights, and accent lights. The dimmer works with ELV devices and with nearly all residential lighting types and loads, such as LED, MLV, incandescent, and halogen.<br/>
<br/>
Like the Smart Dimmer Switch for ELV+ Lighting, the Diva version uses phase-selectable dimming to enable dimming across a range of load types. Installers can select between forward or reverse-phase dimming in the Lutron app or when installing the light.<br/>
<br/>
The Diva smart dimmer with ELV+ is available in white, ivory, light almond, black, brown, and gray to match other switches and outlets in the home.<br/>
<br/>
Lutron is also introducing new color options for the Pico Paddle Remote, which was previously only available in white. The Pico Paddle Remote now comes in white, ivory, light almond, black, brown, and gray, much like other Caséta accessories.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lutron-pico-paddle-colors.jpg" alt="" width="1112" height="623" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958805" /><br/>
The Pico Paddle Remote can control Caséta smart switches and dimmers and Serena smart shades and fans, adding extra control options for lights and smart home products. The Pico Paddle Remotes have a 10-year battery life and do not require a hub, app, or Wi-Fi for operation.<br/>
<br/>
The Diva smart dimmer ELV+ and new Pico Paddle Remote options <a href="https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/products/dimmers-switches">are available through</a> electrical distributors and online retailers that carry Caséta controls.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lutron/">Lutron</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/lutron-elv-diva-smart-dimmer/">Lutron Debuts New Diva Smart Dimmer With ELV+, Additional Pico Paddle Remote Colors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lutron-debuts-new-diva-smart-dimmer-with-elv-additional-pico-paddle-remote-colors.2431490/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
