		<description><![CDATA[Apple introduced a new design for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app that replaces the Library and For You sections with a more integrated all-in-one view, and part of that redesign includes an overhauled Utilities section that makes it easier to find different types of images.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-photos-utilities.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955074" /><br/>
Rather than being limited to Imports, Duplicates, Hidden, and Recently Deleted as in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, the Utilities section of the app has all of the following categories:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Hidden</li><br/>
 	<li>Recently Deleted</li><br/>
 	<li>Duplicates</li><br/>
 	<li>Receipts</li><br/>
 	<li>Handwriting</li><br/>
 	<li>Illustrations</li><br/>
 	<li>QR Codes</li><br/>
 	<li>Recently Saved</li><br/>
 	<li>Recently Viewed</li><br/>
 	<li>Recently Edited</li><br/>
 	<li>Documents</li><br/>
 	<li>Imports</li><br/>
 	<li>Maps</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You've been able to search for things like receipts in prior versions of iOS, and still can, but having them in a dedicated Utilities section makes them quicker to locate.<br/>
<br/>
Along with Utilities, the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app also features Media Types, and while this section is largely the same, there is a new Animated category. The Animated category and the Illustrations utility section may be aimed at the image generation tools that are coming to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; as part of the Apple Intelligence feature set.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also added a "Pinned Collections" section to &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, which houses things that you might want quick access to like Videos, Favorites, Screenshots, and Selfies. Collections are a repeat of content that can be found elsewhere in &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, but you can customize it to your liking so you see your preferred content at the top of the app. These changes to &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; are in iPadOS 18 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> as well as &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-photos-app-utilities/">iOS 18 Photos App Adds New Utilities Categories for Finding QR Codes, Receipts, Illustrations and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-photos-app-adds-new-utilities-categories-for-finding-qr-codes-receipts-illustrations-and-more.2428937/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 18&#039;s Battery Section Tells You If You Used a Slow Charger</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple updated the Battery section of the Settings app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> to add a feature that lets you know if you charged your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a "slow" charger.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-battery-slow-charging.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955071" /><br/>
Periods of slow charging are shown with an orange bar in the portion of the Battery settings that show battery usage and charging over the past 24 hours or the past 10 days.<br/>
<br/>
We saw the slow charging notice after charging with a 5W wireless charger, as did <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1ddhrju/ios_18_db1_warning_when_connected_to_a_slow/">a Redditor</a> who highlighted the feature. It's not clear what exactly is considered "slow," but the designation is useful for those who are seeing slow charging speeds and aren't sure why.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-slow-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1534" height="863" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955072" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Image via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1ddhrju/ios_18_db1_warning_when_connected_to_a_slow/">Reddit</a></div></em><br/>
Many wireless chargers claim to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> while being limited to Qi speeds or below, so this feature could help &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users understand why their devices aren't charging at optimum speed. There does not appear to be an option to enable an alert when charging from a slow charger, which could be an arguably better feature because the battery settings are somewhat hidden.<br/>
<br/>
There is a tappable information button that accompanies slow charging notices, but as of right now, it goes to a support document that does not yet exist.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-slow-charger-battery-settings/">iOS 18&#039;s Battery Section Tells You If You Used a Slow Charger</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18s-battery-section-tells-you-if-you-used-a-slow-charger.2428933/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iCloud Interface Gets Overhaul in iOS 18</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple revamped the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> section of the Apple Account (formerly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>) that's available in the Settings app. The redesigned interface has much of the same functionality, but a "Saved to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;" feature makes it clearer how storage is being used. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/icloud-redesign-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955068" /><br/>
Saved to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; replaces Apps Using &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, and it provides more information at a glance. Rather than just listing whether &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; is on for an app, you can see how much storage space Messages takes up, how many Notes are stored, how many <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> are in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Tapping into each section provides additional detail and tools for managing storage, much of which was available before. While the main interface no longer shows where the majority of &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; storage is going by file type, tapping the Storage bar shows the full breakdown and list of apps using the most storage. <br/>
<br/>
If you subscribe to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+, there's a new "Subscriber Edition" icon, which is similar to the icon that Apple uses for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a>+. &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ features can be listed and managed through the &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ section.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a more prominent "Recommended For You" suggestions interface that recommends things like deleting inactive backups, upgrading to a new &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ plan, and more, along with quicker access to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; backups.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/icloud-interface-overhaul-ios-18/">iCloud Interface Gets Overhaul in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/icloud-interface-gets-overhaul-in-ios-18.2428927/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since there was so much to take in at yesterday's WWDC keynote event, we thought we'd revisit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and highlight some of the most exciting features that Apple introduced. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Note that we've left out Apple Intelligence, which is what Apple is calling the AI features that it plans to add. Apple Intelligence will be limited to Apple's newest iPhones, but the features we've listed will be available on older iPhones, too.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> has a fun new Macintosh dynamic wallpaper and screensaver combination that highlights classic Mac icons. Basic Apple Guy shared some <a href="https://basicappleguy.com/haberdashery/macintoshwallpapers">high resolution screenshots</a> of the new wallpaper, which can be used on other Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-wallpaper.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955061" /><br/>
On device, the Macintosh wallpaper animates and shifts through different retro graphics, with color options that include Spectrum, Accent, Blue, Red, Purple, Yellow, Dark Gray, Gray, Green, Orange, and Random.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macintosh-wallpaper-macos-sequoia.jpg" alt="" width="1427" height="926" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955062" /><br/>
Macintosh isn't the only new &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; wallpaper, with Apple <a href="https://basicappleguy.com/haberdashery/sequoiawallpaper">also adding</a> "Helios," which is featured in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; marketing materials and Apple images. Helios animates with a gradient design.<br/>
<br/>
To see the wallpapers in their full glory, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; is required. The operating system update is available to developers right now, with a public release scheduled for the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/macos-sequoia-wallpaper/">macOS Sequoia Includes Wallpaper With Classic Mac Graphics</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-includes-wallpaper-with-classic-mac-graphics.2428921/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> will all have built-in "Apple Intelligence," and one of the new AI features includes an Image Playground. With Image Playground, you can generate an image from a prompt, similar to what you can do with OpenAI's ChatGPT. While you can come up with anything, Apple will provide a selection of suggested concepts in categories like themes, costumes, and places.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Image-Playground-Preset-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955046" /><br/>
Apple Intelligence isn't out yet, but &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; does provide some insight into the concepts that Apple will suggest to users, as <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://x.com/SteveMoser">Steve Moser</a> discovered. Apple's suggestions will be personalized, so if you're chatting with friends about going on a hike, you might see it pop up options like mountains and hiker. Note that this list is not exhaustive because it is missing some examples that are in Apple's marketing materials, but these are the options in the beta right now. Apple will also likely add new suggestions on an ongoing basis. <br/>

Image Playground is available as a standalone app, but it's also baked into apps like Notes and Messages. Images that are generated can include your contacts, and many of Apple's suggestions are tailored to that idea. Your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> can take a photo of a contact that's on your device and use it to generate a fun cartoon-like image that you can share with them.<br/>
<br/>
Apple adds a style to each image, and there's no option to generate something that looks real. There are three styles to choose from, including Animation, Illustration, and Sketch. Image generation is done on-device, so there's no limit on experimentation.<br/>
<br/>
In the Notes app, Image Playground has a neat added feature that allows it to take a quick sketch you've made and turn it in to something more detailed, plus it can add images based on the context provided in your notes.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Blackmagic Design has <a href="https://x.com/Blackmagic_News/status/1800273164867658228">announced</a> the Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive camera designed for shooting spatial video content for Apple's Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/blackmagic-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="4800" height="2700" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-955036" /><br/>
The URSA Cine Immersive camera features a custom stereoscopic 3D lens system with dual 8K sensors, capable of capturing a 180-degree field of view with spatial audio support. It is designed to capture content with a resolution of 8,160 x 7,200 per eye and offers 16 stops of dynamic range to ensure detail and color accuracy in every frame, with the ability to shoot stereoscopic 3D immersive cinema content at 90 frames per second.<br/>
<br/>
The URSA Cine Immersive is constructed with a magnesium alloy chassis and a carbon fiber polycarbonate composite skin. It includes dual 5-inch HDR touchscreens and an external color status LCD screen. Connectivity options are extensive, including 12G-SDI out, 10G Ethernet, USB-C, and XLR audio ports, along with an 8-pin Lemo connector for power.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive! New camera in development, designed to capture content for Apple Vision Pro with 8160 x 7200 resolution per eye, 16 stops of dynamic range for 90fps stereoscopic 3D immersive cinema content and more! Available later in 2024.

<br/>
An 8TB Blackmagic Media Module comes built-in, which can store around two hours of 8K stereoscopic video recorded in Blackmagic RAW. The camera also supports Cloud Store, allowing for fast media upload and synchronization via the 10G Ethernet connection. <br/>
<br/>
Simultaneously, Blackmagic Design is updating DaVinci Resolve to better support the creation of Vision Pro content. The updated editing software will feature a new immersive video viewer, allowing editors to pan, tilt, and roll clips for viewing on 2D monitors or directly on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset. <br/>
<br/>
Blackmagic has not yet announced the price of the URSA Cine Immersive camera. For reference, the Blackmagic URSA Cine 12K is priced at &#36;14,995 without a lens, suggesting that the new immersive camera could be similarly priced plus the cost of the twin lens system.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/blackmagic/">Blackmagic</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/blackmagic-design-unveils-spatial-video-camera/">Blackmagic Design Unveils Spatial Video Camera for Shooting Apple Vision Pro Content</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/blackmagic-design-unveils-spatial-video-camera-for-shooting-apple-vision-pro-content.2428893/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Notes app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and iPadOS 18 supports colors for typed text for the first time, providing an option to add new hues to text.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Notes-Highlight-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955030" /><br/>
Apple offers five colors, including purple, pink, orange, mint, and blue, and there is no option for custom colors. Colors can be added to text through the formatting interface that can be accessed by tapping on the Aa button, with the shade applied to any text that is selected. Both the text and the background turn the selected color when the feature is used.<br/>
<br/>
The five color options are useful for highlighting select words and passages in text. Multiple colors can be used in the same sentence, but it is worth noting that there does not seem to be an option for colored text without the shaded background, or black text with a colored background.<br/>
<br/>
Written text added to Notes on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> has supported multiple color options, but Apple has not made that a feature for typed text prior to now.<br/>
<br/>
Other features in the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; Notes app include live audio transcription and summarization, collapsible section headers, and the option to have Notes solve typed math problems (or written on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;).<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta is available to developers at the current time, with Apple planning to introduce a public beta in July.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-notes-app-colors/">iOS 18 Notes App Supports Colors for Highlighting Typed Text</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-notes-app-supports-colors-for-highlighting-typed-text.2428890/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has revamped the song queuing system in the Music app on iOS 18, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1dcx4o0/ios_18_db1_new_queue_system/">early reaction</a> to the changes has been overwhelmingly positive.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Music-Queue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955027" /><br/>
Notable changes include a new "Add Songs to Queue" button at the bottom of the queue, an option to clear the entire queue all at once, and the ability to change the currently playing song without having the queue disappear. In addition, the former "Play Last" menu option has been replaced with "Add to Queue." While listening to a playlist, it is now possible to add a song to the queue for immediate playback after the current song, whereas the song would previously get added to the end of the playlist.<br/>
<br/>
These changes bring Apple Music's queuing system on iPhone more in line with Spotify, and the Android version of the Apple Music app. It also brings Apple Music's queuing system more in line with how it worked back on iOS 9.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is currently available in beta for members of the Apple Developer Program, with a public beta to follow in July. The update should be widely released in September, allowing everyone to try out the new queuing system.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/apple-music-new-queue-system-ios-18/">Apple Music Features Improved Spotify-Like Queue System on iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-features-improved-spotify-like-queue-system-on-ios-18.2428883/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> includes a small but interesting change for the buttons on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, adding more of a visual element when changing volume, activating the Action button, or locking the screen. When you press an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; button in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, the display bezel bulges outward slightly.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-button-bulge.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954996" /><br/>
This feature is available for the volume buttons, Action button and the power button, and it will also likely be used for the Capture button that's rumored for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. With the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, Apple is adding a dedicated button to make it easier to film and take photos in landscape orientation. <br/>
<br/>
The button will be on the bottom right side of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, a good distance below the power button. Rumors suggest that the Capture button could be capacitive and flush with the side of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, so having the display pop out a bit when it's used would provide a useful visual indicator. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-id-to-apple-account-rebrand/">reported</a> that "Apple ID" would be renamed to "Apple Account," and this change has now been officially announced.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Apple-Account-Name-Feature-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954989" /><br/>
Apple confirmed the change in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/new-features-come-to-apple-services-this-fall/">press release</a> today, with "Apple Account" branding now used across iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and watchOS 11:<blockquote>With the releases of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and watchOS 11, Apple ID is renamed to Apple Account for a consistent sign-in experience across Apple services and devices, and relies on a user's existing credentials.</blockquote>There are still some places where Apple ID branding remains for now, such as the <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/">Apple ID sign-in page</a> on the web. The transition to "Apple Account" will likely be completed by time iOS 18 and the other software updates are publicly released later this year.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple Account" is certainly a more straightforward name, but "Apple ID" had been used for over two decades and had a lot of sentimental value.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-account/">Apple Account</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/apple-id-renamed-to-apple-account/">&#039;Apple ID&#039; Renamed to &#039;Apple Account&#039; Across iOS 18 and Other Updates</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-id-renamed-to-apple-account-across-ios-18-and-other-updates.2428857/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's stock price has crossed the &#36;200 mark and reached a new all-time high in intraday trading, one day after the company unveiled its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence suite of AI features</a> coming with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-Apple-Intelligence-hero-240610.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954530" /><br/>
Apple's stock price has split five times since the company went public, including on a 4-for-1 basis in 2020 most recently. This means that Apple's stock price would be over &#36;45,000 today if it had never been split, and all other things being equal.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI has been a hot topic ever since ChatGPT debuted in 2022, and investors had been waiting for Apple to unveil its own plans for the technology.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/aapl-vs-nvidia-3-trillion-dollar-companies/">Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple</a> to become the world's second most valuable company last week, amid strong demand for its AI server chips, but Apple has now regained second place with a &#36;3.1 trillion market cap as of writing. Apple now trails only Microsoft, which has a nearly &#36;3.2 trillion market cap as of writing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are not included in the first developer betas of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, but they will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-ios-18-beta/">available this summer</a>. Even when the features launch to the public later this year, they will still have a beta label. Read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">coverage of the Apple Intelligence announcement</a> to learn more about the new capabilities.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has shared updated <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/">iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 adoption figures</a>, revealing how many iPhones and iPads were running those software versions before WWDC.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Orange-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898582" /><br/>
These adoption numbers are based on iPhones and iPads that transacted on the App Store on June 9, the day before WWDC began, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The statistics are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>77% of all iPhones were updated to iOS 17.</li><br/>
<li>68% of all iPads were updated to iPadOS 17.</li><br/>
<li>86% of all iPhones introduced in the last four years were updated to iOS 17.</li><br/>
<li>77% of all iPads introduced in the last four years were updated to iPadOS 17.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
These will be the final iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 adoption figures given that Apple has since made the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-first-developer-betas-new-software/">first betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18</a> available to developers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple revealed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/01/apple-shares-ios-16-adoption-statistics/">81% of all iPhones were updated to iOS 16 as of May 30 last year</a>, so iOS 17 adoption peaking at 77% of all iPhones as of a later June 9 date this year means that iOS 17 adoption was not quite as high as iOS 16.<br/>
<br/>
All attention now turns to iOS 18, which will be publicly released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-adoption/">iOS Adoption</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/apple-shares-final-ios-17-adoption-stats/">Apple Reveals How Many iPhones Were Running iOS 17 Before WWDC</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reveals-how-many-iphones-were-running-ios-17-before-wwdc.2428847/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the first beta of iOS 18 now in the hands of developers, there are a handful of smaller changes and quality-of-life improvements being discovered in Apple's iPhone software that are worth highlighting. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/flashlight-interface.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954907" /><br/>
First up, Apple has improved the flashlight controls. In iOS 18, turning on the Flashlight via the Lock Screen or Control Center now brings up a small interface that lets you adjust the flood of light from the LED. In other words, you now have granular control over not only the intensity of light, but also the breadth of illumination.<br/>
<br/>
In the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-introduces-standalone-passwords-app/">new Passwords app</a>, you can generate QR codes for saved Wi-Fi passwords, allowing them to be shared more easily with others. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/passwords-app-wi-fi-qr-code.jpg" alt="" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954909" /><br/>
In the Settings app, usually you scroll down to get to settings for individual apps installed on your iPhone. In the iOS 18 beta, Apple has moved settings for apps to a separate screen, so now you tap "Apps" at the bottom of the menu to access a separate searchable list.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/settings-app-menu.jpg" alt="" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954908" /><br/>
In the redesigned Control Center, which now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-ios-18-control-center-multiple-screens/">extends to multiple screens</a>, tapping a new + icon in the top-left corner (or long-pressing on an empty area) reveals minus icons that let you remove individual buttons, similar to how you remove apps from the Home Screen, and there's a new Add a Control option at the bottom. There are also anchors that let you resize buttons or cards like the media player. So if you've always wanted to make the Shazam icon a 4x4 button, for example, now you can. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/control-center-edit-mode.jpg" alt="" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954911" /><br/>
Apple in iOS 18 has also added a new Power button to the top-right corner of the Control Center, so you don't have to physically hold the Side button to bring up the "Slide to power off" screen.<br/>
<br/>
In the Weather app, you can show forecasts for separate Home and Work locations. The new Home and Work labels can be toggled in Settings ➝ Apps ➝ Weather, under a new "Locations" section. Home and work locations can be updated by editing your Contacts card.<br/>
<br/>

The first developer beta of iOS 18 is now available, with a public beta following in July.

		<description><![CDATA[In addition to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-imessage-features/">text effects</a> and scheduled messages, iOS 18 adds a small but helpful change to iMessage: link card previews for more types of content.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Link-Card-in-Message-Preview-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954883" /><em>Screenshot: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a></em></div><br/>
<br/>
When you paste a link for a social media post into the text field in the Messages app, the associated link card now appears before you send the message, whereas it previously only became visible after the message was sent.<br/>
<br/>
It was already possible to see a link card preview before sending a message in some situations on iOS 17 and earlier, such as when sharing a website link directly from the Safari app or other browsers. The expansion of link card previews to more types of content, and to links pasted directly in the Messages app, is a nice improvement.<br/>
<br/>
The first developer beta of iOS 18 is available now, and a public beta will follow in July. The update should be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-imessage-link-card-previews/">iMessage on iOS 18 Previews Link Cards for Social Media Posts and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/imessage-on-ios-18-previews-link-cards-for-social-media-posts-and-more.2428824/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As part of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence</a> feature set, Apple on Monday announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow Siri to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/siri-can-access-chatgpt-with-ios-18/">access ChatGPT directly</a> in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia to provide better responses in relevant situations. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/google-gemini.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941761" /><br/>
In conversation with reporters after the WWDC keynote, Apple's senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi revealed that as Apple Intelligence evolves, the company eventually wants to give its users a choice between different AI models, and suggested that Google Gemini could be an option in the future. <br/>
<br/>
"We think ultimately people are going to have a preference for certain models they want to use, maybe one that's great for creative writing or one that they prefer for coding," said Federighi. "Maybe Google Gemini in the future. I mean, nothing to announce right now, but that's our direction."<br/>
<br/>
Federighi said that Apple's decision to start with ChatGPT was because the company wanted to "start with the best." ‌Siri‌ will leverage GPT-4o for free, with no need to create an account.

		<description><![CDATA[During its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-recap/">WWDC 2024 keynote</a> on Monday, Apple introduced a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-calculator-ipad-apple-pencil/">Calculator app for iPad</a> that includes a new Math Notes feature, and there are similar changes to be found in the Calculator app in iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/calculator-app-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954866" /><br/>
The Calculator app on iPhone now has an additional button to switch between Basic, Scientific, and Math Notes in portrait or landscape view. Meanwhile, there's a useful new History feature that helps you keep track of previous calculations. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, a new Convert option supports unit conversions for length, weight, currencies, and more. Here's the full conversions that are supported:<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>Angle</li><br/>
  <li>Area</li><br/>
  <li>Currency</li><br/>
  <li>Data</li><br/>
  <li>Energy</li><br/>
  <li>Force</li><br/>
  <li>Fuel</li><br/>
  <li>Length</li><br/>
  <li>Power</li><br/>
  <li>Pressure</li><br/>
  <li>Speed</li><br/>
  <li>Temperature</li><br/>
  <li>Time</li><br/>
  <li>Volume</li><br/>
  <li>Weight</li><br/>
</ul>In iPadOS 18, the new Calculator app lets users type or write out mathematical expressions with an Apple Pencil and see them solved in their own handwriting. These Math Notes are automatically accessible in the Notes app in a new Math Notes folder that can be accessed on both iPhone and iPad.<br/>
<br/>
The first developer beta of iPadOS 18 is now available, with a public beta following in July, and official release to the public in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-calculator-these-conversions/">iOS 18: Overhauled Calculator App Supports These 15 Conversions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-overhauled-calculator-app-supports-these-15-conversions.2428807/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Among the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-recap/">slew of iOS 18 updates announced</a> during Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> keynote, the company revealed a new way of paying for things with Apple Cash, called Tap to Cash.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tap-to-cash-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954862" /><br/>
As the name suggests, Tap to Cash lets users pay for things simply by tapping two iPhones together. The feature is reminiscent of NameDrop, where users can exchange contacts by tapping their devices together.<br/>
<br/>
Tap to Cash is an extension of Apple's Tap to Pay feature, and uses the same NFC functionality. Apple says that Tap to Cash allows users to transfer money without sharing any personal information, ensuring privacy is maintained.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also announced a few updates coming to Apple Wallet with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, including support for displaying information about rewards cards, such as points and redeemable gifts. Tickets for events will also gain better integration with the Wallet app, allowing users to see concert seat numbers, shortcuts for directions, and other information about events.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-cash/">Tap to Cash</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/tap-to-cash-ios-18-pay-touch-iphones/">Tap to Cash in iOS 18 Lets You Pay by Touching iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tap-to-cash-in-ios-18-lets-you-pay-by-touching-iphones.2428803/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As part of its Home Screen customization overhaul, iOS 18 lets iPhone users hide the labels on app icons for a cleaner look.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/hide-app-labels-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954851" /><br/>
Turning off the labels causes the icons to expand and take up the space where the text usually appears underneath. Here's how it currently works in the iOS 18 Developer Beta.<br/>
<ol><li>On the Home Screen, press and hold on an empty area.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the top-left corner.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Customize</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>In the customization menu that appears, tap the <strong>Large</strong> button.</li><br/>
<li>Tap anywhere on the Home Screen to save your preference.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/hide-app-labels-home-screen-ios-18.jpg" alt="Home Screen" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954852" /><br/>
<br/>
As things stand, it's not possible to hide labels and keep app icons small, but this could change in succeeding beta versions.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to hiding app labels, other new Home Screen customization options in iOS 18 include the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-home-screen/">place app icons anywhere, and a dark tint option</a> for app icons.<br/>
