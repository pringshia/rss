"Apple Vision Pro is so simple to navigate using your eyes, hands, and voice," says Apple. "It's like you already know how to use it."<br/>

Apple also shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-support-videos/">support videos</a> with overviews of the Settings app, Control Center, Guest Mode, accessibility features, and more on visionOS.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for a new all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7J5Z3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;737.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;799.00. This deal is only available in the Indigo Alpine Loop (Medium) configuration, and only Amazon has this deal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-and-Ultra-2-Deals-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913210" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
If you have your eye on other models, there are quite a few more deals on the Apple Watch Ultra 2 at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX94FRH%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;749.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;799.00. This is still a solid second-best price on the wearable, and you'll find it in the Trail Loop and Alpine Loop band styles.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7J5Z3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;61 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;737.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch deals are abundant on Amazon this week, and you can also get the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXCXKPD%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.00</strong></a> and the 44mm GPS model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5W8YM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;229.00</strong></a>, both of which are &#36;50 off and great second-best prices. Likewise, you can get the 41mm GPS Apple Watch Series 9 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX1RVMT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;329.00</strong></a> and the 45mm GPS model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX6SF1J%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;359.00</strong></a>, which are both &#36;70 off and also second-best prices.<br/>
<br/>
As of last month, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/">sales ban was reenacted</a> in the United States on any Apple Watch model sold by Apple that has blood oxygen sensing. While Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models purchased directly from Apple currently come with blood oxygen sensing disabled, retailers like Amazon are able to continue selling through their existing stocks that include the feature.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that Vision Pro demo appointments at Apple Stores in the U.S. on Monday and later <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/instore-shopping-session/?topic=visionpro">can be reserved on Apple.com</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Demo.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933882" /><br/>
To reserve a free Vision Pro demo online, go to <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/instore-shopping-session/?topic=visionpro">this page</a> on Apple's website and follow the steps to book an appointment at your local Apple Store. It is also possible to make a reservation through the latest version of the Apple Store app. Apple will ask you a few questions to get started, including whether you wear prescription eyeglasses or contacts, in order to prepare ZEISS optical inserts for your demo if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, Vision Pro demos are available from today through Sunday at all Apple Stores in the U.S. on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no way to reserve a demo on these days, so you simply need to show up and wait.<br/>
<br/>
"Be one of the first to get a demo of Apple Vision Pro," reads a new banner added to Apple's website today. "We invite you to sign up for a demo at your local Apple Store. Demo times are available on a first-come, first-served basis. For demos on February 5 or later, you can also book an appointment online."<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro demos will take up to 30 minutes each, including setup time. During the demo, you will learn how to navigate the visionOS operating system, and explore built-in apps such as Apple TV, Photos, and Safari.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-demo-reservations/">Apple Vision Pro Demos on Monday and Later Can Be Reserved Online</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-demos-on-monday-and-later-can-be-reserved-online.2418148/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Juno App Brings YouTube to Apple Vision Pro Because Google Won&#039;t</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Developer <a href="https://christianselig.com">Christian Selig</a> of "Apollo for Reddit" fame has created what Google wouldn't – a dedicated YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
 <img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/juno-youtube.jpeg" alt="" width="2732" height="1868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934029" /><br/>
Called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/juno-for-youtube/id6476961640">Juno for YouTube</a>, the app lets Vision Pro owners browse the YouTube platform in a cleanly refined visionOS interface without having to resort to the lackluster alternative, which is visiting the YouTube website in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
The video player includes native controls for interacting with the video, including resizing to create a home theater experience in your living room, repositioning, dimming your room around the video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, there's support for aspect ratio detection, and buttons to increase or decrease playback speed, toggle captions, and share videos. As you'd expect from a third-party app, no YouTube account is required to use Juno, and it won't auto-skip ads, but YouTube Premium subscribers will enjoy the benefits that accompany the tier through the app.<br/>
<br/>
Selig cautions that early adopters of the app may encounter a few bugs, since he has only been able to develop and interact with it in the Vision Pro simulator. But that's unlikely to concern users who are familiar with the developer's reputation and engagement with people who use his apps. Plus, he's getting a Vision Pro headset today.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And here&#39;s a quick overview video showing it in action. I&#39;m looking forward to trying it on an actual device tomorrow, I really feel like Apple Vision Pro is going to make such an amazing YouTube experience &#x1f973; <a href="https://t.co/GY39eDF7bC">pic.twitter.com/GY39eDF7bC</a></p>&mdash; Christian Selig (@ChristianSelig) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig/status/1753266682175390110?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
YouTube said earlier this month that it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/youtube-spotify-vision-pro/">not developing a YouTube Vision Pro app</a>, nor will it allow the YouTube iPad app to run on the device. Netflix and Spotify have said the same thing. Netflix and Spotify will instead be accessible through Safari, similar to YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/juno-for-youtube/id6476961640">Juno for YouTube</a> is priced at &#36;4.99 and the app is already available on the App Store for nascent Vision Pro owners to check out.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/">YouTube</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/juno-app-youtube-apple-vision-pro/">Juno App Brings YouTube to Apple Vision Pro Because Google Won&#039;t</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/juno-app-brings-youtube-to-apple-vision-pro-because-google-wont.2418146/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple's first-ever mixed reality headset offers both augmented and virtual reality features, and it is controlled with a combination of your eyes, hands, and voice. Apple describes the device as a "spatial computer" instead of a headset.<br/>
<br/>
"The era of spatial computing has arrived," said Apple CEO Tim Cook. "Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Independent record labels have expressed concerns about Apple's plans to pay more money for songs recorded in Spatial Audio, claiming it will only benefit the biggest companies in the marketplace, reports the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dc5a6ef2-acc6-456f-830a-84baad7c3db0">Financial Times</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>

Last week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-music-more-royalties-spatial-audio/">announced</a> royalty incentives to encourage music artists and record labels to publish tracks in Spatial Audio. Apple said it will pay up to 10% more in royalties for Spatial Audio, which uses Dolby Atmos technology to replicate an in-person music experience with sound coming from various directions around the listener. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/16/apple-music-spatial-audio-lossless-interview/">said</a> that over half of Apple Music subscribers use the feature, and that the bonus is a reward for artists delivering the content, and also compensation to recognize the additional time and effort required to mix in Dolby Atmos.<br/>
<br/>
However, several independent labels told <em>FT</em> that the new incentive will effectively channel cash towards established megastars and away from other musicians who do not have the resources to compete. <br/>
<blockquote>"It's literally going to take the money out of independent labels and their artists, to benefit the biggest companies in the marketplace," said a senior executive at a large independent record company.<br/>
<br/>
"It's going to benefit the biggest player, Universal, because they're the ones with the resources to invest in that. Whereas the independent sector . . . we've found it hard to justify the expense of creating spatial masters . . . we're not in the business of chucking money just because Apple is saying you should be spending money on this."</blockquote>Another independent label told <em>FT</em> that the new deal will badly impact its revenues. <br/>
<br/>
Producing music in Spatial Audio is not cheap. Executives say it costs an extra &#36;1,000 per song, or roughly &#36;10,000 per album, and going back to remaster older tracks can double the costs. Some record executives have also questioned the artistic value of Spatial Audio, with one executive likening it to "hanging a digital 3D version of the 'Mona Lisa' and expecting Louvre patrons to prefer it." <br/>
<br/>
Indie labels say they hope to work with Apple to make changes to the new policy. If those negotiations fail, they would explore legal or regulatory options, said people familiar with the matter who spoke to <em>FT</em>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ft-com/">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-music-spatial-audio-royalties-big-companies/">Apple Music Spatial Audio Royalties Only Benefit the Biggest Companies, Say Indie Record Labels</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-spatial-audio-royalties-only-benefit-the-biggest-companies-say-indie-record-labels.2418141/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has criticized Apple's compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulation, which forces Apple to let third-party developers create alternative App Stores and use their own payment systems, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">amongst other things</a>.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Speaking to investors on Thursday during Meta's Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg called Apple's new rules "so onerous" that he would not be surprised if any developer adopted them.<br/>
<blockquote>"I don't think that the Apple thing is going to have any difference for us. Because I think that the way they have implemented it, I would be very surprised if any developer chose to go into the alternative app stores that they have. They've made it so onerous, and I think so at odds with the intent of what the EU regulation was, that I think it's just going to be very difficult for anyone, including ourselves, to really seriously entertain what they're doing there."</blockquote>The introduction of the EU's DMA regulations were designed to increase competition in the bloc's app economy by allowing other companies to host their own app stores and collect payments, without them being subjected to Apple's commission rates. However, Apple has introduced a new fee structure as part of the change, including a €0.50 "<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/">Core Technology Fee</a>" or CTF for every app install over one million installs, a model that could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-eu-fees-could-bankrupt-app-developers/">prohibitively expensive for free apps</a> like Meta's if they are distributed outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Meta's comments broadly align with several other big companies critical of Apple's proposed DMA changes, including Spotify, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, Mozilla, and Microsoft. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/spotify-on-apple-eu-app-changes/">Spotify CEO Daniel EK</a> called Apple's plan "a complete and total farce" under "the false pretense of compliance and concessions." <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/fortnite-returning-to-ios-in-europe/">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney</a>, another outspoken Apple critic, said that the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌ changes are a "devious new instance of malicious compliance" aimed at thwarting EU regulations. Microsoft <a href="https://twitter.com/bondsarah_bond/status/1752083596318593238">said</a> they are a "step in the wrong direction," while Mozilla said it was "extremely disappointed" and called the plans "another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true browser competition on iOS."   <br/>
<br/>
EU regulators say they intend to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/technology/apple-app-store-europe.html">study Apple's proposed plans</a> after March 7, when the DMA goes into effect.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/zuckerberg-criticizes-apple-dma-plans/">Zuckerberg Calls Apple&#039;s DMA Compliance Changes &#039;Onerous&#039; and &#039;Difficult to Seriously Entertain&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/zuckerberg-calls-apples-dma-compliance-changes-onerous-and-difficult-to-seriously-entertain.2418139/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Cultured Code</a> has officially released an all-new spatial computing version of Things 3, the popular personal task manager software, for Apple's Vision Pro headset, which launches today in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Things-3-for-Vision-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933502" /><br/>
Developed from the ground up to be a fully featured native app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the productivity app brings the familiar Things interface into the user's virtual workspace, allowing them to open multiple Things windows and arrange them around their immediate environment.<br/>
<br/>
The sidebar can be hidden to focus on a single list, or users can place it next to their other apps while they get things done. As you'd expect for a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; app, the Things interface can be navigated using eyes, hands, and voice. Available functions include the ability to search across lists, drag and drop to-dos, and dictate notes.<br/>
<br/>
The app also works with a wireless keyboard connection, offering full keyboard support, and Things for Vision Pro syncs with the app on Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and Apple Watch.<br/>

		<title>Apple to Launch Foldable As Early As 2026 That Could Ultimately Replace iPad Mini</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is considering launching its first foldable in the next few years in the form of a 7- to 8-inch device that could ultimately replace the 8.3-inch iPad mini.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/FoldPad-Redux-24-Magenta-and-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934078" /><br/>
That's the latest claim to come out of Korean outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25724">The Elec</a></em>. According to the report, Apple is reviewing a launch timeframe for the device between 2026 and 2027.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple is also actively developing an OLED iPad mini, so there remains uncertainty within Apple about the nature and specifications of the foldable. Speculation reportedly remains rife in the industry around whether it will be a foldable iPhone or foldable iPad model.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung Display and LG Display have reportedly already been sending samples of 7-inch and 8-inch foldable panels to Apple since last year.<br/>
<br/>
Among the panel companies, Samsung is said to be more active in developing Apple foldable panels than LG, and is the more likely primary supplier of a foldable panel if Apple decides on a 2026 release. <br/>
<br/>
Apple, Samsung Display, and LG Display are also said to have "different ideas" about the ultra-thin glass material, foldable panel cover window, and the hinge concept, which is at the core of the product's mechanism. These differences reportedly involve contrasting judgements concerning product durability and reliability.<br/>
<br/>
Once mass production is decided, Samsung is expected to create the foldable panel in the 6th generation A3 or A4 OLED line that it uses to make OLED panels for Apple's iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report, Apple is also working on a larger 20.5-inch foldable product that is expected to be released later than the 7- to 8-inch device. The larger foldable has been rumored before by both <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-20-inch-display-future-macbook-pro/">The Elec</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Bloomberg</a></em>, and Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/25/bigger-ipad-pro-could-be-foldable/">Ross Young</a>. Young has also previously said that he expects a foldable tablet-like device in 2026 or 2027.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/">Apple to Launch Foldable As Early As 2026 That Could Ultimately Replace iPad Mini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-foldable-as-early-as-2026-that-could-ultimately-replace-ipad-mini.2418134/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held its earnings call for the first fiscal quarter of 2024 (fourth calendar quarter of 2023), with Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Apple CFO Luca Maestri sharing details on Apple's performance, recent product sales, services growth, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834994" /><br/>
We've highlighted the most interesting takeaways from the earnings call.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>EU App Ecosystem Changes</h2><br/>
Maestri and Cook were asked about possible economic results from the changes that are being made to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> in the European Union. Maestri said that the EU represents just seven percent of Apple's global &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; revenue, while Cook said that impact it is impossible to determine right now because Apple finds it difficult to predict what customers and developers will choose.<br/>
<br/>
"We've really focused on privacy, security and usability," Cook said. "And we've we've tried our best to get as close it in the past in terms of things that people love about our ecosystem, but we're going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply because we need to comply with the with the regulation."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro</h2><br/>
Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that several big companies are planning Vision Pro apps for customers and employees, including Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP. "From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come," said Maestri.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple is "incredibly excited about the enterprise opportunities" with Vision Pro. Walmart, for, example, has a "very cool" merchandising app. There are companies making collaboration and design apps, there are field service applications, apps for control center/command center work, and more. "Really all over the map," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
"We couldn't be more excited about where things are right now," Cook said. "This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple and really took a whole of company effort to bring it this far."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AI</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">Tim Cook said</a> that Apple is spending a "tremendous" amount of time and effort on artificial intelligence, and that details on its AI work will be shared later this year.<br/>
<blockquote>In terms of generative AI which I would guess is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally, as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so we're going to hold that to this as well. but we've got some things that we're incredibly excited about, that we'll be talking about later this year.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Services</h2><br/>
Apple's Services category set an all-time revenue record at &#36;23.1 billion, up from &#36;20.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Paid subscriptions grew double digits year-over-year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple set all-time revenue records in advertising cloud services, and payment services and video, along with December quarter records in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wearables</h2><br/>
The Wearables, Home and Accessories category saw a drop in revenue, coming in at &#36;12 billion, down from &#36;13.4 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac and iPad Sales</h2><br/>
Mac sales were about flat at &#36;7.8 billion (compared to &#36;7.7 billion last year), but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales were way down as Apple released no new models in 2023. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue was &#36;7 billion, down from &#36;9.4 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Active Devices</h2><br/>
Apple now has more than <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-2-2-billion-active-devices/">2.2 billion active devices</a> worldwide, which includes iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-q1-2024-earnings-tidbits/">Apple&#039;s Q1 2024 Earnings Call Takeaways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-q1-2024-earnings-call-takeaways.2418103/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Rumors suggest that Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> software release might be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/ios-18-biggest-update/">"biggest" software update</a> in the history of the device, with multiple AI features rumored.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be working on generative AI technology that will improve <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, the Messages app, and more. AI could be integrated across the operating system, in apps like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, Pages, Xcode, and more.<br/>
<br/>

For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of &#36;119.6 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;33.9 billion, or &#36;2.18 per diluted share, compared to revenue of &#36;117.2 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;30.0 billion, or &#36;1.88 per diluted share, in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/02/apple-1q-2023-earnings/">year-ago quarter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gross margin for the quarter was 45.9 percent, compared to 43.0 percent in the year-ago quarter.

"We are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments.

<br/>
<b>2:14 pm</b>: "In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at &#36;12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14 week last year."<br/>

<br/>
<b>2:20 pm</b>: "Revenue for the December quarter was &#36;119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. In the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter, and second. we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a two percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:20 pm</b>: "We set all-time revenue records in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:21 pm</b>: "Products revenue was &#36;96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, offset by challenging compares for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and wearables home and accessories, and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:21 pm</b>: "Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments and is now over 2.2 billion active devices."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:22 pm</b>: "Services revenue set an all time record of &#36;23.1 billion, up 11% year over year when we take into account the extra week last year. This represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We're very pleased with our services performance in both developed and emerging markets."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:23 pm</b>: "Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Product gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leveraging mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:24 pm</b>: "Operating expenses of &#36;14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided. Net income was &#36;33.9 billion, up 3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was &#36;2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all time record, and operating cash flow was very strong at &#36;39.9 billion."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:24 pm</b>: "Our &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; active installed base grew to a new all time high and we had an all time record number of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving the new &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; family with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the US. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, many &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Cantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the US and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:26 pm</b>: "Mac generated revenue of &#36;7.8 billion and returned to growth despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter and we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the US."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:26 pm</b>: "&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; was &#36;7 billion in revenue, down 25% year over year. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 10 generation and we had an extra week of sales. However, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; install base continues to grow and is at an all time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; was recently measured at 98% in the US."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:28 pm</b>: "Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was &#36;12 billion, down 11% year over year due to a challenging compare and the extra week a year ago. <br/>
<br/>
... <br/>
<br/>
We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple watch during the quarter were new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the US and in services. We were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. <br/>
<br/>
Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services; both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high... We had well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:30 pm</b>: He discusses enterprise use of Macs, but also shares interest from companies in the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
"We are seeing strong excitement in enterprise, with leading organizations across many industries such as WalMart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg and SAP interested in leveraging and investing in &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; as a new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to the customers and employees. <br/>
<br/>
From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:30 pm</b>: "We ended the quarter with &#36;173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by &#36;4 billion, leaving us with total debt of &#36;108 billion. As a result, net cash was &#36;65 billion at the end of the quarter. And our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly &#36;27 billion to shareholders, including &#36;3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and &#36;20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:31 pm</b>: "We expect both our March quarter total company revenue and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our services business, we expect a similar double digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46 and 47%. We expect our CapEx to be between &#36;14.3 and &#36;14.5 billion we expect OINE to be around &#36;50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: Can you unpack some of the services drivers a bit for us? How we should think about services growth for the March quarter, and then speak to some of those underlying drivers in the December quarter, and then the March quarter?<br/>
<br/>
A:  Let's start with the December quarter. Up 11% to &#36;23.1 billion is an all-time record for us with all-time records in the Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pac, so it was pretty broad base geographically and very strong across all the services categories. Obviously, last year we had an extra week, so the 11% is stronger than the underlying performance that we have reported.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: A: Very significant growth there. What I said during the prepared remarks around the the March quarter, I mentioned that we will continue to grow double digits at a percentage that is similar to what we reported for the December quarter; we don't provide guidance around the different services category, so we will provide more color when we report in three months."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:35 pm</b>: Q: Could you share a bit more detail about the new users you will you were able to onboard over the last 12 months, meaning how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts, either in terms of geographic representation, or skew to certain products or even how their monetization differ from past cohorts?<br/>
<br/>
A: I would say emerging markets have been a very key area of strength for us. India grew in revenue terms by very strong double digits in the December quarter and hit a quarter revenue record. The other emerging markets, like Indonesia, also had a quarterly record, and we had several regions with records from Latin America to the Middle East. And that theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters of the year as well, so emerging markets very very important. And I feel like we're doing a great job there.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:37 pm</b>: Q: First on services, just on the outlook for the March quarter for a similar double-digit growth rate as of the December quarter. I'm just wondering, why not? Why wouldn't it be potentially faster given that the December quarter obviously had a headwind from the extra week comp and some of the pricing uplifts on select <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> services that were implemented last winter should should help in the March quarter. <br/>
<br/>
A: FX was essentially flat in the December quarter so you have a bit of a headwind there, and then when you look at the progression of our services business over the last few quarters, the compares for March are slightly more difficult than compares for December.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:39 pm</b>: Q: It was very interesting to hear about some of the enterprise customer investments into Vision Pro. Could you talk about some of the efforts to support the Vision Pro developer ecosystem, and it was also good to hear about the potential upcoming announcements on AI.<br/>
<br/>
A: We are incredibly excited about the enterprise opportunities with &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. I've seen several demos from different companies, Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks, but Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. <br/>
<br/>
There are firms that are doing collaboration, design apps. There are field service applications. Really all over the map. There are applications that for control center / command center kind of things. SAP has really gotten behind it, and of course SAP is in so many companies that I think there will be a great opportunity for us and enterprise. We couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across apple and really took a whole of company effort to bring it this far.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of generative AI which I would guess is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally, as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so we're going to hold that to this as well. but we've got some things that we're incredibly excited about, that we'll be talking about later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:41 pm</b>: Q: Asking about the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; upgrade cycle and what they saw in December.<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, since the announcement and shipment in September, and you compare that to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> over the same period of time, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; is outselling &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;. Upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:44 pm</b>: Q: How would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time and which Apple product's adoption curve would you look at us potentially the most similar?<br/>
<br/>
A: So each product has its own journey and so I wouldn't want to compare it to any one in particular, I would just say we couldn't be more excited. <br/>
<br/>
Internally, we've gotten a incredible amount of excitement from developers and from customers that can't wait till tomorrow to pick up their units. <br/>
<br/>
And we're incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the US starting tomorrow for people that want to check it out. And so we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that that you're familiar with.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5000 patents in the product and it's built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on from, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning. All the hand tracking, the room mapping, all this stuff is driven by AI. And so we're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in a store tomorrow and and see the reaction.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:45 pm</b>: Q: I was hoping to talk a little bit about what are you seeing in China right now? I think from a geographic basis, it's one of the few places that was down double digits while everything else was going up slowly. What do you see now from a competition perspective and a demand perspective in China?<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in China mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest, and you look at it in constant currency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. And so it was the other things that drove the larger contraction year over year. On the good news side, we had solid growth on upgraders year over year in mainland China and we had four of the top six smartphone models in urban China.<br/>
<br/>
Also, IDC just put out a note that you may have seen where we were the top brand for the full year and for the December quarter. And so there's some good news.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:48 pm</b>: Q: Changes in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in Europe. Do you see it having any significant impact financially to your services or the broader Apple P&L statement.<br/>
<br/>
A: We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March. <br/>
<br/>
So the last month of the calendar quarter, the second fiscal quarter. Some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores or marketplaces, if you will. We're also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps.<br/>
<br/>
We've really focused on privacy, security and usability. And we've we've tried our best to get as close it in the past in terms of things that people love about our ecosystem, but we're going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply because we need to comply with the with the regulation. A lot will depend on the choices customers make. <br/>
<br/>
Just to keep it in context, the changes apply to the EU market which represents roughly 7% of our global &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; revenue.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:50 pm</b>: Q: How are you thinking about the component pricing environment as we think about that gross margin into the March quarter and looking forward?<br/>
<br/>
A: Our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points. So a very significant increase. I would say the two primary components of the increase are a favorable mix, we did very well with our high-end models and leverage. It's the biggest quarter of the year for us and so we get the leverage effect.<br/>
<br/>
We had a partial offset on negative impact from foreign exchange, but net obviously, very significant improvement and we had very similar dynamics on the services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also, in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so the combined effect of the two businesses gave us the 45.9 at the total company level.<br/>
<br/>
We are guiding total company gross margin to 46 to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:52 pm</b>: Q: Your capital expenditures have actually come down this last year. As you look to lean in to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to to make investments and set the table for a generative AI platform as we move forward? Just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies.<br/>
<br/>
A: We've always said we will never under-invest in the business, so we are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, and services development. We will continue to invest in every area of the business and at the appropriate level. <br/>
And we're very excited about what's in store for us for the rest of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:54 pm</b>: Q: Asking about impacts to the March quarter, and the compare to last year.<br/>
<br/>
A: Last year, we had this disruption of supply on &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and Pro Max because all the factories shut down due to the COVID 19 situation. And so essentially there was pent up demand as we exited the December quarter they got fulfilled, and we also did the channel fill associated with it during the March quarter, so the close to &#36;5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
On gross margin, good expansion over the last few quarters and now we are guiding to 46 to 47% and that takes into account everything that is going on in the commodity environment and the foreign exchange situation. Obviously, the product and services mix and the outcome of this is the guidance result.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:56 pm</b>: Q:  It's very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise, and, historically, Apple has been a consumer-centric company. And now Mac, it's penetrating more into the enterprise. I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future. Would it still be consumer-centric or do you think it's going to be more enterprise-focused also, as we get into the future?<br/>
<br/>
A: We've really concluded that we can do both. If you look at it what has happened over the last several years, employees are are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology. And so it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision making. That is a huge advantage for Apple, because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well. <br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro, when you look at it, the ton of use cases. I mean, we're starting with a million apps and 600 plus that are have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of enterprise in a long time. So I think, like there is for the Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and of course &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has been in enterprise since since the early days of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:59 pm</b>: Q: How do you think about the differences in macro conditions by region? Do you have a sense of are we nearing the trough from a macro demand perspective? Or how long do you think this particular weakness persists?<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at the US, which obviously drives the vast majority of the revenue, in the Americas, we grew in the December quarter from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; business point of view, and the install base hit an all-time high. If you look at the replacement cycle, it's very difficult to measure the replacement cycle at any given point. And so what we focus on internally a lot is the active installed base. And obviously the sales are usually a cycle. We feel better about about those things.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, the extra week that we had a year ago makes the compare more distorted on the March quarter guide. I would point out to you that the COVID years had a lot of turmoil, a lot of volatility that typically you wouldn't see. If you look at our sequential progression from December to March this year, versus pre-COVID versus a more normal environment, it's actually stronger than those years.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3:00 pm</b>: Q: Just wanted to clarify on China. Are you still upbeat about the opportunity and growth there?<br/>
<br/>
A: We've been in China for 30 years and I remain very optimistic about China over the long term. I feel good about hitting a new install base number, a high watermark, and very good about the growth in upgraders year over year and during the quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3:01 pm</b>: Q: Are you a believer in the thesis that AI and processing on smartphones and devices like yours is going to have a huge role in AI and AI apps, and that's something you guys can take advantage of?<br/>
<br/>
A: Let me just say that I think there's a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The Vision Pro is set to come out tomorrow, and Apple has already released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2/">visionOS 1.0.2 update</a>, which means there will be a day-one update that Vision Pro owners need to install.<br/>
<br/>

<em>CNET</em>'s Scott Stein today shared a video that demonstrates what the Vision Pro looks like when an update is installed. While the update is in progress, there's a bar on the front display that slowly fills up as the update is installed, and when it's done, an Apple logo is shown during a restart.<br/>
<br/>

Starting tomorrow at 8 a.m. local time, all Apple Stores in the U.S. will allow customers to receive a Vision Pro demo, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/apple-store-vision-pro-demos-details/">expected to last around 20 to 25 minutes</a>.

Demos on Monday and later <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-demo-reservations/">can be reserved online</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the Vision Pro starts at &#36;3,499, these free demos will be especially important for customers who want to experience spatial computing without spending a fortune. During the demo, they will learn how to navigate the visionOS operating system, and explore built-in apps such as Apple TV, Photos, and Safari.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/vision-pro-apple-store-demos/">Vision Pro Demos Begin Tomorrow at All U.S. Apple Stores</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-demos-begin-tomorrow-at-all-u-s-apple-stores.2418088/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Meta Quest VR headset will soon be able to play spatial videos captured on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/v62-software-update-spatial-video-playback-gamepad-support-browswer/">Meta announced today</a>. The upcoming v62 update will add support for the feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/meta-quest-spatial-video.png" alt="" width="780" height="439" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933969" /><br/>
Spatial videos can be uploaded to the Meta Quest headset using the Meta Quest mobile app, so that the stereoscopic videos captured on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models can be relived on Meta's device for those who do not have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Spatial videos uploaded to the Meta Quest will be converted to the correct format for playback on the device, and it will be stored in the cloud. Spatial video content can be selected from the Files menu for an immersive viewing experience. Several demo videos are available on the Meta Quest so users can experience what spatial videos are like.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added the ability to capture spatial videos specifically for &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; headset owners. On Apple devices, spatial videos can only be viewed on the Vision Pro headset, which is priced at &#36;3,500. Other products show the spatial videos as standard 2D videos.<br/>
<blockquote>We are thrilled to announce support for spatial video playback on Meta Quest! If you have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can now upload spatial videos (a.k.a stereoscopic videos) to your Meta Quest headset using the Meta Quest mobile app--letting you relive the moment with surprising depth. With this new feature, you can experience your memories and media content like never before.</blockquote><br/>
At &#36;500, the Meta Quest is more affordable than the Vision Pro, so the option to watch spatial videos on a lower-cost device might be appealing to some &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; owners.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/meta-quest-spatial-videos/">Meta&#039;s VR Headset Can Play iPhone Spatial Videos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/metas-vr-headset-can-play-iphone-spatial-videos.2418087/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For a few months in 2022, Snapchat parent company Snap sold <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/28/snap-pixy-drone/">a Pixy selfie camera drone</a>. Sales of the device were lackluster and Snap stopped all plans for further work on the device after a four month period. Still, Snap sold 71,000 of the devices, but now it's <a href="https://support.pixy.com/hc/en-us">recalling all of them</a>.<br/>
<br/>

As noted by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24058119/snap-recall-pixy-drone-refund">The Verge</a></em>, the batteries in the Pixy are a fire hazard and Snap has <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/Snap-Recalls-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Sold-for-Pixy-Flying-Cameras-Due-to-Fire-Hazard">issued a recall</a> in partnership with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Pixy's battery can overheat, and there have been four reports of battery issues. One incident resulted in a minor battery fire, and a second resulted in a minor injury.<br/>
<br/>
The Pixy was sold on Snapchat's Pixy website and on Amazon between May 2022 and December 2023, with prices ranging from &#36;185 to &#36;250. Snap also sold extra batteries for &#36;16 to &#36;20.<br/>
<br/>
According to the recall notice, customers who purchased a Pixy Flying Camera should remove the battery and stop charging it. Snap is providing refunds for all customers who bought a Pixy.<br/>
<br/>
To get a refund, customers will need to <a href="https://support.pixy.com/hc/en-us">visit the Pixy support site</a> and follow the instructions.

This iPad features a 10.2-inch Retina Display, 12MP front camera and 8MP rear camera, the A13 Bionic chip, and Touch ID. This is the most affordable iPad that Apple sells, and when it's discounted it's an even better deal.<br/>
