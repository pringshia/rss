		<description><![CDATA[This weekend, we're tracking a new sale at Samsung with savings on the company's best smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, and laptops. These discounts are part of Samsung's larger <a href="https://howl.me/clM8jtwNoQg">Discover Samsung Spring Sale</a>, which we started covering last week with deals on monitors, storage, audio, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/samsung-hero-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940340" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/discover-samsung-massive-discount/">best monitor deal from our original post</a> is still live today: you can get the ViewFinity S9 5K Smart Monitor for <a href="https://howl.me/clLNLtD8GuF"><strong>&#36;899.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.99. At &#36;700 off this a very solid second-best price on the 2023 display, which has a matte display, modular 4K SlimFit camera, and support for Thunderbolt 4.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, when you <a href="https://howl.me/clM4GKBZeXm">sign up to learn more</a> about Samsung's upcoming TV and audio product lineup, you can get &#36;100 off your purchase. The new slate of Samsung TVs and audio equipment is set to be unveiled on March 21, and this &#36;100 discount offer will be available through that date.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smartphones</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/samsung-galaxy-s24.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940345" /><br/>
Samsung's newest smartphones launched back in January and you can get <a href="https://howl.me/clM7Wp8lyTV">some pretty big discounts</a> on the devices right now. Most of these offers do require you to trade in an existing smartphone and will be applied as credits on your bill, and Samsung covers discounts from carriers including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and US Cellular.<br/>
<br/>

In terms of smartwatches, Samsung has the <a href="https://howl.me/clM72xyoRru">Galaxy Watch6 and the Watch5 on sale</a>, with up to &#36;400 in savings. You can get these smartwatches with a straight cash discount, or opt for a cellular plan and gain access to more savings with an eligible trade-in.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clM7XLzEMwt"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO &#36;400 OFF</div>Galaxy Watch6 Classic with Rugged Sport Band</div></a></div><br/>

Similar to the Galaxy smartphones, Samsung is offering discounts on both cellular and Wi-Fi models of the Galaxy Tab line. If you go with the Wi-Fi models, you can get about &#36;100 off the base price of Galaxy Tab S9 Series, depending on the model.<br/>
<br/>
If you opt for the cellular devices from participating carriers, you can get more in savings in the form of bill credits after eligible trade-ins.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clM735jtNlD"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO &#36;1,120 OFF</div>Galaxy Tab S9 with Book Cover Keyboard Slim</div></a></div><br/>

Samsung has a few laptop deals with solid discounts shared below, but it's worth again noting that if you have a device to trade in you can get even bigger markdowns on these computers. For the Galaxy Book 4, Samsung is also offering a free 2TB portable SSD (&#36;219.99 value) with purchase of select models.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clM8biIOrzQ"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;220 OFF</div>Galaxy Book4 360 for &#36;1,099.99</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">announced</a> new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models, the first Mac updates of the year featuring M3 series chips. But there are other Macs in Apple's lineup still to be updated to the latest M3 processors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-Mac-Pro-Studio-Mini-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2138" height="1202" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940283" /><br/>
So, where do the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro fit into Apple's M3 roadmap for the year ahead? Here's what the latest rumors say.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Mini</h2><br/>
Apple announced ‌M2‌ and ‌M2‌ Pro Mac mini models in January 2023, which at the time of writing is over 400 days ago. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Mini-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920522" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said in July that he believes a new Mac mini won't emerge <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">until late 2024 at the earliest</a>, and we haven't heard any other rumors that move the dial since then. On the other hand, Apple may choose not to upgrade the Mac mini this year and skip the M3 entirely. Approximately 26 months passed between the launch of the M1 Mac mini and the update to the M2 Mac mini​​. Going forward, perhaps the company has an 18-month upgrade cycle in mind, which would mean we could see an M4 Mac mini in the spring of 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Studio</h2><br/>
Apple updated the ‌Mac Studio with ‌M2‌ series chips in June 2023. ‌Mac Studio‌ models come with either the ‌M2‌ Max or ‌M2‌ Ultra chip, so logic would suggest we should expect equivalent M3 variants.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-Mac-Studio-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2271" height="1278" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940094" /><br/>
However, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/05/m3-ultra-mac-studio-to-launch-in-mid-2024/">January</a> report by Taiwanese research firm TrendForce, a new Mac Studio model will launch in mid-2024 with a more powerful M3 Ultra chip than we might otherwise expect.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report, the M3 Ultra chip will be fabricated with TSMC's N3E node, just like the A18 chip that is expected to debut in the iPhone 16 lineup later this year. This means it would be Apple's first N3E chip. N3E is an enhanced version of TSMC's 3nm process, offering slightly better performance and higher production yield.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of days after the TrendForce report, Gurman said he believes Apple is working on a new Mac Studio that is likely to be offered with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/apple-working-on-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro/">as-yet-unannounced fourth variant of the M3 chip</a>. This will, like previous generations, double the components of the "Max" version, meaning that it will feature up to 32 CPU cores and 80 GPU cores. Gurman says that it is likely to launch in the second half of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Pro</h2><br/>
Along with the Mac Studio, Apple updated the Mac Pro with ‌M2‌ series chips during WWDC in June 2023. The ‌Mac Pro‌ is only available in a single chip configuration, and currently ships with the ‌M2‌ Ultra chip that's used in the Mac Studio.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-Mac-Pro-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2271" height="1278" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940090" /><br/>
Logically then, we should expect the next ‌Mac Pro‌ to receive an update to add the same M3 Ultra chip alongside the ‌Mac Studio‌, just like it received the ‌M2‌ Ultra chip last year. Like previous generations, this will likely double the components of the "Max" version, meaning that it will feature up to 32 CPU cores and 80 GPU cores.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, Gurman thinks Apple is likely to refresh the Mac Pro with this new high-end chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/apple-working-on-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro/">second half of the year</a>. Notably, he does not believe that Apple is likely to again abandon the machine after only one year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Pro – Already Updated</h2><br/>
Apple in November 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">updated its MacBook Pro lineup</a> with M3 and M3 Pro chips, so the company's work is already done in that regard.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/New-MacBook-Pros-Launching-Tomorrow-With-These-4-New-Features-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921192" /><br/>
Apple has so far adopted an 18-month cycle of M1 to M2, and M2 to M3, so it would be reasonable to assume a 2025 launch for M4 MacBook Pro models if Apple sticks with the same tempo. Incidentally, such a roadmap tallies with rumors of the first MacBook Pro with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/touchscreen-macs-report/">OLED display and possibly even a touchscreen</a>. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/09/m3-macs-still-expected-2024/">Here Are All the M3 Macs Still Expected This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-the-m3-macs-still-expected-this-year.2421520/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The cheapest MacBook Air deal you'll find this weekend at Best Buy is on the now-discontinued 256GB 13-inch M1 MacBook Air for <a href="https://howl.me/clALl0A1vd6"><strong>&#36;749.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;999.00. If you want a model with a larger display, the 256GB M2 15-inch MacBook Air is priced at <a href="https://howl.me/clwvUhPbHPL"><strong>&#36;999.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,299.00. You can also get the 512GB M2 model on sale at <a href="https://howl.me/clwvVizVdRk"><strong>&#36;1,199.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,499.00. Across the board these are the best prices we've ever seen on the M1 and M2 MacBook Air.<br/>

Unlike the MacBook Air deals, Best Buy's MacBook Pro sales all require a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership in order to see the all-time low prices. If you don't have one, you can still get solid second-best prices on these computers at Best Buy this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
These deals are focused on the 14-inch models of the MacBook Pro, but you can also find a few <a href="https://howl.me/clM5Hb55ftx">16-inch M3 MacBook Pro deals</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The base model 13-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM has significantly faster SSD speeds compared to the equivalent model with the M2 chip, according to benchmark results <a href="https://youtu.be/4U9nCMV7cv4">shared today by YouTube channel Max Tech</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-2-up-hero-240304-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939443" /><br/>
Max Tech's teardown video confirms that Apple has returned to using two 128GB storage chips for the new 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage, compared to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/14/m2-macbook-air-slower-ssd-base-model/">single 256GB chip in the equivalent model with the M2 chip</a>. This change results in faster SSD read and write speeds in tests, as the two chips can process requests in parallel.<br/>
<br/>
Max Tech ran Blackmagic's Disk Speed Test tool with a 5GB file size test on both the M2 and M3 models of the 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, and they found the SSD in the M3 model achieved up to 33% faster write speeds and up to 82% faster read speeds compared to the SSD in the M2 model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4U9nCMV7cv4?si=NjlaHMazuY6enVyM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The change very likely extends to the base model 15-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip, although Max Tech has yet to tear down that model.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to switch to a single 256GB chip for the base model MacBook Air in 2022 was controversial, even though the slower SSD speeds are unlikely to be noticed by the average MacBook Air user working on common day-to-day tasks. Nevertheless, customers who purchase an M3 model no longer need to worry about configuring the laptop with at least 512GB of storage in order to avoid the slower speeds.<br/>
<br/>

The new MacBook Air models with the M3 chip launched Friday. Apple continues to sell a 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip and 256GB of storage for &#36;999, so customers who want maximum SSD performance should avoid that model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/09/base-model-m3-macbook-air-faster-ssd/">Base Model M3 MacBook Air Has Faster SSD Speeds After Controversy With Previous Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/base-model-m3-macbook-air-has-faster-ssd-speeds-after-controversy-with-previous-model.2421496/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We heard some last-minute rumblings that an Apple product launch might be coming this week, and indeed it did with the debut of new MacBook Air models based on Apple's M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/top-stories-9mar2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940395" /><br/>
Alongside the new MacBook Air, we got the usual spring refresh with new Apple Watch band and iPhone case colors, while this week also saw the release of iOS 17.4 and related operating system updates, so read on below for details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces New MacBook Air Models With M3 Chip</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">updated the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air with several new features</a>, including the M3 chip for faster performance, Wi-Fi 6E support, expanded external display support, an anti-fingerprint seal on the Midnight finish, and microphone improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-2-up-hero-240304-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939443" /><br/>
The new MacBook Air models became available to order immediately after the announcement on Monday, with a launch following on Friday, March 8. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-discontinues-m1-macbook-air/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M1 chip</a> and the 15-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip as part of this refresh, while the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip now starts at &#36;999 in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
The first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/m3-macbook-air/">reviews and unboxing videos for the new MacBook Air</a> were published just ahead of the launch, and we've gone hands-on with the machine ourselves for some early impressions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>14-Inch MacBook Pro With M3 Chip to Get Multi-Display Support With Software Update</h2><br/>
The new MacBook Air models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-two-displays-lid-closed/">support two external displays when the laptop's lid is closed</a>. Previous models were officially limited to one external display, although DisplayLink adapters allow for more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/m3-macbook-pro-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940256" /><br/>
Apple has confirmed that the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-pro-multi-display-support/">also gain support for up to two external displays with a software update</a>. As with the MacBook Air, the laptop's lid will need to be closed to use a second display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases iOS 17.4 With EU App Changes, New Emoji, Podcast Transcripts, and More</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/apple-releases-ios-17-4/">released iOS 17.4 for the iPhone</a> following over a month of beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
iOS 17.4 include major App Store, Safari, and Apple Pay changes in the EU, as a result of the Digital Markets Act. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/apple-releases-ios-17-4/">Other key new features</a> include Apple Podcasts transcripts, an iMessage security upgrade, new emoji, and Apple Cash virtual card numbers. The update also further prepares for the launch of next-generation CarPlay this year.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the week, Apple released macOS Sonoma 14.4, watchOS 10.4, tvOS 17.4, HomePod software 17.4, and visionOS 1.1.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Refreshes iPhone Case and Apple Watch Band Colors</h2><br/>
As it does on a seasonal basis, Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-refreshes-cases-and-watch-bands/">updated some of the colors available for select iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/3-4-24-iPhone-Case-Refresh-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939420" /><br/>
For example, Apple's Silicone Case with MagSafe for ‌iPhone‌ is now available in new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-refreshes-cases-and-watch-bands/">Soft Mint, Sunshine, Light Blue, and Pink</a> color options.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to announce a new color option for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and it's unclear if it has any plans to.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>EU Fines Apple &#36;2 Billion for Anti-Competitive Behavior Toward Spotify</h2><br/>
The European Commission this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">levied a significant fine of nearly &#36;2 billion against Apple</a> due to alleged anti-competitive behavior towards Spotify.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
In response, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">Apple said</a> EU officials failed to "uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm," and said its decision "ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast."<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/spotify-lauds-2-billion-eu-fine-says-apple-has-muzzled-streaming-music-services/">Spotify said</a> the decision "marks an important moment in the fight for a more open internet for consumers."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple to Let EU iPhone Users Delete Safari and More Easily Transition to Android</h2><br/>
Apple already introduced several changes to the App Store and more on iOS 17.4 in the EU, in response to the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/transfer-to-android.jpg" alt="" width="1240" height="698" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940141" /><br/>
Now, Apple has shared additional plans. For example, the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-eu-safari-android-changes/">will allow iPhone users in the EU to delete the Safari app</a> and to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-eu-safari-android-changes/">more easily transition from an iPhone to an Android smartphone</a>. More specific details about these plans will be released at a later time.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is still months away from being unveiled, but there are already several rumors and expectations for the software update, as outlined below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-inspired generative AI features for Siri and many built-in apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also rumored to have some design changes, but details remain slim.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and widely released in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smarter Siri and Generative AI</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, according to sources such as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly teased that the company is working on generative AI, and plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a><br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other text prompts. The company has also expanded into generative AI tools for images and videos.<br/>
<br/>
Some generative AI features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">might be exclusive to iPhone 16 models</a>, which are rumored to have a Neural Engine with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" more cores</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design Changes</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-Design-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940300" /><br/>
In a February edition of his newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was working to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">update the design of iOS</a> as "early as this year."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has yet to reveal any specific design changes planned for iOS. In a November edition of his newsletter, however, he said Apple's senior management described iOS 18 as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">ambitious and compelling</a>," with "major new features and designs."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does not expect iOS 18 to receive a "total overhaul that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">mirrors visionOS</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Accessibility Features</h2><br/>
iOS 18 could include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/">new accessibility features related to VoiceOver, Live Speech, and Text Size</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models are in stores as of today, so we picked one up to test it out, see what's new, answer reader questions, and determine whether it's worth buying or upgrading to.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qI_HH9zBEEo" title="Apple M3 MacBook Air: Your Questions Answered!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is available in 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch sizes, just like the prior-generation versions. Apple did not introduce notable design changes this time around, so most of what's new is on the inside.<br/>
<br/>
An M3 chip is the main upgrade, and this is the same chip that Apple already used in the 14-inch MacBook Pro. When we benchmarked our test unit with an 8-core GPU and 10-core GPU, we got a Geekbench single-core score of 3106 and a multi-core score of 11690. For comparison's sake, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; scored 2335/8314 and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; scored 2595/9745, so that's a decent boost in CPU performance.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the &zwnj;M1&zwnj;, single-core M3 performance is up 28 percent, and multi-core performance is up 34 percent. Compared to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, both the single-core and multi-core CPU tests came in at 18 percent higher. As for Metal GPU scores, the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; earned a score of 32117, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; was at 45651, and the M3 was at 46920.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, CPU and GPU performance have improved notably over the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and more modestly over the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;. It's worth noting that the M3 also has hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading that are of use for 3D rendering and will eventually make games on the Mac more realistic. AV1 decode should improve streaming from services that support the codec.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of other improvements to note, including Wi-Fi 6E support for connecting to 6GHz networks. You might not see too many 6GHz networks just yet, but it's a good future proofing feature if you don't already have a 6E router. The M3 models support two external displays in clamshell mode rather than just one, call clarity is better than before, and there's a new finish on the midnight model to cut down on fingerprints.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;1099 and pricing on the 15-inch model starts at &#36;1299. It's not worth upgrading to the new machine if you already have an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; because those machines already have the 2022/2023 design, but if you have an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; or any Intel model and are looking for a new solution, the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of upgrades, if you're just using the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for day-to-day tasks like web browsing and email, you don't need to shell out extra money for more memory, a better GPU (13-inch model), or more storage, but if you plan to use it for more system intensive tasks, it's worth looking at some of those upgrades.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today reversed a decision to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/apple-explains-terminating-epic-games-account/">shut down Epic Games' developer account</a> in the European Union, and the account has now been reinstated. In a statement to <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> has committed to following the rules, allowing Epic Sweden to be reaccepted into the Apple Developer Program.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite-apple-logo-2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-755952" /><br/>
<blockquote>Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies. As a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program.</blockquote><br/>
When Apple terminated the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Sweden developer account earlier this week, it effectively prevented &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; from developing an alternative app marketplace for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the European Union. Apple claimed that the account had been terminated because &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; had previously breached its contractual obligations, and that the court decision in the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; v. Apple legal battle gave it the right to shut down any &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; account at any time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/">Phil Schiller</a> <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account">engaged in a conversation</a> with &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; CEO Tim Sweeney where he asked Sweeney for written assurance that &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; would adhere to the new rules for alternative app marketplaces, but Apple did not feel that Sweeney's response was thorough enough. Apple claimed that Epic is "verifiably untrustworthy," with the Cupertino company also citing negative comments from Tim Sweeney about Apple's Digital Marketplace Act (DMA) compliance.<br/>
<br/>
There was immediate public blowback from Apple's decision to kill the account, especially because the emails from Apple made it look like the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; account was terminated because of Sweeney's criticism. From Schiller's email:<br/>
<blockquote>In the past, Epic has entered into agreements with Apple and then broken them. For example, you testified that Epic Games, Inc. entered into the Developer Program with full understanding of its terms, and then chose to intentionally breach the agreement with Apple. You also testified that Epic deliberately violated Apple's rules, to make a point and forfinancial gain. More recently, you have described our DMA compliance plan as "hot garbage," a "horror show," and a "devious new instance of Malicious Compliance." And you have complained about what you called "Junk Fees" and "Apple taxes."<br/>
<br/>
Your colorful criticism of our DMA compliance plan, coupled with Epic's past practice of intentionally violating contractual provisions with which it disagrees, strongly suggest that Epic Sweden does not intend to follow the rules.</blockquote><br/>
The European Union <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/eu-probes-apple-termination-epic-account/">quickly stepped in</a> and asked Apple for "further explanations" on why it had shut down the EU &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; developer account, a move that likely led Apple to reconsider its decision. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; in a statement to <em>MacRumors</em> said that Apple's response demonstrates that the European Commission plans to act swiftly to enforce the DMA, and that the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; store is coming to Europe.<br/>
<blockquote>Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account. This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable. We are moving forward as planned to launch the Epic Games Store and bring Fortnite back to iOS in Europe. Onward!</blockquote><br/>
&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; announced plans for an alternative app marketplace shortly after Apple introduced support for alternative app stores in the iOS 17.4 beta. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; has pledged to bring Fortnite and other games to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; through its own dedicated storefront, but specific timing for the launch of the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store for iOS has not yet been provided.<br/>
<br/>
Though &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; is working on an alternative app marketplace, the company has criticized Apple's compliance with the DMA. Sweeney has called Apple's plan a "devious new instance of Malicious Compliance" and has said that &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; will continue to "argue to the courts and regulators that Apple is breaking the law."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortnite/">Fortnite</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/apple-reinstates-epic-games-developer-account-eu/">Apple Reinstates Epic Games EU Developer Account, Paving the Way for Alternative App Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reinstates-epic-games-eu-developer-account-paving-the-way-for-alternative-app-store.2421412/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 256GB 10.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with WiFi and cellular connectivity. GRID Studio is a company that creates framed wall art by recycling Apple products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/grid-studio-4s-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940326" /><br/>
<a href="https://gridstudio.cc/">GRID Studio</a> buys old iPhones, taking them apart and arranging each component carefully under glass to turn a hodgepodge of parts into something new. Each piece of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is labeled, with interesting device details and facts about Apple's history added in for art that's sure to appeal to Apple enthusiasts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/grid-studio-4s-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940327" /><br/>
This week, GRID Studio is having a spring sale, and <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s">the GRID 4S</a> is available for just &#36;99, down from &#36;170. It's a good price on a pivotal part of Apple's past, featuring all of the components from the 2011 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/grid-studio-4s-4.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940328" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S was the last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; introduced during Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' lifetime, and it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> released without Jobs. It was the fifth &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple came out with, and in the name, the "S" stood for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that included Apple's personal assistant.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/grid-studio-4s-5.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940329" /><br/>
Compared to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S included an upgraded A5 chip, an 8-megapixel camera, and up to 64GB of storage. It ran iOS 5, a major operating system update that brought features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> and iMessage. All of the internal components from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S are thoughtfully arranged in GRID Studio's piece, and there's even a look at the default app arrangement that was available at the time.<br/>
<br/>
The GRID 4S measures in at 11.7 by 16.5 inches, the same size as an A3 sheet of paper. It features a white background with a black frame, which allows it to match with any decor. GRID Studio also has a <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/collections/iphone">range of other iPhone pieces available</a>, with a 15 percent discount on everything this week.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> has undergone some major changes in recent years, including the switch to Apple silicon, a complete redesign, and the introduction of a 15-inch model, making it all the more important to consider if now is a good time to upgrade or if an older model will suffice for your needs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898579" /><br/>
Following its latest refresh, Apple discontinued the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; from 2020 and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; from 2023. Now, customers can choose between the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; from 2022 for &#36;999, and the M3 13- and 15-inch MacBook Airs that were just introduced for &#36;1,099 and &#36;1,299, respectively. <br/>
<br/>
See the breakdown below for each new feature, change, and improvement that was added with each &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; model since 2018 compared to its direct predecessor:<br/>

<br/>
&zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; users have very little reason to upgrade to an M3 model unless they need absolute peak performance and don't want to buy a MacBook Pro, or perhaps if they purchased the 13-inch machine in 2022 and are now interested in the 15-inch M3 model.<br/>
<br/>
Most &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; users will stand to benefit from upgrading to the M3 model, especially if they are looking for a bigger screen and opt for the 15-inch model. These users would gain a much more modern design, a larger and brighter display, better performance, faster memory, a 1080p camera, improved speakers, &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; 3, fast-charging, and more. Nevertheless, some &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; users may be better off waiting for the next major refresh if they are still happy with the machine, and upgrading is not essential.<br/>

For those who have an Intel-based &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, either of the generations currently on sale represent a highly worthwhile upgrade spearheaded by Apple silicon for a major performance improvement and upgrading is recommended, with many of the above upgrades quickly stacking up.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-air-generations-compared/">MacBook Air Buyer&#039;s Guide: Comparing the Generations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-air-buyers-guide-comparing-the-generations.2392779/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models could include a front-facing camera positioned on the side of the device so that it is upright when in a landscape orientation, individual rumors suggest.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPad-Pro-2024-Landscape-Camera-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940262" /><br/>
Currently, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models in Apple's lineup feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> camera on the top of the device, which puts the camera off-center when taking a &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; call in landscape mode. <br/>
<br/>
Seemingly recognizing the issue, Apple on the 10th-generation ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>‌ relocated the front-facing camera to the side of the device so that it would be usable in landscape mode rather than portrait mode. Apple has not launched an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; since, but it appears that Apple could be making this change on future iPads as well.<br/>
<br/>
In January of this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">code discovered in iOS 17.4</a> suggested the next &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; could adopt a similar design for the &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; camera. "During ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>‌ setup, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; needs to be in landscape with the camera at the top of the screen," read the code. <br/>
<br/>
Now, occasional leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/n/刹那数码">Instant Digital</a> on the Chinese social platform Weibo has claimed that this change is also coming to the two rumored new versions of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, in both 10.9 and 12.9-inch sizes.<br/>
<br/>
How Apple has achieved this switch to a landscape &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; camera on the new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models is unclear, since the second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> connects to both the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; using an inductive magnetic charger along the same side. <br/>
<br/>
But with Apple rumored to be launching a new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; alongside the updated iPads, Apple may have come up with a solution to the issue. Either way, we should find out soon. Both the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;OLED &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro&zwnj; models are expected to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">as soon as this month</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">iPad Air and iPad Pro Could Both Feature Landscape FaceTime Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-could-both-feature-landscape-facetime-camera.2421402/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<category>91Mobiles</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[The alleged design of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> was today showcased in new CAD renders shared by <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/iphone-16-pro-cad-renders-exclusive/"><em>91Mobiles</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-16-pro-cad-renders.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-940247" /><br/>
The drawings show a design that is similar to that of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, with a small number of changes relating to some of the buttons. The Action button is slightly longer, now resembling a similar length to one of the volume buttons, but with a slightly wider shape to distinguish it. The all-new "Capture" button is present on the left-hand side of the device where the mmWave antenna was located on previous models. While it is a similar length to the Side button, it is completely flush with the device.<br/>
<br/>
<em>91Mobiles</em> previously revealed accurate CAD renders of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/iphone-13-pro-thicker-and-larger-rear-camera/">iPhone 13 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/16/iphone-14-pro-cad-renders-no-notch/">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, but its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/">Apple Watch Series 7 designs</a> were ultimately incorrect. The website recently shared renders purporting to depict the design of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/">upcoming 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/iphone-se-4-design-revealed-in-cad-renders/">fourth-generation iPhone SE</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In January, <em>MacRumors</em> provided the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/iphone-16-pro-design/">first look at the design of the iPhone 16 Pro</a>, including a Capture button that is flush with the side of the device, which was today broadly corroborated by <em>91Mobiles</em>' CAD file. <em>MacRumors</em> subsequently obtained information suggesting that while Apple tested a longer Action button design, it has since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/12/apple-iphone-16-pro-action-button-tweaks/">scrapped the idea</a> and the Action button is now expected to look virtually the same as on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The main change to the design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max is rumored to be larger displays, increasing from 6.1- to 6.3-inches and 6.7- to 6.9-inches, respectively. Following a significant redesign with the switch to a titanium frame and more rounded edges on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; last year, little else is expected to change with the look of the new devices this year this year. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to launch in the fall. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/91mobiles-com/">91Mobiles</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/iphone-16-pro-renders-reveal-button-changes/">iPhone 16 Pro CAD Renders Reveal Button Design Changes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-cad-renders-reveal-button-design-changes.2421395/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Chrome will soon let you install any webpage as a desktop app on your Mac, just like Apple's Safari browser does in macOS Sonoma (via <em><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/any-website-pwa-chrome-124/">Android Police</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" /><br/>
The new feature was spotted by X (Twitter) user <a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1765698342191780066">Leopeva64</a> in the latest <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Chrome Canary</a> build, which includes a new option called "Install page as app," which can be found in Settings ➝ Save and share. Websites such as YouTube and Reddit which already have their own web apps will also automatically appear as optional installs in this menu.<br/>
<br/>
Selecting the "Install page as app" option invokes a prompt to "Install app," as shown in the image below. Web apps are automatically saved in an Applications subfolder called Chrome Canary Apps, where they can be optionally dragged to the Dock in macOS. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/chrome-web-apps.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940206" /><br/>
Currently, Chrome's implementation of web apps is more sophisticated than Safari's, as it provides not only a simplified toolbar with navigation buttons, but also a pared down settings menu with options including Copy URL, Open in Chrome, Uninstall, Zoom, Print, Find and Edit, and Cast.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/14/how-web-apps-work-macos-sonoma/">Here's How Web Apps Work in macOS Sonoma</a></li></ul><br/>
The feature is thanks to Chrome's long-standing support for <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/powerful-apps-fueled-by-the-web">Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</a>, which Google originally embraced as a replacement for Chrome apps on the Google Play store. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/chrome-web-app-2.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940208" /><br/>
Users can try out the feature before it goes live in the stable build of Chrome by downloading the latest <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Canary 124 update</a> and enabling two new flags. To do so, copy and paste the following links into the address bar:<br/>
<ul><li>chrome://flags/#web-app-universal-install</li><br/>
<li>chrome://flags/#shortcuts-not-apps</li></ul><br/>
Chrome 123 is currently in beta and is expected to be released to the public imminently, so PWA support for webpages won't be in the upcoming version, but the next stable build after that.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-chrome/">Google Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/google-chrome-desktop-web-apps/">Google Chrome Will Soon Let You Install Any Website as a Desktop App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-chrome-will-soon-let-you-install-any-website-as-a-desktop-app.2421386/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/retail/jingan/">announced</a> the imminent opening of its eighth retail store in central Shanghai, China, which will be named Apple Jing'an.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-store-jing-an-shanghai.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940196" /><br/>
Located on Nanjing West Road in the Jing'an District (named after its famous ancient Jing'an Temple), Apple Jing'an will become the 57th Apple store in mainland China.<br/>
<br/>
Embracing a floral theme, the <a href="https://x.com/Edourdoo/status/1765962370537722150?s=20">storefront</a> is currently draped in a veil of blooming flowers. To celebrate the opening, Apple has also made a special wallpaper for Apple devices <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/jingan/images/wallpaper/Apple_JingAn_Wallpaper_Mac.jpg">available to download</a> on its China website.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet revealed when the store will begin to welcome customers, but local reports suggest it will open its doors later this month.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is currently grappling with a significant slump in demand for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales in the country, with a recent report by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/china-iphone-sales-slump-early-2024/">CounterPoint Research</a> suggesting &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales dropped by 24 percent in the first six weeks of 2024 alone.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/">Retail</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/apple-eighth-store-shanghai-opening/">Apple&#039;s Eighth Retail Store in Shanghai Expected to Open This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-eighth-retail-store-in-shanghai-expected-to-open-this-month.2421377/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has ordered an initial 8.5 million OLED display panels from South Korean suppliers for its upcoming redesigned iPad Pro models, which are expected to arrive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">as soon as this month</a>. The refresh will mark the biggest design update to the Pro lineup since 2018.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
Apple is relying on different OLED display suppliers for the upcoming ~11-inch and ~13-inch iPad Pro models, with Samsung Display exclusively producing ~11-inch panels and LG Display making the ~13-inch panels. Based on current orders, Samsung will produce 4 million units in 2024, while LG will make 4.5 million units for the year, perhaps suggesting that the larger model is forecast to be slightly more popular.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/apple-has-two-suppliers-for-oled-ipad-pro/">Industry insiders</a> claim the division of labor is due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for OLED iPad Pro models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to be aiming for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/oled-ipad-lightweight-design-and-image-quality/">"unrivaled" display quality</a>, as well as a design that cuts down on the thickness and weight of its ‌iPad Pro models. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/2024-ipad-pro-cad-drawings/">Recent leaked CAD drawings</a> of the upcoming models offer a better idea of just how thin the tablets will be. The larger ‌iPad Pro‌, for example, will be over 1mm thinner.<br/>
<br/>
The number of OLED panels Apple orders from Samsung and LG may change after production of the initial quantity, depending on fluctuations in production yield and possible adjustments to Apple's demand forecast for the new ‌OLED ‌iPad‌ Pro‌ models. Apple's latest shipments forecast is said to have been a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-planning-to-sell-fewer-oled-ipad-pros/">decrease</a> from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/oled-ipad-pro-price-lower-than-first-thought/">OLED iPad Pro Price Hikes May Be Lower Than Early Reports Suggested</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple's ‌iPad Pro‌ models are also expected to be upgraded with faster 3-nanometer M3 chips, and MagSafe charging is a possibility. Apple is also expected to sell the devices with a new Magic Keyboard and an upgraded Apple Pencil.

		<description><![CDATA[In addition to releasing the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-4/">macOS Sonoma 14.4 update</a> on Thursday, Apple also released a new version of its <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2105?locale=en_US">Windows Migration Assistant software</a> for PCs to include compatibility with the latest version of macOS.<br/>
<br/>

Version 3.0.0.0 of the utility provides support for users looking to migrate their data from a PC running Windows 10 or later to Apple's latest Mac operating system. The assistant transfers users' contacts, calendars, email accounts, and more from a Windows machine and migrates the data to the appropriate places in macOS. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2080">Version 2.4.5.0</a> remains available for users whose Mac is running macOS Ventura, macOS Monterey, or a version of macOS Sonoma earlier than 14.4. Versions of Windows Migration Assistant for macOS Big Sur and earlier also remain available. The macOS version of Migration Assistant lives in the Applications/Utilities folder.<br/>
<br/>
Apple advises users to turn off any antivirus, firewall, or VPN software until the transfer of information is complete.

		<description><![CDATA[Like iPhones, iPads, Macs, the Apple Watch, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> are updated with new software on a regular basis. The most recent update was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-4/">released on March 7</a>, and enables <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> to learn what your preferred media service is. <br/>
<br/>

By default, updates are installed on your &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; devices automatically, but there's also a way to force an update if new software is released. However, Apple's auto-update function isn't typically immediate, so it can sometimes be handy to have a way to manually install software when you know an update has become available.<br/>
<br/>

Locating &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; updates and checking on the software version you have installed is pretty simple, but it's not entirely intuitive because the update function is buried in the Home app.<br/>
<br/>
The following steps show you how to update your &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; on devices running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> and later.<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Open the <strong>Home</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>Tap on the icon that looks like three dots in the upper right corner.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Home Settings</strong> in the dropdown menu that appears.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Software Update</strong> to see if there are any available updates.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Once you've selected "Software Update," you'll be able to see the current version of the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; software that you have installed, along with available updates, and you can toggle off automatic updates if you want.<br/>
<br/>
If there is an available update, you just need to tap the <strong>Install</strong> button to update your &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;. If you have multiple HomePods in your home, each one will be updated at the same time through this software update feature. If you're registered for &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; Beta Updates, a menu option will also appear here for updating individual HomePods.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/homepod-software-update/">How to Update to HomePod Software 17.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-update-to-homepod-software-17-4.2105572/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting today, Apple's refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models with M3 chips are available for same-day or next-day pickup at Apple Stores, with no pre-order required. Online orders are also beginning to arrive to customers today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/macbook-air-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939665" /><br/>
Customers across the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and other regions can now place an order on Apple's website or in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> app and arrange for in-store pickup at a local retail location.<br/>
<br/>
To order a product with &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; pickup, add the product to your bag on Apple.com, proceed to checkout, select the "I'll pick it up" option, enter your ZIP code, choose an available &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; location, and select a pickup date. Payment is completed online, and a valid government-issued photo ID and the order number may be required upon pickup.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the M3 chip, the new 13-inch and 15-inch ‌&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models‌ offer Wi-Fi 6E, Voice Isolation and Wide Spectrum microphone modes, enhanced voice clarity in audio and video calls, and a more fingerprint-resistant finish with the Midnight color option. They also now support up to two external displays when the laptop lid is closed, increasing from just a single external display on the previous Apple silicon models.<br/>
<br/>
There are no major external design changes to the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models, which continue to be available in Midnight, Starlight, Space Gray, and Silver colors. Pricing for the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,099, while the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,299.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/m3-macbook-air-now-available/">M3 MacBook Air Models Now Available for Same-Day Pickup</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-macbook-air-models-now-available-for-same-day-pickup.2421360/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
