		<description><![CDATA[Apple TV enthusiast Sigmund Judge has <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-tv-go-ipados-workstation/">modded an iPad Pro into a portable Apple TV</a>. The project involved modifying an Apple TV for USB-C power, routing the Apple TV's HDMI signal onto the iPad with a USB video capture device, and more.<br/>

Judge even created a custom Magic Keyboard with a silver enclosure and black keys to match the design of the Apple TV's Siri Remote.<br/>
<br/>
The modded device is called the Apple TV Go, and Judge <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-tv-go-ipados-workstation/">published a story on <em>MacStories</em></a> today with complete details about the project for those interested in learning more about the complex steps that were involved in building it.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/ipad-pro-modded-into-tvos-device/">Apple TV Go: iPad Pro Modded Into Portable tvOS Device</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-go-ipad-pro-modded-into-portable-tvos-device.2428392/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon had one of the week's best Apple deals, with &#36;100 off a huge collection of Apple Watch Series 9 models. While some of these have since expired, there are still plenty of aluminum and stainless steel models on sale at this steep discount, and you'll also find discounts on AirPods, MacBook Air, and the Apple Studio Display.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.lululook.com">Lululook</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win one of Apple's new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models and a <a href="https://www.lululook.com/products/360-rotating-foldable-magnetic-ipad-charging-stand">Lululook Magnetic Stand</a> to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/lululook-ipad-charging-stand-1.jpg" alt="" width="1466" height="825" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954160" /><br/>
Lululook has several quality stand options for Apple's latest iPads, including the &#36;130 <a href="https://www.lululook.com/products/360-rotating-foldable-magnetic-ipad-charging-stand">360 Rotating Foldable Magnetic iPad Charging Stand</a>. This stand uses the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/">Smart Connector</a> on the back of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> for charging purposes, so it works a lot like a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charger for an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The stand is plugged in at the back, and then you can simply put your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; on the magnetic surface to both charge it and have it at an ideal viewing angle for work, movies, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Smart Connector&zwnj; provides 18W of power, and it is able to fast charge an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. You can tilt the stand to any viewing angle, and rotate it around if you want to show your display to someone sitting at another desk. Both portrait and landscape mode are supported too, which means you get maximum versatility with this setup. Everything folds down, too, so you can bring it with you on the go.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/lululook-ipad-charging-stand-2.jpg" alt="" width="3000" height="2729" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954161" /><br/>
You'll need to provide your own charger and cable for the Charging Stand, and Lululook has a range of options, including the <a href="https://www.lululook.com/products/100w-usb-c-gan-charger-4-ports">100W USB-C charger with four ports</a>. It'll charge up your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, Mac, and other devices with power distributed logically depending on what you have plugged in.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want the added charging capability, the <a href="https://www.lululook.com/products/360-rotating-foldable-magnetic-ipad-stand">360 Rotating Foldable Magnetic Stand</a> has the same setup and feature set without the charging port at the back. It's &#36;30 cheaper at &#36;199, and it's available in Space Gray aluminum like the charging version.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/lululook-ipad-stand.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="842" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954163" /><br/>
Have a Mac and not an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;? Lululook makes Mac stands as well. The &#36;70 <a href="https://www.lululook.com/products/foldable-laptop-stand">360 Rotating Foldable Laptop Stand</a> can be adjusted to any angle and rotated around for screen sharing purposes. A ledge holds the MacBook safely in place, and it is able to work with any machine that's up to 16 inches in size. A heat vent at the bottom improves airflow to keep your laptop cool, and the aluminum design also dissipates heat.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/lululook-mac-stand.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="674" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954157" /><br/>
Lululook also has a range of other accessories created for Apple products, including <a href="https://www.lululook.com/collections/apple-watch-bands">Apple Watch Bands</a>, several other <a href="https://www.lululook.com/collections/desk-stand">desk stands</a>, <a href="https://www.lululook.com/collections/chargers">and chargers</a> for iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Rumors continue to surface about changes planned for Control Center on iOS 18, which Apple is set to unveil during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-wwdc-2024-keynote-june-10/">WWDC keynote on Monday</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Control-Center-Feature-Iridescent-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952915" /><br/>
The latest word comes from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, who today confirmed our report from earlier this week that said users will be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/ios-18-rumor-customizable-control-center/">rearrange controls directly within Control Center</a>. Gurman also revealed a new detail: the more customizable Control Center will allow for controls to be spread across multiple pages for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman also reiterated that the revamped Control Center will include a new music widget. We have learned that the widget will likely span the full width of Control Center, and include more visual elements like album art in its default view.<br/>
<br/>
As previously reported, more customization is also expected for the Home Screen on iOS 18. Two notable changes have been rumored, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-home-screen-app-icon-customization/">ability to place icons anywhere on the Home Screen</a>, and the option to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/ios-18-to-allow-users-to-recolor-app-icons/">change the color of app icons</a> so that they all match. For example, Gurman said all finance-related app icons could be set to green. Hopefully black is also an option, which could allow for a Dark Mode of sorts on the Home Screen.<br/>
<br/>
The first beta of iOS 18 should be available immediately after the WWDC keynote, and the update will likely be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/control-center/">Control Center</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/ios-18-control-center-multiple-pages-rumor/">Rumor: iOS 18&#039;s Revamped Control Center Will Allow for Multiple Pages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-ios-18s-revamped-control-center-will-allow-for-multiple-pages.2428384/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wwdc-2024-last-minute-leaks/id1602394741?i=1000658185012">The MacRumors Show</a>, we take a look at Apple's upcoming software updates beyond <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a>, iPadOS 18, watchOS 11, tvOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/39Vb0LtkR_w?si=RWzFLdRZrMJGi-sx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Like &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj; is expected to receive a range of AI features. Apple reportedly plans to integrate AI features across several built-in apps, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, Notes, Messages, and Mail. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is also expected to undergo significant enhancements with the ability to handle complex tasks such as summarizing articles, moving files between folders, and creating multi-step workflows. &zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj; is also rumored to feature a redesigned Calculator app and enhanced Safari capabilities with an "Intelligent Search" option.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 11 is similarly due to bring new AI-powered features to the Apple Watch, such as a more advanced version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that is better at handling on-the-go tasks. New workout types and additional watch faces are also expected. The update will likely drop support for the Apple Watch Series 4.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 2 may address some of the gaps from the initial release of the Vision Pro, such as the introduction of native versions of several Apple apps, such as Books, Calendar, and Maps. &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 2 is also expected to feature systemwide Live Captions for improved accessibility, the ability to reorder apps on the Home screen, and respiration tracking in the Mindfulness app. <br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 18 will be closely aligned with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, bringing new AI features to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. These likely include enhanced &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities, AI-assisted writing, and smart content summaries. The update will introduce a long-awaited native Calculator app to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; along with improvements to Notes, Voice Memos, and more. The Home screen is expected to be more customizable with the ability to place icons and widgets freely and change app icon colors. The Control Center may also benefit from design improvements and accessibility will be enhanced with eye tracking input.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> keynote begins at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on June 10. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today started selling refurbished versions of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-air">M3 MacBook Air models</a> that were initially released in March, providing discounts on the new machines for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/new-macbook-air-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940257" /><br/>
Pricing on the refurbished 13-inch M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> starts at &#36;929, down from &#36;1,099, while pricing on the refurbished 15-inch M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,099, down from &#36;1,299.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has many &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; configurations available in both sizes at the current time, with upgraded options for additional memory and storage. Stock will naturally fluctuate as Apple sells refurbished machines and restocks with new devices, but there are plenty to choose from if you've been holding out for a discounted M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-macbook-air/">2024 MacBook Air</a> models do not feature design updates, with the refresh focused on the improved M3 chip that is up to 30 percent faster than the prior-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's refurbished Macs are close to identical to new products. They are subject to a refurbishment process that includes full functionality testing, with any defective modules replaced, as well as a thorough cleaning and inspection. Refurbished products are eligible for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ and have the same 14-day return period as new Apple devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/apple-refurbished-m3-macbook-air/">Apple Starts Selling Refurbished M3 MacBook Air Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-starts-selling-refurbished-m3-macbook-air-models.2428381/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Only Amazon has this deal, and it has an estimated delivery date of June 10 for most residences in the United States.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple updated the MacBook Air back in March, coming in both 13-inch and 15-inch sizes and with faster M3 chips. We aren't tracking as many discounts on the 15-inch version of the M3 MacBook Air this week, but there is a solid &#36;200 markdown on the high-end <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX24BN3L%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">16GB RAM/512GB model</a> on Amazon.<br/>

<br/>
In regards to other 13-inch M3 MacBook Air models, Amazon has the 16GB RAM/512GB 13-inch MacBook Air for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX21ZSBM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,329.00</strong></a> in Space Gray, down from &#36;1,499.00.

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 will introduce at least two changes to the Tapback feature in the Messages app on the iPhone, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/apple-wwdc-2024-what-to-expect-ai-ipados-18-macos-15-siri-updates-more"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-Emoji-Tapback-Mockup.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954042" /><em>An emoji Tapback menu on iOS 18 (concept)</em></div><br/>
Introduced with iOS 10, Tapback icons are the heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, "HA HA" symbol, exclamation marks, and question mark that can be added to messages. In a report <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/apple-intelligence-service-wwdc/">outlining his WWDC expectations</a>, Gurman said these icons will look more colorful on iOS 18, whereas they currently have very basic designs.<br/>
<br/>
More significantly, he said the Tapback system will work with any emoji starting on iOS 18, providing users with hundreds of new options to choose from. This means the Messages app would finally support in-line emoji reactions, a feature that other messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, and Telegram have offered for a long time. Currently, the Messages app only allows emoji to be added to messages as stickers.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if the revamped Tapback system will also work with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">AI-generated emoji</a> feature previously reported to be coming with iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
Another much-requested feature coming to the Messages app with iOS 18 is the ability to schedule a message to be sent later, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will unveil iOS 18 and other major software updates for its platforms during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-wwdc-2024-keynote-june-10/">WWDC keynote</a>, which will be live streamed via the Apple Events website, YouTube, Apple TV app, and Apple Developer app on June 10 starting at 10 a.m. Pacific Time. The new Messages features would extend to the iPad and Mac.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/ios-18-emoji-tapback-rumor/">Rumor: iOS 18 Will Finally Let You React to iMessages With Any Emoji</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-ios-18-will-finally-let-you-react-to-imessages-with-any-emoji.2428373/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is rumored to be on the verge of integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into iOS 18. We're expecting to learn more about the partnership at WWDC on June 10, but until then, here's a way to interact with ChatGPT on your iPhone, whatever you're doing on it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/chatgpt-iphone-dynamic-island.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953965" /><br/>
Last year, OpenAI launched its free-to-use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/openai-chatgpt/id6448311069">ChatGPT app for iPhone and iPad</a>. Using the app, you can interact with the AI chatbot via text input and voice, allowing you to make the most of its generative artificial intelligence to get answers to questions and receive advice on all manner of subjects. OpenAI says that ChatGPT can help with all of the following:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Instant answers: Get precise information without sifting through ads or multiple results.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tailored advice: Seek guidance on cooking, travel plans, or crafting thoughtful messages.</li><br/>
 	<li>Creative inspiration: Generate gift ideas, outline presentations, or write the perfect poem.</li><br/>
 	<li>Professional input: Boost productivity with idea feedback, note summarization, and technical topic assistance.</li><br/>
 	<li>Learning opportunities: Explore new languages, modern history, and more at your own pace.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
History is synced across devices, so you can see your ChatGPT interactions both on the web and on iOS devices, and it integrates the Whisper speech recognition system. <br/>
<br/>
One of the lesser known features in the app is its Background Conversations feature. Basically, it allows ChatGPT to continue processing and responding to your queries even when the app is not actively open on the screen. This means you can switch to other apps or perform other tasks on your iPhone without interrupting the conversation. Here's how to fire it up.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Talk With ChatGPT in the Background on iPhone</h2><br/>
<ol><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/openai-chatgpt/id6448311069">Download the ChatGPT app</a> for iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Launch the app, then log in to your OpenAI account or create a new one.</li><br/>
<li>When the main screen appears, tap the headphones icon in the bottom-right corner to enter Voice Mode.</li><br/>
<li>Allow ChatGPT to connect to Voice. After that, you can start interacting right away. There are manual controls which allow you to pause, resume, and exit the voice conversation. When you want to do something else on your iPhone, simply swipe out of the app to enable Background Conversations mode.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/chatgpt-ios-voice.jpg" alt="" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953962" /><br/>
<br/>
ChatGPT is now actively listening in the background, and all you need to do is start speaking to pick up where you left off. If you have an iPhone with Dynamic Island, you'll see the ChatGPT symbol and a microphone icon, indicating that it's listening and ready to chat.<br/>
<br/>
If you lock your iPhone, Background Conversations mode will remain active, and it will appear as a Live Activity card on your Lock Screen. This means that you can continue to talk with ChatGPT while you're busy doing something else, as long as your iPhone is nearby. OpenAI says the Background Conversations feature is designed to be battery-efficient, and minimizes the impact on battery life by optimizing background processes and reducing unnecessary usage. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/chatgpt-background-iphone-lock.jpg" alt="Lock Screen" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953964" /><br/>
<h2>Change the Voice</h2><br/>
Voice chat was created with a range of voice actors (perhaps you heard about the recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/20/1252495087/openai-pulls-ai-voice-that-was-compared-to-scarlett-johansson-in-the-movie-her">ScarJo controversy</a>) and there are a handful to choose from if the current voice doesn't jibe with you. <br/>
<ol><li>Tap the sidebar icon in the top-left corner of the main ChatGPT window.</li><br/>
<li>Tap your account profile to open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under the "Voice Mode" section, tap <strong>Voice</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Choose from <strong>Breeze</strong>, <strong>Juniper</strong>, <strong>Ember</strong>, and <strong>Cove</strong>. You'll get a sample of the voice when you tap it.</li><br/>
<li>Hit <strong>Confirm</strong> to confirm your voice choice. </li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/chatgpt-voice-mode.jpg" alt="chatgpt" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953989" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Assign Voice Mode to iPhone Action Button</h2><br/>
If you have an iPhone with an Action Button (iPhone 15 Pro models, for example) you can easily assign ChatGPT's Voice Mode to it for quick access. <br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
<li>Tap Action Button.</li><br/>
<li>Swipe to the <strong>Shortcut</strong> option, then tap the action selector.</li><br/>
<li>Search for "ChatGPT," then select the <strong>Start voice conversation</strong> shortcut.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/chatgpt-voice-action-shortcut.jpg" alt="settings" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953986" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. Now you can simply long press the Action button on your iPhone to begin a voice conversation, whether you're in another app or if your device is locked.<br/>
<br/>
If you have privacy concerns about the feature, but still want to use the ChatGPT app, there's good news: This week, OpenAI quietly deployed a new option to turn off Background Conversations. You can find the toggle in <strong>Settings</strong> under the "Voice Mode" section. You'll know that it's disabled because the orange dot indicating mic activity won't be visible in the top-right corner of your iPhone's screen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Voice Mode Is About to Get Better</h2><br/>
Some exciting features in GPT-4's voice mode are on the horizon but haven't gone live yet. These include advanced controls for changing the emotion and tone of responses, making interactions feel even more natural. While you can already customize voices to some extent, the full integration of voice and visual inputs, which promises richer and more interactive experiences, is still in the works.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI also says developers will soon get access to a wider range of APIs to better tailor voice interactions for their needs, enhancing applications like customer service. Enhanced support for different accents and dialects is also coming, making the system more accessible globally. Finally, more detailed privacy controls for managing and reviewing voice data are being rolled out gradually. All in all, these updates will make GPT-4's voice mode even more versatile and user-friendly.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-chatgpt-mobile-app-background-chat/">How to Speak With ChatGPT in the Background on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-speak-with-chatgpt-in-the-background-on-iphone.2428367/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As the countdown to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> continues, Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-expands-developer-support-and-resources/">highlighted the tools and programs</a> that it makes available to developers, and announced an update to the Apple Developer Forums.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-developer-app-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-795934" /><br/>
Apple says that the updated forums will connect developers with more experts and with other developers for timely responses to technical questions. Apple engineers will provide code-level support, plus the forums have been reorganized into a layout of topics, subtopics, and tags to make it easier to find information.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Newsroom article delves into how many developers are using some of the programs that Apple offers, such as meeting with Apple engineers in person and attending developer academies. Meet with Apple Experts saw close to 50,000 developer engagements online and in person in 2023. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> developer labs in cities that include Cupertino, New York, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo, were attended by 6,000 developers who worked with Apple experts on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> apps.<blockquote>"It's an honor and a privilege for our teams to work directly with developers at every stage of their journeys, from students and hobbyists, to budding entrepreneurs and coding professionals," said Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. "We're always looking for new ways to support this amazing community as they bring their visions to life and push the boundaries of what is possible."</blockquote>More than 1,900 students attended Apple Developer Academies, and more than 1,800 went through an Apple Foundation Program in 2023, plus Apple also hosted five Entrepreneur Camp sessions. Apple in May debuted Pathways, which are easy-to-navigate collections of videos, documentation, and resources for developers. Since launch, more than 40,000 developers have accessed content on Pathways.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also reminded developers that &zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; sessions and videos will be shared on YouTube through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-developer-youtube-account-wwdc-2024/">new Apple Developer channel</a>. Apple has always made WWDC videos available through the Developer app and website, but this is the first year the company will also be sharing the content on YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; is set to begin next Monday with a keynote event that will take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Developers will be given access to Apple's newly announced software directly after the event in order to begin work on integrating new features into their apps.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/07/apple-developer-tools-insights/">Apple Updates Developer Forums Ahead of WWDC, Provides Insights Into Available Developer Tools</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-updates-developer-forums-ahead-of-wwdc-provides-insights-into-available-developer-tools.2428365/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will announce its new AI feature set for Apple devices at WWDC on June 10, and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/apple-wwdc-2024-what-to-expect-ai-ipados-18-macos-15-siri-updates-more">reports</a> that it will be officially called "Apple Intelligence."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Siri-Integrated-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945741" /><br/>
The AI capabilities will be coming to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. The features will be opt-in, meaning Apple won't make users adopt them if they don't want to. <br/>
<br/>
The processing requirements of AI will mean that users need an iPhone 15 Pro or one of the iPhone 16 models coming out this year to use it. For those using iPads or Macs, models will need an M1 chip at least. Apple's AI features will be powered by its own technology and tools from OpenAI, but there will also be a partnership with OpenAI that powers a ChatGPT-like chatbot.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence is expected to handle basic AI tasks, and it will work mostly on-device. In other words, the model is powered by the device's onboard processor, rather than in the cloud. It's not clear what the criteria for a basic task will be, but Apple Intelligence is said to include code that determines if a request can be processed on device or requires Apple's servers.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the key new AI-related features and changes rumored or previewed for iPhones, iPads, and Macs that we've covered so far:<br/>

In a report on Apple's AI ambitions, <em>WSJ</em> says that Federighi became an AI "convert" after testing the Copilot coding tool introduced by Microsoft-owned GitHub. Copilot, which uses OpenAI technology, was created to help programmers write, troubleshoot, and translate code into different programming languages.<br/>
<br/>
After "playing around" with GitHub Copilot in December of 2022, Federighi explained that he had "come to appreciate" generative AI, and he reportedly tasked engineering employees with creating new ways to integrate AI features into Apple's apps and features. Prior rumors have suggested that Apple is aiming to integrate AI into as many apps as possible with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and future software updates.<br/>
<br/>
Apple accelerated development on internal generative AI development, even recruiting some former Apple Car employees to work on the technology, but it has also held discussions with OpenAI and Google and is expected to rely on both its internal AI models and external partnerships.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors about features coming in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; indicate that Federighi has been successful in incorporating AI into the operating system in a number of ways, with Apple planning to add AI features to Messages, Mail, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, and other key apps. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> will also be overhauled with generative AI, making the personal assistant smarter and more capable.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix is testing a redesigned version of its TV app, reports <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172351/netflix-redesign-homepage-experience-test">The Verge</a></em>, marking the first major overhaul to the app in the last decade. The new design is a notable departure from the current look, but it is more modern and puts more information about content front and center. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/netflix-app-update.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953907" /><br/>
Customers were reportedly performing "eye gymnastics" looking around to different parts of the home screen in an attempt to find a show or movie to watch, so Netflix wanted to simplify the navigation experience. "We really wanted members to have an easier time figuring out if a title is right for them," Netflix senior director of product Pat Flemming told <em>The Verge</em>.<br/>
<br/>
The static tiles for TV shows and movies are being replaced with tiles that extend when the remote lands on them, making information like the trailer and description more centralized. Right now, when scrolling through content, show or movie information is displayed at the top of the screen. With the updated interface, that information is shown in the middle of the display, and tiles for other shows are pushed to the side.<br/>
<br/>
Hovering over a TV show or movie for an extended period of time will cause a short preview to automatically start playing.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix plans to replace the left side navigation menu with a top bar menu that features search, home, shows, movies, and My Netflix, with the menu accessible by pressing the back button on the remote. The current Categories and New and Popular tabs will be removed, but New and Popular will be replaced with the My Netflix recommendations, and Categories will be available from the search tab.<br/>
<br/>
The new design is being tested with a small group of subscribers to begin with, but it will be expanded to additional Netflix users in the coming months if it proves to be a popular change.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/netflix-tv-app-redesign/">Netflix Testing Major Apple TV App Redesign</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-testing-major-apple-tv-app-redesign.2428339/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/messages/google-messages-rcs-911-emergency/">today announced</a> that it is partnering with emergency technology company RapidSOS to allow U.S. Android users to text 911 in emergencies using its Rich Communication Services (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>) protocol.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/google-emergency-services-rcs.jpg" alt="" width="1599" height="899" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953911" /><br/>
When it is not possible to call 911, Android users will be able to send a text instead to get emergency help. The texting feature will provide precise location information to emergency responders, and it will let users send high-resolution photos and videos.<br/>
<br/>
Texting 911 will be available to U.S. Android device owners who use Google Messages, but because it is a feature baked into &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, it could also expand to other devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Later this year, Apple plans to adopt &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; to replace SMS/MMS.<br/>
<br/>
The option to text 911 via &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; will roll out to emergency call centers across the United States starting this winter. In some places, it is already possible to text 911 over SMS, but not all emergency call centers support the technology. Google is aiming to bring texting to all call centers, and to improve the ability to send photos and videos with &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;. Google says &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; for emergency 911 texts will bring the following benefits:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Confirmation that an emergency request has been delivered and viewed.</li><br/>
 	<li>The ability to see if an emergency responder is replying to a message.</li><br/>
 	<li>Options for sending high-resolution photos and videos to more accurately relay what's going on in an emergency situation.</li><br/>
 	<li>Precise location sharing, language settings, and opt-in medical information sharing.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Google says that it is working with "partners across the industry" to expand access to emergency services through &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, and that it wants to make &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; the "standard for emergency services texting everywhere."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/google-rcs-text-911/">Google Adds RCS Feature for Texting 911</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-adds-rcs-feature-for-texting-911.2428330/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to introduce a new Passwords app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a>, reports <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/apple-to-debut-passwords-app-in-challenge-to-1password-lastpass"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The Passwords app, which will serve as an alternative to third-party apps like 1Password and LastPass, will provide a simpler way for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac users to access their stored login information.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-18-WWDC-24-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944196" /><br/>
There's already a Passwords feature built into Apple's operating systems, but it is hidden in the Settings app and it can be a little difficult to find for those who are not familiar with it. Apple has been gradually introducing new password features, such as storing logins and passwords, supporting one-time login codes, and offering password generation options directly in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
Like the existing Passwords section in Settings, the dedicated Passwords app will be built on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain, Apple's feature that is able to sync login and password details across Apple devices. It will support all of the features that Passwords in Settings supports, and it will also work on the Vision Pro and Windows PCs.<br/>
<br/>
The app includes logins and passwords for websites, Wi-Fi network passwords, and Passkeys, a feature that uses <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> to log into websites instead of a password. Data from the app can be automatically inserted into websites and apps when a user logs in.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with the Passwords app is to encourage customers to use stronger passwords and avoid repeating passwords for multiple websites and services. Apple will be competing with longtime third-party password services like 1Password, and the company does plan to allow customers to import their passwords from other services.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to unveil Passwords during next Monday's WWDC keynote event.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-standalone-passwords-app/">Apple to Launch Standalone &#039;Passwords&#039; App in iOS 18 and macOS 15</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-standalone-passwords-app-in-ios-18-and-macos-15.2428328/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It's been three weeks since Apple introduced the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, and after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/two-week-review-m4-ipad-pro/">revisiting the iPad Pro</a> last week, we thought we'd take a deeper look at the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; now that it's been out long enough for day-to-day usage testing.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="M2 iPad Air Review: No Pro, No Problem!" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kblOd_DFZcU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is the best <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> for people who want a powerful tablet that's also fairly affordable. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip is close to the same chip that Apple used in the prior-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and while it's a little older now, it's still more than powerful enough for anything you might want to do on a tablet.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that Apple recently admitted an error and clarified that the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; has a 9-core GPU instead of a 10-core GPU, but in comparing the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with 10-core GPU to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with 9-core GPU, there was basically no difference in performance for day-to-day tasks and even with more system intensive apps like those used for video editing.<br/>
<br/>
As we said in our M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; review, there's nothing that can really tax the M4 chip, and that's also true of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;. With iPadOS 18 and the AI capabilities that Apple is working on, chip performance might become much more important in the future, but as of now, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; isn't going to really struggle with anything you throw at it.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; doesn't have the OLED display technology of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it lacks features like ProMotion 120Hz refresh rates, but it otherwise offers a lot of the features you get with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; at much more affordable prices. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;999, while the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;599.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> is not available on the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, with Apple instead using a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> power button. &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; isn't as reliable as &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; because it can fail depending on finger placement, but it works fine for the most part. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has a Thunderbolt port, but the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is limited to USB-C, so you can't connect Thunderbolt devices.<br/>
<br/>
You're mostly missing out on OLED and the M4 chip with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, but you also won't be able to use the redesigned Magic Keyboard that Apple made for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; because it isn't compatible with the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Apple is selling the older Magic Keyboard alongside the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, and it lacks the aluminum frame and palm rest, function keys, and the larger glass trackpad. You can still use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro and all of its features with the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, though.<br/>
<br/>
One of the nice features about the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; compared to prior-generation models is the relocated front-facing camera, which is now on the landscape edge instead of the portrait edge. That means the camera is in an upright orientation when it's in landscape mode, such as when connected to a keyboard, so it no longer looks funny if you're FaceTiming while holding the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; horizontally.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is essentially an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; without the higher-quality display, and it's a good middle tier option if you want solid performance for futureproofing but also don't want to spend &#36;1,000+ on a tablet. For a lot of people who just want a tablet for browsing the web, sending emails, and other simple day-to-day tasks, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; may even be overkill.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/m2-ipad-air-review/">Review: Three Weeks With the M2 iPad Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-three-weeks-with-the-m2-ipad-air.2428315/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rivian <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240606335706/en">today announced</a> second-generation versions of the R1S SUV and R1T pickup, and the reengineered models include support for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carkey/">Car Keys feature</a> that's available on iPhones and Apple Watches.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/rivian-r1s-v2.jpg" alt="" width="1970" height="1108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953883" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carkey/">Car Keys</a> allows an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or Apple Watch with NFC capabilities to unlock a vehicle through the Wallet app. A digital version of a car key is stored in Wallet, and unlocking can be done simply by holding an Apple Watch or &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; near a compatible vehicle's NFC reader.<br/>
<br/>
A simple tap on the door handle is enough to initiate an unlock, and while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> authentication is a security option, Apple offers an Express Mode that eliminates the need to authenticate for a faster unlocking process.<br/>
<br/>
Prior Rivian vehicles supported unlocking through the Rivian app, but &zwnj;Car Keys&zwnj; is a different feature that is better integrated into the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch. While the Rivian app was able to sense a user approaching and unlock the car, it was slow to work and not as accurate or as simple as &zwnj;Car Keys&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Rivian has added Ultra Wideband technology to its new vehicles for improved accuracy.<br/>
<blockquote>Use your phone or smartwatch to automatically lock or unlock doors when you're nearby. Accessing your vehicle is easier than ever -- thanks to ultrawideband technology enabled by the wallet feature on iOS and Android.</blockquote><br/>
Rivian says that &zwnj;Car Keys&zwnj; feature can be used with the R1S and R1T for unlocking and starting their vehicles, plus sharing digital keys with family and friends.<br/>
<br/>
Along with &zwnj;Car Keys&zwnj;, the updated Rivian models also feature Connect+, a streaming service that provides access to over 3,000 apps, including music services. Rivian says that it worked with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> team to "deeply integrate" &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; into Rivian's Connect+ platform. Customers can access &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s more than 100 million songs, and with Rivian Premium Audio, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Spatial Audio is supported.<br/>
<br/>
