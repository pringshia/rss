		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/11/shazam-hits-100-billion-song-recognitions/">announced</a> that music recognition tool Shazam has identified more than 100 billion songs since it launched. Shazam started as an SMS service in the U.K. in 2002, and it became one of the first iPhone apps available on the App Store in 2008.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Shazam-100-Billion.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978424" /><br/>
Apple shared some fun comparisons for this statistic:<blockquote>- That's equivalent to 12 songs identified for every person on Earth.<br/>
- A person would need to use Shazam to identify a song every second for 3,168 years to reach 100 billion.<br/>
- That's more than 2,200x the number of identifications of Shazam's top song ever, "Dance Monkey," with over 45 million tags.<br/>
- Shazam Predictions 2023 alum Benson Boone's "Beautiful Things" was the first track released this year to hit 10 million recognitions, and the fastest, doing so in 178 days. At that pace, it would take more than 4,800 years for it to hit 100 billion.</blockquote>Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/09/24/apple-shazam-acquisition-finalized/">acquired Shazam</a> in 2018, and it now powers the Music Recognition feature built into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Shazam is deeply integrated across Apple's software platforms, including in Control Center, Siri, as an Action button option on iPhone 15 Pro models and all iPhone 16 models, as a Smart Stack widget on the Apple Watch, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The playlist below includes Shazam's top 100 most-identified songs, with the list currently topped by the 2019 song "Dance Monkey" by Tones and I.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has knocked the price off of multiple M3 MacBook Air models, with as much as &#36;300 off select computers. Prices start at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DLHY19N3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;849.00</strong></a> for the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air (16GB RAM/256GB), and also include multiple 15-inch models as well.<br/>
<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
All of these deals have been applied automatically and do not require an on-page coupon in order to see the final sale prices. Apple introduced the M3 MacBook Air back in March, and last month it increased the starting RAM to 16GB, from 8GB.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Uber has <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/airport-travel/">announced</a> that it will be releasing a Home Screen widget for the iPhone today, allowing users to request a ride in as little as two taps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Uber-Home-Screen-Widget-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978404" /><br/>
The widget can display your saved addresses for home and work, or you can tap on the magnifying glass icon to quickly search for another address.<br/>
<br/>
We do not see the widget yet. It will likely be added in an update to the Uber app later today.<br/>
<br/>
The widget is one of several new features that Uber is introducing ahead of the busy travel season in the U.S., which kicks off with Thanksgiving next week. Other additions include a new UberXXL vehicle option, UberX Share at airports for discounted rides with one other passenger, and more, with complete details outlined <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/airport-travel/">in Uber's press release</a>.<br/>
<br/>
UberXXL lets you request a vehicle with larger trunk space for your baggage on rides to and from airports. The feature is now available at more than 60 airports across the U.S., Canada, and select other countries, and it will expand to more airports later.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/uber/">Uber</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/20/uber-adding-iphone-home-screen-widget/">Uber Adding Home Screen Widget on iPhone, UberXXL Option, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uber-adding-home-screen-widget-on-iphone-uberxxl-option-and-more.2443535/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This article explains how to erase and factory reset your Mac if you plan to give it away, sell it, or trade it in. Apple silicon Macs and Intel Macs with a T2 security chip (2017-2020 models) have an "Erase All Content and Settings" option available in macOS Monterey and later. If you have an older pre-2017 Mac, it's a more convoluted process – <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/erase-and-factory-reset-your-mac/">follow this link instead</a> to erase and factory reset your machine.<br/>
<br/>

Traditionally, wiping a Mac and returning it to factory settings involved manually signing out of a range of services, erasing your Mac's internal drive, then reinstalling macOS. These steps are quite involved when you consider how easy it is to wipe an iPhone or iPad (<strong>Settings -> General -> Transfer or Reset iPhone -> Erase All Content and Settings</strong>).<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Apple includes the same option on newer Macs running macOS Monterey and later. Erase All Content and Settings in macOS offers a very simple and straightforward way to erase your Mac without needing to reinstall the operating system. Thanks to the way storage is encrypted on Macs with Apple silicon or the T2 chip, the option is able to instantly and securely "erase" all user date by destroying the encryption keys.<br/>
<br/>
Not only does this effectively erase all user data and user-installed apps from your Mac without reinstalling macOS, it also signs out your Apple Account from a range of services, removes any Touch ID fingerprints, purchases, and all Apple Wallet items, and turns off Find My and Activation Lock, making it far easier to restore your Mac to like-new factory settings.<br/>
<br/>
The following steps show you how it's done. Whether you simply want to start fresh with your Mac or are planning to sell or gift your computer to another person, after erasing it using this option, your Mac will display the Setup Assistant and be ready to be set up like new.<br/>
<ol><li>Click the <strong>Apple () symbol</strong> in the menu bar and select <strong>System Settings</strong> (<strong>System Preferences...</strong> if you're not running macOS Ventura or later).</li><br/>
<li>If you're running macOS Ventura or later, select <strong>General</strong> in the sidebar, then choose <strong>Transfer or Reset -> Erase All Content and Settings...</strong>. Otherwise, select <strong>System Preferences -> Erase All Content and Settings</strong> from the menu bar.<br/>

<li>Enter your admin password in the Erase Assistant dialog prompt and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>If you haven't already backed up your important data, heed the onscreen Time Machine advice. Otherwise, click <strong>Continue</strong>.<br/>

<li>Note all the settings, data, media, and other items that will be removed. Click <strong>Continue</strong> if you're sure.<br/>

<li><br/>
<li>Enter the password for your Apple Account to sign out, click <strong>Continue</strong>, then click <strong>Erase All Content & Settings</strong> in the prompt to confirm.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/erase-content-settings-mac1.jpg" alt="erase" width="1600" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978387" /></ol>After following these steps, allow the erase process to complete. Your Mac may restart more than once during the process. Once finished, you'll see the "hello" message on your Mac's screen, indicating that your Mac has been restored to factory settings and Setup Assistant is ready to start anew.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/erase-factory-reset-apple-silicon-mac/">How to Erase and Factory Reset Your Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-erase-and-factory-reset-your-mac.2443524/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AT&T has begun displaying "Turbo" in the iPhone carrier label for customers subscribed to its premium network prioritization service, according to reports on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/comments/1gv20qt/att_turbo_indicator_iphone_16_pro_max/">Reddit</a>. The new indicator seems to have started appearing after users updated to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-releases-ios-18-1-1-and-ipados-18-1-1/">iOS 18.1.1</a>, but that could be just coincidence.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/at-t-turbo-indicator-iphone-16-pro-max-v0-8hrh7w5f3w1e1.jpg.jpeg" alt="" width="1320" height="921" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978376" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/comments/1gv20qt/att_turbo_indicator_iphone_16_pro_max/">No_Highlight7476</a></em></div><br/>
The <a href="https://www.att.com/plans/att-turbo/">Turbo feature</a> provides enhanced network performance through prioritized data access, offering improved speeds and lower latency for activities like gaming and video streaming. Previously, customers had limited ways to confirm the service was enabled beyond checking technical network settings. With the new label, Turbo subscribers can easily verify when the &#36;7 monthly add-on is active on their line.<br/>
<br/>
Some users have said they aren't too happy about the longer carrier text in their iPhone's status bar, but others don't mind it since it gives them a clear visual indicator of their premium network status. AT&T says that the icon can appear sometimes when Turbo is inactive, such as when connected to Wi-Fi or when a customer's hotspot allotment is exceeded.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/att/">AT&amp;T</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/20/att-turbo-iphone-carrier-label-ios-update/">AT&amp;T Turbo Indicator Showing Up in iPhone Status Bar for Subscribers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/at-t-turbo-indicator-showing-up-in-iphone-status-bar-for-subscribers.2443520/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/remedygames.com/post/3lbch2m27ot2a">announced</a> that <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em> will launch on Mac on February 12, 2025. The award-winning action-adventure game has garnered over 80 industry accolades since its 2019 debut, and two expansions in the intervening years have kept the franchise alive.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/control-ultimate-edition-mac.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978368" /><br/>
The Ultimate Edition includes the base game alongside its two major expansions, "The Foundation" and "AWE," plus all post-launch updates. Inspired by the new weird literary genre, the supernatural third-person action game puts players in the role of Jesse Faden as she explores the mysterious Federal Bureau of Control, wielding telekinetic powers and transforming weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Remedy's announcement was spotted by <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/control-ultimate-edition-comes-to-macs-on-february-12-181018677.html">Engadget</a></em> during the company's <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/">Capital Markets Day presentation</a> to investors. While specific Mac system requirements haven't been revealed, the game will presumably require an M-series chip to run effectively, given its demanding graphics and physics engine.<br/>
<br/>

The developer also confirmed that work continues on <em>Control 2</em>, though no further details about the sequel were shared. <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em> previously launched on Windows PC, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms, so this will be its first appearance on macOS.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/20/control-ultimate-edition-mac-february-12-2025/">&#039;Control Ultimate Edition&#039; Coming to Mac on February 12, 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/control-ultimate-edition-coming-to-mac-on-february-12-2025.2443517/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Graykey, a forensics tool used by law enforcement officials to break into locked iPhones, has limited access to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and iOS 18.0.1, <a href="https://www.404media.co/leaked-documents-show-what-phones-secretive-tech-graykey-can-unlock-2/"><em>404 Media</em> recently learned</a>. The site secured documents that describe Graykey's functionality in-depth, giving us a look at what the device is capable of.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-pro-max.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964613" /><br/>
Graykey parent company Magnet Forensics does not share information about the tool, and complete details about the devices that Graykey can unlock have not surfaced before.<br/>
<br/>
Most iPhones that run &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; or iOS 18.0.1 are listed as eligible for a "partial" unlock, though the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 11 models can seemingly be unlocked in full. Data on iOS 18.1, a newer version of iOS, isn't included in the document, but iOS 18.1 betas were listed as inaccessible.<br/>
<br/>
It's not clear what "partial" access means or what data can be garnered from iPhones with that access listing, but it might mean that law enforcement are limited to unencrypted files, file size information, and folder structure. On more vulnerable devices, Graykey can unlock an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a 4-digit passcode in mere minutes, while longer passcodes can take hours.<br/>
<br/>
Graykey takes advantage of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; vulnerabilities to unlock devices, and its capabilities can change as Apple patches security flaws. In 2018, for example, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/24/graykey-iphone-unlocking-box-disabled-by-ios-12/">disabled Graykey</a> with an update to iOS 12, but new vulnerabilities were found that restored functionality. Eventually, Magnet Forensics may be able to find a flaw that will allow Graykey to get into &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; devices as well.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, a leak from Israel-based mobile forensics company Cellebrite suggested that its tools are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/cellebrite-unable-to-unlock-iphones-on-ios-17-4/">unable to unlock iPhones</a> that are running iOS 17.4 or later, but it is now able to access devices running iOS 17.5.1.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/graykey-ios-18-partial-unlock/">&#039;Graykey&#039; Tool Used by Law Enforcement Can Only Partially Unlock iOS 18 Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/graykey-tool-used-by-law-enforcement-can-only-partially-unlock-ios-18-devices.2443494/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Using the reset tool removes prior data that's used to power Explore, Reels, and Feed recommendations.<br/>

Recommendations will start to personalize over time, providing content recommendations based on the content and accounts that users interact with. Using the reset option will provide users with an option to review the accounts they're following to unfollow content they no longer want to see, and review ad topics.<br/>
<br/>
The tool is designed for teen users, but Instagram is planning to make it available to all users following the test period.

		<description><![CDATA[Google today revamped its Switch to Android app for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, introducing a streamlined interface, a new icon, and changing the name <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/android-switch/id6449987166">to Android Switch</a> as part of a rebranding effort to lure new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/google-android-switch-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978341" /><br/>
The app is designed to make it easy for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to swap over to an Android-based device like a Google Pixel. It can transfer contacts, calendar events, photos, and videos, and it includes reminders to turn off iMessage to swap to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>/SMS.<br/>
<br/>
Google has also changed some of the wording on its Switch to Android website to reflect the new app name. The Switch to Android site walks through some of the common concerns that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users might have about switching platforms, such as texting, sharing files, making video calls, and transitioning accessories.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, Google says Android users can text &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users with no issues, and the company recommends Google Meet as an alternative to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>. There's no Android to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; replacement for AirDrop, but Google says that Quick Share can be used to share files with Android, ChromeOS, and Windows PC devices.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from design updates and a new look for the app, the basic functionality of the Android Switch app appears to be the same as before.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/google-rebrands-android-switcher-app/">Google Rebrands Switcher App to Lure iPhone Users to Android</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-rebrands-switcher-app-to-lure-iphone-users-to-android.2443484/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's free butterfly keyboard service program for select MacBooks models <a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks">ended</a> late last week, nearly six and a half years after it launched.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/MacBook-Keyboard-Close.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941611" /><br/>
With the program now over, it is no longer guaranteed that customers with affected MacBook keyboards will be able to receive a free repair from Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. However, exceptions could be made.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we take a look back at Apple's butterfly keyboard problems that led to the program.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Butterfly Keyboard</h2><br/>
For much of the 2000s, MacBook keyboards had a traditional scissor switch mechanism. That changed in March 2015, when Apple released an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/09/apple-new-macbook-2015/">ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook</a> with a low-profile keyboard that used a new butterfly switch mechanism. While the keyboard fit in the 12-inch MacBook's thin enclosure, it is prone to issues, such as letters repeating unexpectedly or failing to appear when keys are pressed.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-vs-scissor-keyboard/">Apple's Butterfly Keyboards vs. Scissor Switch Keyboards</a></li></ul><br/>
It was not until Apple updated the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with its second-generation butterfly keyboard in October 2016 that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/21/2016-macbook-pro-keyboard-issues/">customers began to complain</a> about sticky and unresponsive keys in earnest. Apple expanded the butterfly keyboard to the MacBook Air a few years later, leading to even more complaints.<br/>
<br/>
The situation came to a head in May 2018, when Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/05/14/macbook-pro-keyboard-class-action-lawsuit/">hit with a class action lawsuit</a> in the U.S. alleging that the company knew the butterfly keyboard was defective. An online <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-apple-recall-macbook-pro-w-defective-keyboard-replace-with-different-working-keyboard">petition about the issues</a> that year gained nearly 43,000 signatures.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Program</h2><br/>
In June 2018, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/22/apple-macbook-pro-keyboard-repair-program/">launched a "Keyboard Service Program"</a> worldwide after it determined that a "small percentage" of keyboards in certain MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro models may exhibit one or more of the following behaviors:<ul><li>Letters or characters repeat unexpectedly</li><br/>
<li>Letters or characters do not appear</li><br/>
<li>Key(s) feel "sticky" or do not respond in a consistent manner</li></ul>Apple and Apple Authorized Service Providers had been repairing eligible MacBook keyboards, free of charge, for up to four years after the first retail sale of the affected laptop. That window is now closed, as all eligible models were discontinued more than four years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/ifixit-butterfly-keyboard-mac.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-823726" /><em>The butterfly switch mechanism for a 2018 MacBook Pro keyboard (iFixit)</em></div><br/>
The list of all models that were eligible:<ul><li>MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, Early 2015)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook (Retina, 12­-inch, Early 2016)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, 2017)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2019)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13­-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2016)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2017)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2018)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2019)</li></ul><h2>The Apology</h2><br/>
In March 2019, Apple finally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/27/apple-apologizes-about-third-gen-keyboard-issues/">apologized about the keyboards</a>.<br/>
<br/>
"We are aware that a small number of users are having issues with their third-generation butterfly keyboard and for that we are sorry," an Apple spokesperson said, in a statement shared with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern. "The vast majority of Mac notebook customers are having a positive experience with the new keyboard."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Fix</h2><br/>
Starting with the 16-inch MacBook Pro in November 2019, Apple ditched the butterfly keyboard and returned to using a scissor switch mechanism. The change was extended to the MacBook Air in March 2020, and to the 13-inch MacBook Pro in May 2020, marking the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/04/rip-butterfly-keyboard/">end of the problematic butterfly keyboard era</a> for the Mac. All models of MacBooks with Apple silicon chips have continued to use scissor switch keyboards.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Settlement</h2><br/>
In July 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/29/apple-butterfly-keyboard-settlement-approval/">agreed to pay &#36;50 million</a> to settle the U.S. class action lawsuit related to the butterfly keyboard issues. Affected customers who submitted a valid claim by the March 2023 deadline <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/macbook-faulty-keyboard-payouts/">received a payment</a> of between &#36;50 and &#36;395.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/">Butterfly Keyboard Issues</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ends-mac-butterfly-keyboard-service-program/">Apple Ends Butterfly Keyboard Repair Program for MacBooks</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ends-butterfly-keyboard-repair-program-for-macbooks.2443482/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley and his colleagues recently traveled to Asia to meet with various electronics manufacturers and suppliers. In a research note this week, outlining key takeaways from the trip, the analysts said they have "confirmed" that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-4/">fourth-generation iPhone SE</a> with an Apple-designed 5G modem is slated to launch towards the end of the first quarter next year. In line with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/">previous rumors</a>, that timeframe suggests the new iPhone SE will be announced in March, just like the current model was in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
The fourth-generation iPhone SE is expected to have a similar design as the base iPhone 14, with rumored features including a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a newer A-series chip, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM to enable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/">Apple Intelligence support</a>, and the previously-mentioned Apple-designed 5G modem.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to have been working on its own 5G modem for iPhones since 2018, a move that will allow it to reduce and eventually eliminate its dependance on Qualcomm. Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/">extended its 5G modem supply agreement with Qualcomm</a> for iPhone launches through 2026, so Apple still has plenty of time to complete the transition to its in-house modem. Along with the fourth-generation iPhone SE, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said the so-called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">"iPhone 17 Air" will have an Apple-designed 5G modem</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if Apple's first 5G modem would unlock any consumer benefits compared to Qualcomm's modems, such as faster speeds.<br/>
<br/>
In 2017, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/20/apple-qualcomm-1-billion-lawsuit/">Apple sued Qualcomm</a> over anticompetitive practices and &#36;1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates. The two companies settled the lawsuit in 2019, and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/">acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> that same year. That purchase provided Apple with a portfolio of cellular-related patents to bolster its development. In another four months from now, it seems like we will finally see the fruit of this labor.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the third-generation iPhone SE during an online event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-announces-new-iphone-se/">on March 8, 2022</a>. The device looks similar to the iPhone 8, with outdated features such as a Touch ID button, Lightning port, and thick bezels around the display. In the U.S., the iPhone SE currently starts at &#36;429, but the new model might see at least a slight price increase.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/barclays/">Barclays</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/iphone-se-4-expected-to-launch-in-march/">iPhone SE 4 With Apple&#039;s Own 5G Modem &#039;Confirmed&#039; to Launch in March</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-with-apples-own-5g-modem-confirmed-to-launch-in-march.2443478/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 18.1.1, iPadOS 18.1.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1.1 updates that Apple released today address <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121752">JavaScriptCore and WebKit vulnerabilities</a> that Apple says have been actively exploited on some devices. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/bug-security-vulnerability-issue-fix-larry.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896108" /><br/>
With the JavaScriptCore vulnerability, processing maliciously crafted web content could lead to arbitrary code execution. The WebKit vulnerability had the same issue with maliciously crafted web content, and it could lead to a cross site scripting attack.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that it is aware of reports that these two issues may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems. While the vulnerabilities are only known to have impacted older Macs, other devices are vulnerable to attack because they have the same security flaws. <br/>
<br/>
For that reason, it is a good idea to update your devices to the latest software as soon as possible. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/ios-18-1-1-active-exploit-fix/">Make Sure to Update: iOS 18.1.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1.1 Fix Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/make-sure-to-update-ios-18-1-1-and-macos-sequoia-15-1-1-fix-actively-exploited-vulnerabilities.2443465/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated the Apple Developer app that is available to the developer community, introducing a few new features that improve the app usage and navigation experience. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-developer-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757303" /><br/>
For viewing videos in a topic or event, users can now choose between grid or list views for easier sorting. There are now custom dark and tinted appearances for the Apple Developer app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and the detail view for videos provides an indicator when a video has been fully watched, so it's simpler to keep track of previously-viewed content. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says the app also includes bug fixes and "various other enhancements" that are minor enough not to make it into the app update release notes. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-developer-app-dark-icons/">Apple Developer App Gains Custom Dark and Tinted Icons</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-developer-app-gains-custom-dark-and-tinted-icons.2443467/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

When purchasing goods and services from Booking.com and ChargePoint, &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users will now get more cash back.<br/>

Booking.com is a site for reserving flights, cars, cruises, and hotels, while ChargePoint sells charging equipment for electric vehicles and also offers more than 280,000 charging stations across multiple countries.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users can get three percent Daily Cash back from Booking.com on eligible prepaid stays and car rentals when purchasing using &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, though Apple says that its <a href="https://www.booking.com/c/apple-card/index.html?aid=2417311">special Apple Card link</a> needs to be used when booking. Eligible stays include those that are paid for using the "Pay Now" rate.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1.1, a minor update for the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; operating system. The 15.1.1 update comes three weeks after Apple released the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macOS-Sequoia-Night-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961501" /><br/>
Mac users can download the ‌&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;‌ update by using the Software Update section of System Settings.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the past week and a bit, Apple has shared a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU3KE5f7ZcQ">iPhone 16 Pro ad</a> called "All Systems Pro" on its YouTube channels in select countries, such as Japan, India, South Korea, and Singapore. Apple has yet to share the ad on its U.S. channel.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yU3KE5f7ZcQ?si=towzz6oyOlU2b2LU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
In the ad, a mission control center goes through a series of final checks before launching an iPhone 16 Pro into space like a rocket. During a 30-second countdown, the team ensures that all aspects of the A18 Pro chip are ready to go, such as the Neural Engine, 6-core GPU, and support for recording slow-mo 4K video at 120 fps. <br/>
<br/>
"A18 Pro has a faster Neural Engine, improved CPU and GPU, and a big jump in memory bandwidth," the video description says. "It also drives advanced video and photo features like Camera Control, and delivers great graphics performance for next-level gaming."<br/>
<br/>
When it announced the iPhone 16 Pro models in September, Apple said the A18 Pro chip is up to 15% faster than the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models. The chip is manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ad-sends-iphone-16-pro-to-space/">Apple Sends iPhone 16 Pro to Space in New Ad Promoting A18 Pro Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sends-iphone-16-pro-to-space-in-new-ad-promoting-a18-pro-chip.2443451/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
