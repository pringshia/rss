		<description><![CDATA[Hyundai's luxury brand <a href="https://www.genesis.com/us/en/home">Genesis</a> has been gaining increasing attention over the course of its relatively short lifetime, and I recently had a chance to try out a 2023 Electrified GV70 SUV to see how the infotainment experience stacks up for an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owner.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925005" /><br/>
My test vehicle was a high-end Prestige trim with a beautiful 14.5-inch widescreen center screen, complemented by a 12.3-inch all-digital driver display featuring autostereoscopic 3D technology, plus an additional head-up display for viewing key information without having to take your eyes off the road.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-sky.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925017" /><em>Infotainment display</em></div><br/>
The GV70's center display is mounted high on the dashboard and set back a decent amount, which puts it in a good spot for glancing at without having to look too far away from what's in front of you, but the positioning and widescreen dimensions make operating it via the touchscreen a bit of a reach. To address that, Genesis also includes a rotary controller and a number of buttons within easy reach of the driver on the center console.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-rotary-controller.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925012" /><em>Rotary controller located above a rotary shifter dial</em></div><br/>
The rotary controller includes a dial for navigating between user interface elements, and you can press the dial to register your selection, but the dial can also be rocked to move more quickly move between pages and sections in the system. The surface of the controller is also touch-sensitive, allowing you to draw out letters when trying to search for destinations or performing other tasks where text entry is needed. Voice commands are typically a much superior method for this, however.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the rotary controller, there are several buttons located directly above it on the console to quickly access specific functions in the infotainment system, including dedicated Home, Menu, and Back buttons. Scroll-style buttons also allow for easy volume and tuning adjustments.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-steering-wheel.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925013" /><em>Steering wheel controls</em></div><br/>
Steering wheel controls are another method for controlling some infotainment functions, and there's even another strip of buttons on the center stack below the climate controls with quick access to the map, navigation, radio, and media functions. This strip and the steering wheel each have a user-configurable "star" button that can be set to jump you straight into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, climate controls have their own dedicated section separate from the main infotainment screen and they include a combination of physical and digital controls that works quite well. The driver and passenger each have a knob for adjusting the temperature for their respective sides of the cabin, and there additional commonly used controls to the outside of these dials.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-climate.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925014" /><em>Dedicated climate controls</em></div><br/>
These climate controls are not individual buttons, but the small panels they're on do move when pressed, providing some tactile feedback. Other settings like heated and cooled seats, heated steering wheel, and manual fan speed adjustments are made on a digital screen, so they're harder to manage by feel, although they do provide some haptic and audio feedback when pressed.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-menu.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925348" /><em>Menu screen for native infotainment</em></div><br/>
For the most part, the native infotainment system has a sleek, modern look, with high-resolution graphics and a logical layout of screens and panels that's easy to navigate using the rotary controller or by touch.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-nature-sounds.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925349" /><em>Nature sounds</em></div><br/>
A full array of functions are available, from SiriusXM to onboard navigation to EV data. There are even a variety of soothing nature sounds that can be piped throughout the cabin, and there's a weather app complete with a radar view.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-nav.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925350" /><em>Built-in navigation</em></div><br/>
The onboard navigation is functional and helpful with both overview and next-turn views available simultaneously while a route is in progress, but the look could stand some modernization to better match the rest of the infotainment system.<br/>
<br/>
In the driver's display, Genesis includes the neat Blind-Spot View Monitor system that Hyundai has offered for a number of years, which uses cameras on the side-view mirror to display a live video feed of your blind spot on a given side when you engage your turn signal. It's a handy feature that I wish was common in more brands.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-driver-display.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925015" /><em>Driver display with stereoscopic 3D view and Blind-Spot View Monitor</em></div><br/>
The other clever driver's display feature that comes as part of the Prestige package on the GV70 is the 3D aspect. It's something you really have to experience in person to fully grasp, but it takes advantage of parallax with offset images to turn gauges and other digital aspects of the instrument cluster into three-dimensional representations that give a sense of depth.<br/>
<br/>
A camera pointed at the driver tracks their position and gaze, adjusting the 3D effect accordingly. The whole thing is a bit gimmicky, but it's kind of neat and stands out as something different to help set the high-end Genesis trims apart.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925010" /><em>USB ports and wireless charging pad in center console</em></div><br/>
The GV70 includes a pair of USB-A ports (one for charge and data and one for charging only) in a small cubby on the center console that also includes a wireless Qi charger. As with many car chargers, it can be difficult to get a reliable wireless charging connection, likely due to the slab-style charger design and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s camera bump and case lip interfering with positioning on the charger.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-rear-climate-usb-jpg.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925011" /><em>Rear climate controls and USB charging ports</em></div><br/>
On the rear of the center console are climate controls and a pair of USB-A charging ports for rear passengers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>CarPlay</h2><br/>
As you'd hope, the Electrified GV70 supports &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, but unfortunately only via a wired connection. Genesis is currently a victim of an odd split in Hyundai's infotainment systems wherein lower-tier systems support both wired and wireless &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; while higher-end systems with built-in navigation only support wired &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;. There have been rumors of Hyundai and Genesis adding wireless &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; to some of these higher-tier systems on select models via a software update in the relatively near future, but we'll have to see if that pans out.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-carplay-home.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925006" /><em>&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Home screen</em></div><br/>
So if you want to use &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, you're going to have plug your phone in, and it's unfortunate that more modern USB-C ports aren't included. The charging and USB compartment includes a spring-loaded cover to help hide things away, but if you've got a Pro Max-sized &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a cable sticking out the bottom for &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, you'll have a very difficult time getting that cover to close properly.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-carplay-maps.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925007" /><em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> in &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;</em></div><br/>
&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; looks great on the GV70's widescreen display, which even leaves enough room for a sidebar off to the right where you can view other functions from the native infotainment system. You can see your current radio station or audio track information, a compass, a dedicated clock, vehicle battery information, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-carplay-now-playing.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925008" /><em>Now Playing screen in &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;</em></div><br/>
On the downside, &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; is a single-screen experience in the GV70, as it doesn't get the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/volvo-dual-screen-apple-maps-carplay/">dual-screen experience</a> rolling out recently to Volvo and a few other brands, and it doesn't even get the more basic &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; navigation prompts in the driver display or the head-up display that are available on many vehicles. Navigation prompts from the native navigation system do appear in the head-up display, so that's a plus for using the Hyundai/Genesis system. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-carplay-dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925009" /><em>&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Dashboard view</em></div><br/>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2><br/>
The Genesis Electrified GV70 starts at a little over &#36;65,000, with the Prestige package on my test model, a paint upcharge, and destination fees bringing things to a little shy of &#36;75,000. It's not cheap, and its range clocks in at only 236 miles (and even a bit less than that in real-world review), but overall it's a fun drive with a boost mode that lets you go 0–60 in around four seconds.<br/>
<br/>
It's also packed with technology from the gorgeous center display to the 3D driver's display to a fingerprint authentication system. My main gripes on this front are the lack of wireless connectivity for &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, USB-A ports rather than USB-C, and an inconvenient phone storage/charging setup.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, those issues will be addressed in upcoming model years (or even via software updates to existing models such as for wireless &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;), but even now if the issues aren't deal-breakers and you're willing and able to spend that kind of cash, the Electrified GV70 is a pretty compelling package. A gasoline-powered version is also available for a still-premium but significantly lower price tag, but you'll be missing out on some of the fun EV features like zippy acceleration.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genesis/">Genesis</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/2023-genesis-electrified-gv70-carplay/">Review: 2023 Genesis Electrified GV70 Offers Lots of Tech, but You&#039;ll Need a Cable for CarPlay</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-2023-genesis-electrified-gv70-offers-lots-of-tech-but-youll-need-a-cable-for-carplay.2412995/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to refresh the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> around March 2024, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/apple-prepares-m3-macbook-air-and-revamped-ipad-pro-for-early-next-year">said today in a report</a> on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/">Apple's future iPad</a> and Mac plans. Updated 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models are in the works.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/15inch-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916649" /><br/>
As Apple overhauled the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s design in 2022 and then introduced a larger model in 2023, no design changes are planned for the 2024 models. The focus will instead be on new internal hardware, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">the updated M3 chip</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Introduced earlier this year in the updated MacBook Pro models, the M3 chip is the first chip built on Apple's 3-nanometer process, bringing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/how-much-better-really-is-m3/">performance and efficiency improvements</a>. M3 chip benchmarks suggest that the CPU is up to 21 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>, and the GPU is up to 15 percent faster.<br/>
<br/>
According to Gurman, Apple is developing the Macs alongside macOS 14.3, an update that is expected between the end of January and February, but new hardware may ship around the March timeframe. The new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models could be timed to launch alongside updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, which are coming around March.<br/>
<br/>
There is no word yet on when other Macs might be refreshed. The MacBook Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> models were updated in October 2023, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> was last updated in January 2023, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> updated in June 2023.<br/>
<br/>
In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, Apple saw a steep decline in Mac sales. Macs brought in &#36;7.6 billion, down 34 percent from the &#36;11.5 billion that Apple earned in Q4 2022. Apple expects Mac sales to go up following the launch of the October MacBook Pro models, and an early 2024 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; refresh will also help to drive growth.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/macbook-air-march-2024/">New M3 MacBook Air Models Expected Around March 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-m3-macbook-air-models-expected-around-march-2024.2412990/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To boost falling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales, Apple has a major refresh planned for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup in early 2024, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/apple-prepares-m3-macbook-air-and-revamped-ipad-pro-for-early-next-year">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. Apple plans to debut new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, both of which will feature notable changes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/12.9-inch-ipad-pro-cyber.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875252" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will come in two sizes like the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; for the first time. The smaller model will continue to measure in at 10.9 inches, but the larger version will be 12.9 inches, like the larger &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Apple is aiming to provide more variety between screen size and price, and the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be more affordable than the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's 2024 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will feature OLED displays, a first for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup. Apple has been using OLED technology for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the Apple Watch, but larger OLED screens are more expensive. Compared to LED or mini-LED, OLED brings deeper blacks and more vivid colors. OLED displays will be a Pro-only feature, with the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to continue to use standard displays.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says that the high-end version of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will be equipped with the new M3 chip that Apple introduced earlier this year. The M3 is built on 3-nanometer technology, and it will bring notable graphics improvement over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip that is currently used in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will refresh the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> and the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in 2024, but it is unclear if these tablets will be updated at the same time as the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
To go along with the updated iPads, Apple plans to introduce a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> and new Magic Keyboards. The updated Magic Keyboards are said to have a sturdier frame made from aluminum, which will allow the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to more closely resemble a laptop.<br/>
<br/>
There were no iPads released in 2023, which is the first time that Apple has not debuted a new tablet during a calendar year. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue came in at &#36;28.3 billion in 2023, down from &#36;29.3 billion in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models and their accompanying accessories are expected to launch around the end of March, which is also when Apple plans to release iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4. Apple is likely to hold a March event to introduce the new devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/">Apple to Launch Two iPad Air and Two OLED iPad Pro Models Early Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-two-ipad-air-and-two-oled-ipad-pro-models-early-next-year.2412987/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iMessage chat service may dodge EU regulatory demands for platform interoperability after all. <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/apple-imessage-set-to-avoid-eu-s-digital-dominance-crackdown">Bloomberg</a></em> reports that an investigation by the bloc's antitrust watchdog has tentatively concluded that the chat service is not popular enough with business users to warrant being subject to the new rules.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
The EU has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/01/dma-eu-law-could-force-major-changes-apple/">working on legislation</a> under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that would have required Apple to make changes to iMessage to make it available on other platforms. The rules will apply to tech giants that meet its "gatekeeper" criteria, force them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers.<br/>
<br/>
The interoperability rules theoretically mean that Meta apps like WhatsApp or Messenger could request to interoperate with Apple's iMessage framework, and Apple would be forced to comply within the EU. But today's report suggests iMessage may fall outside the legislation because it is not widely used by businesses.<br/>
<br/>
The report notes that the possible reprieve for Apple is part of a five-month market investigation by the European Commission, and Apple's exemption has not and will not be officially confirmed until the probe is completed in February.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of the investigation's conclusions, the DMA will likely still force Apple to make major changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> work in Europe.

		<description><![CDATA[Unidentified governments are surveilling smartphone users by tracking push notifications that move through Google's and Apple's servers, a US senator warned on Wednesday (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iOS-16-4-Web-Push.jpeg" alt="" width="794" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-885967" /><br/>
In a letter to the Department of Justice, Senator Ron Wyden said foreign officials were demanding the data from the tech giants to track smartphones. The traffic flowing from apps that send push notifications put the companies "in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps," Wyden said. He asked the Department of Justice to "repeal or modify any policies" that hindered public discussions of push notification spying.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement given to <em>Reuters</em>, Apple said that Wyden's letter gave them the opening they needed to share more details with the public about how governments monitored push notifications.<br/>
<blockquote>"In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information," the company said in a statement. "Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests."</blockquote>According to the report, Wyden's letter said a "tip" was the source of the information about the surveillance. A source familiar with the matter confirmed that both foreign and U.S. government agencies have been asking Apple and Google for metadata related to push notifications. The data is said to have been used to attempt to tie anonymous users of messaging apps to specific Apple or Google accounts.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Reuters</em>' source would not identify which governments were making the data requests but described them as "democracies allied to the United States." They did not know how long the requests had been going on for. <br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification">advises developers</a> not to include sensitive data in notifications and to encrypt any data before adding it to a notification payload. However, this requires action on the developers' part. Likewise, metadata (like which apps are sending notifications and how often) is not encrypted, potentially giving anyone with access to the information insight into users' app usage.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/privacy/">Privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/apple-governments-surveil-push-notifications/">Apple Confirms Governments Using Push Notifications to Surveil Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-governments-using-push-notifications-to-surveil-users.2412959/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has told component suppliers it wants iPhone 16 batteries to be made in India, as part of the company's efforts to diversify its global supply chain and reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-battery-kosutami.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923492" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Leaked image of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/">alleged iPhone 16 Pro battery</a> with new design, updated connector, and 3355mAh capacity.</em></div><br/>
The <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1eee7956-a5be-4df0-a9a9-139c573c4f8f">Financial Times</a></em> reports that Apple has informed battery suppliers including China's Desay and Taiwan's Simplo Technology of its preference to have batteries for next year's iPhone made in India, and has encouraged the manufacturers to establish new factories there or scale up production at existing sites for future orders.<br/>
<br/>
"If all goes well with iPhone 16 battery supply, Apple plans to move more iPhone battery production to India," said one of the people close to Apple who spoke to <em>FT</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already works with Foxconn, Pegatron, and Tata (new owner of Wistron) to manufacture iPhones in India, with Foxconn handling 75 to 80 percent of the device assembly. Foxconn has invested more than &#36;500 million in India to ramp up its manufacturing capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/iphone-17-assembly-india/">believes</a> that 12 to 14 percent of global ‌iPhone‌ shipments are made in India, with that proportion to increase to 20 to 25 percent by 2024. Introductory production on the standard iPhone 17 will start in India in the second half of 2025, according to Kuo, marking the first time that Apple begins development of a new ‌iPhone‌ outside of China.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to allowing Apple to move manufacturing away from China, increasing production in India provides Apple with an opportunity to strengthen its relationship with the Indian government. India is a key market for Apple due to growing demand for Apple products in the country.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/make-iphone-16-batteries-in-india-apple/">Make iPhone 16 Batteries in India, Apple Tells Component Suppliers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/make-iphone-16-batteries-in-india-apple-tells-component-suppliers.2412953/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://ee.co.uk/tv/apple-tv-4k">EE TV</a>, a new broadband TV platform from EE, today launched as a BT TV replacement service in the UK, offering subscribers the option of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K with customized remote control.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ee-tv-apple-tv-4k.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925395" /><br/>
EE TV offers access to more than 70 Freeview channels, a Netflix subscription, as well as premium channels from Sky, Discovery, Eurosport, TNT Sports, and more.<br/>
<br/>
To access the platform, subscribers can opt to receive one of three set-top boxes: A standard EE TV "mini" box, a "pro" EE TV box that includes a hard drive for recording live TV, or – in what EE is calling a "UK-first" – a bespoke &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K set up for EE TV content consumption.<br/>
<br/>
Made in partnership with Apple, the custom &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K features a streamlined setup process and the EE TV app preinstalled, featuring live streaming and on-demand content, with quick access to live channels and third-party apps such as BBC iPlayer, as well as a unified search to find content across multiple platforms. The &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; also comes with a custom EE-branded remote including a special TV guide button and channel rockers.<br/>
<br/>
The EE TV boxes offer a similar hub that combines live broadcast TV, access to UK catch-up and on demand apps, and the ability to buy and rent content, but they lack access to the other services that &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; typically provides. Those new to EE TV are also eligible to six months of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> for free. <br/>
<br/>

All 24-month contracts come with live free-to-air channels and catchup. The platform also offers a range of additional services and premium channel packages, priced between £4.99 and £76, with customers able to flexibly add or remove packages from month to month. EE also offers subscribers a bonus EE TV Box Mini for "free multi-room TV." For more information, see the <a href="https://ee.co.uk/tv/apple-tv-4k">EE website</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Korean suppliers have begun developing smartphone under-display cameras (UDC), paving the way for the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a true "all-screen" appearance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793995" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=24568">The Elec</a></em>, LG Innotek has entered the preliminary development of the UDC, which sits under the display and does not result in a visible hole in the panel when the camera is not in use.<br/>
<br/>
A UPC differs from a typical front camera module, since it delivers less light to the image sensor. This is because light loss occurs as it passes through the display area before it reaches the camera lens, which can result in a deterioration in image quality and brightness.<br/>
<br/>
To compensate for this, LG Innotek is developing a special "freeform optic" multiple lens system that can reduce optical aberrations and increase the light intensity ratio around the optical module to improve peripheral image quality. LG Innotek has been publishing patents for the technology since December last year, and more are expected now that development has begun.<br/>
<br/>
LG Display, an affiliate of LG Innotek's LG Group, has also started UPC development, according to the report. LG Display aims to increase the UPC's light transmittance to 20% by 2023 and 40% after 2024, bringing it closer to the standard that Apple expects. Apple reportedly already received a UPC sample from an unnamed vendor, but rated it as unsatisfactory in performance.<br/>
<br/>
Before Apple uses the perfected under-screen camera technology, it is expected to adopt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">under-panel Face ID technology in 2025's iPhone 17 Pro</a>. This is expected to be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple will then adopt the UPC in 2027's "Pro" &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, according to respected analyst Ross Young of research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/">The Elec</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-under-display-camera/">&#039;All-Screen&#039; iPhone Under-Display Camera Enters Development</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-screen-iphone-under-display-camera-enters-development.2412943/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> gaming service with several new titles, including <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/disney-dreamlight-valley/id6456945575">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sonic-dream-team/id1609094795">Sonic Dream Team</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/puzzle-dragons-story/id1636844853">Puzzle & Dragons Story</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/turmoil/id6446276883">Turmoil+</a>.<br/>

Disney Dreamlight Valley is a life simulation game starring Disney characters, and it has previously been available on console platforms. The &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; version of the game includes the base version and the A Rift in Time expansion that is a paid option on other platforms.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to other versions of the game, the &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; version does not have in-app purchases and thus does not include Star Path seasons or the Premium Shop.<br/>
<br/>
Sonic Dream Team is a racing game that stars popular Sonic characters, while Puzzle &amp; Dragons Story is an RPG adventure match-3 game. Turmoil+ is an oil rush simulation game that tasks players with digging oil to make money and grow the nearby town.<br/>
<br/>
Many of these games were <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/8-new-games-and-more-than-50-updates-coming-to-apple-arcade-this-holiday-season/">announced back in November</a> following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">October price increase</a> to the &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; service. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; now costs &#36;6.99 per month in the United States, up from &#36;4.99 per month. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; games are free from all in-app purchases and ads.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-arcade-game-additions-december-2023/">Apple Arcade Gains Disney Dreamlight Valley, Puzzle &amp; Dragons Story, and Sonic Dream Team</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-arcade-gains-disney-dreamlight-valley-puzzle-dragons-story-and-sonic-dream-team.2412925/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adventure game "Stray," which is designed to let players take on the role of a daring orange cat, is available for download on the Mac as of today.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="STRAY Launch Trailer" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4uP2MyUL49s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Though the game was first released in 2022, it has been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation and Xbox consoles until today.<br/>
<br/>
In this third-person adventure title, a stray cat's curiosity causes him to get stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria, and the aim in the game is to get back up to the surface using B-12, the cat's drone companion.<br/>
<br/>
Stray asks players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding security bots and evil bacteria. The game is platform-based, so players will need to climb up various obstacles and interact with the environment to open up new pathways.<br/>
<br/>
Since the main character is a cat, players can sneak, sleep, meow at robots, and nuzzle up to NPCs. Stray is limited to Apple silicon Macs, and it uses Metal Upscaling for accelerated graphics performance and high-quality visuals.<br/>
<br/>
Stray can be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stray/id6451498949?mt=12">downloaded from the Mac App Store</a> for &#36;30.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/stray-apple-silicon-macs/">Popular Adventure Game &#039;Stray&#039; Now Available for Apple Silicon Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/popular-adventure-game-stray-now-available-for-apple-silicon-macs.2412922/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The first version of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; came out in March 2016, which means it has been seven years since it launched.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iphone-se-2016.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925333" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; was sold until September 2018, so it has been five years since it was last available for sale, making it eligible for Apple's vintage designation. Products are marked as vintage five years after the device was last sold by Apple, while products are marked as obsolete at the seven year point.<br/>
<br/>
Vintage devices are not guaranteed to be eligible for repairs through Apple or Apple Authorized Service Providers, though Apple will offer repairs if the parts are available.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has continued on with the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; line, and today, it continues to be the only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> fingerprint sensor. There have been three generations released to date, with the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3 introduced in March 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Apple today has also marked the second-generation 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> as vintage, as well as the special edition Mickey Solo3 Wireless headphones. The Powerbeats 2 and Solo2 Wireless headphones are now considered obsolete.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-original-iphone-se-vintage/">Apple&#039;s First iPhone SE Now Considered Vintage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-iphone-se-now-considered-vintage.2412918/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 17.2 addresses a bug that was preventing some iPhones from wirelessly charging on the wireless charging pads included in some vehicles, according to Apple's release notes for the iOS 17.2 RC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">that came out today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-wireless-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1005" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-788160" /><br/>
There <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-15-gm-charging-issue/">have been multiple complaints</a> from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> owners who have had charging issues in their Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Buick vehicles. In some of these cars, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> placed on the wireless charging pad would either not charge at all or start to charge and then stop.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the complaints were from &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; owners, and came after the iOS 17.1 update. General Motors said in November that it was aware of an issue and investigating the problem.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second charging-related bug fix that Apple has implemented in recent weeks. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/">iOS 17.1.1 update</a> that came out in early November addressed an issue that caused some &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models charged in BMW vehicles to lose NFC functionality.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 is expected to see a public release next week. The update also adds the Journal app, a Translate Action button option for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, new features in Messages, Weather and Clock widgets, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">and more</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-wireless-charging-bug-fix/">iOS 17.2 Fixes Bug Preventing Wireless Charging From Working in Some Vehicles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-fixes-bug-preventing-wireless-charging-from-working-in-some-vehicles.2412907/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new firmware update for both the Lightning and USB-C versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2. The new firmware is version 6B34, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/airpods-pro-2-firmware-6b32/">6B32 firmware</a> introduced in November.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware beyond "bug fixes and other improvements," so it is unclear what's new in the update, but prior software releases have been refining functionality introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> such as Adaptive Audio.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not give customers instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">iOS 17.2</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-rc-to-developers/">watchOS 10.2</a>, Siri can access data from the Health app for health and fitness queries, according to Apple's release notes for the updates, which are currently in beta. For the Apple Watch, this functionality is limited to the Series 9 and Ultra 2, as these are the only models that support on-device Siri processing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iOS-17-Health-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906604" /><br/>
For example, Apple says users can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, ask about the progress of closing their Activity rings for the day, or ask about their blood glucose level if they have a connected monitor.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2142151/ios-17-2-watchos-10-2-siri-health-features.html"><em>Macworld</em> shared</a> examples of supported queries:<ul><li>How many steps have I taken today?</li><br/>
<li>How many steps have I taken this week?</li><br/>
<li>What's my heart rate?</li><br/>
<li>What's my blood oxygen level?</li><br/>
<li>Check my Exercise ring.</li><br/>
<li>How does my Move ring look today?</li><br/>
<li>What's my average walking heart rate?</li><br/>
<li>How many calories have I burned?</li></ul>On the Apple Watch, health data is limited to the previous week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Siri is also gaining the ability to log data in the Health app. <em>Macworld</em> shared another list with examples of supported queries:<ul><li>My weight is 195.3 pounds.</li><br/>
<li>I started spotting today.</li><br/>
<li>I've taken my 6 pm medications.</li><br/>
<li>My body temperature is 98.5 degrees.</li><br/>
<li>My period started today.</li><br/>
<li>My blood sugar is 143.</li><br/>
<li>Record my blood pressure as 118 over 76.</li></ul>This functionality must be enabled first to work. On the iPhone, open the Settings app and select Health → Data Access & Devices → Siri, and then toggle on "Access Health Data." On the Apple Watch, open the Settings app and select Health → Apps and Services → Siri, and then toggle on "Allow Siri Access to Health Data."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.2 update that Apple is set to release to the public in the near future will bring support for the next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models. Qi2 was mentioned in the release notes for the RC version of the update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">that came out today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911511" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/magsafe-blue-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
With the addition of support for the new standard, &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; models will work with Qi2 wireless chargers. Qi2 is a next-generation Qi wireless charging technology that incorporates a Magnetic Power Profile. Qi2 devices will work like accessories that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, using magnets for alignment and speedier charging. Apple added Qi2 support to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models ahead of release, so they are already compatible with the standard.<br/>
<br/>
The Magnetic Power Profile was designed based on ‌&zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;‌ contributions from Apple, and it is being combined with the new Extended Power Profile (EPP) to form what is considered "Qi2." Qi2 is meant to ensure that phones and other battery-powered mobile products are perfectly aligned with chargers for improved energy efficiency and faster charging. It will allow for new accessories that would not be chargeable wirelessly using existing flat surface-to-flat surface devices.<br/>

While Qi2 chargers will be able to charge devices at up to 15W, it is not yet clear if Apple's iPhones will support faster wireless charging speeds with Qi2 accessories. For the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, for example, Apple's technical specifications page says that the devices still support Qi wireless charging "up to 7.5W" despite the fact that they work with Qi2.<br/>
<br/>
The first Qi2 accessories are set to launch during the holiday season.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qi2/">Qi2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-qi-iphone-13-14-models/">iOS 17.2 Brings Qi2 Support to iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-brings-qi2-support-to-iphone-13-and-iphone-14-models.2412896/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate versions (RCs) of upcoming iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-releases-ios-17-2-beta-4/">the fourth betas of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>.
