		<description><![CDATA[The United States Commerce Department today announced a significant financial commitment to Apple chip supplier TSMC to make more chips in the U.S. (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-08/tsmc-gets-11-6-billion-in-us-grants-loans-for-three-chip-fabs?embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
The White House shared a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/08/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-chips-and-science-act-preliminary-agreement-with-tsmc/">statement</a> explaining that the U.S. Commerce Department will allocate a &#36;6.6 billion subsidy to TSMC for the advancement of semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona. TSMC will also receive &#36;5 billion in loans and be eligible to claim an investment tax credit of up to 25% of capital expenditures. The move is part of a larger initiative under the CHIPS and Science Act, which aims to rejuvenate the United States' semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC has already committed to an escalated investment of &#36;25 billion, elevating its total investment to &#36;65 billion. This is the largest foreign direct investment in a completely new project in U.S. history.<br/>
<br/>
The chipmaker also announced plans to construct a third fabrication plant in Arizona by 2030. The first TSMC plant in Arizona will start producing 4nm chips next year. The second plant, which was originally designed to make <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> chips, will also make 2nm ones by 2028. The third plant will produce 2nm chips with capacity to make even more advanced semiconductors in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's most advanced chips are currently made in Taiwan using TSMC's &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; process, so the ability to make these chips and even more powerful ones in the future in the United States could represent a significant future shift in the company's supply chain.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/08/tsmc-to-step-up-u-s-production/">Apple Chipmaker TSMC to Receive &#36;6.6 Billion Grant to Step Up Production in the U.S.</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-chipmaker-tsmc-to-receive-6-6-billion-grant-to-step-up-production-in-the-u-s.2423753/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following a few notable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/06/best-buys-weekend-sale-macbook/">discounts on MacBooks</a> yesterday, Best Buy today introduced a sale on the 10th generation iPad, including numerous all-time low prices on the tablet. Prices start at <a href="https://howl.me/clZOtQn87MI"><strong>&#36;349.00</strong></a> for the 64GB Wi-Fi model, and include &#36;100 markdowns on both Wi-Fi and cellular devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Deals-2.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893586" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy.

		<description><![CDATA[A future Apple TV box could have a built-in camera for FaceTime and other video calling apps, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-07/apple-aapl-future-products-could-include-robots-and-smart-home-push-lupinmna"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">tvOS 17 added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device.<br/>
<br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-07/apple-aapl-future-products-could-include-robots-and-smart-home-push-lupinmna"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said an Apple TV with a camera would support "gesture-based controls," but he did not provide any additional details. Starting with updates like iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, and tvOS 17, you can make hand gestures during video calls in the FaceTime app and other video calling apps to fill the screen with 3D effects. For example, you can hold two thumbs up to show fireworks on the screen, or make two peace signs with your hands to show confetti. It is unclear if Gurman is referring to this feature, or if there would be all-new gesture-based controls for tvOS overall.<br/>
<br/>
In other home-related news, Gurman said Apple has also considered a "lightweight smart display" that could be used around the house. <br/>
<br/>
Here's everything he said about these devices:<blockquote>Then there's the smart home segment, where Apple still has grand ambitions. It has discussed automating household functions and offering a revamped Apple TV set-top box with a built-in camera for FaceTime videoconferencing and gesture-based controls. And the technology will all work seamlessly with both the iPhone and Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
One piece of the strategy is a lightweight smart display — something akin to a low-end iPad. Such a device could be shuttled from room to room as needed and hooked into charging hubs stationed around the house. Apple has started small-scale test production of the screens for this product, but hasn't made a decision on whether to move forward.</blockquote>It is unclear if or when these devices will be released. Gurman previously reported that a new Apple TV would be released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">in the first half of 2024</a>, but it is unclear if a camera would be added to that particular model, or if it is still further away.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">Apple TV With Camera Again Rumored After tvOS 17 Added FaceTime</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored-after-tvos-17-added-facetime.2423713/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While rumors have been focused on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/gurman-new-ipads-first-week-of-may/">new iPad Pro and iPad Air models</a>, some Apple customers are wondering when the next iPad mini will be released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPad-Mini-6-YouTubed-2.jpg" alt="" width="2397" height="1348" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-814228" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-07/apple-aapl-future-products-could-include-robots-and-smart-home-push-lupinmna"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-07/apple-aapl-future-products-could-include-robots-and-smart-home-push-lupinmna"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> said new iPad mini and entry-level iPad models will be released in late 2024 at the earliest. <br/>
<br/>
"The company is also working on new versions of the low-end iPad and iPad mini, but those won't be coming before the end of the year at the earliest," he said. "The new downscale iPad will probably end up being a cost-reduced version of the 10th generation model from 2022, while the iPad mini update won't include much more than a processor upgrade."<br/>
<br/>
The current sixth-generation iPad mini was released in September 2021, and it is equipped with an A15 Bionic chip. Gurman expects the next model to feature a newer chip, but few other changes. Additional features rumored by other sources include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apples-2024-ipad-mini-all-the-rumors-so-far/">camera upgrades and a fix for the "jelly scrolling" display behavior</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The low-end iPad was last updated in October 2022. An eleventh-generation iPad could start at a lower price than the 10th-generation iPad, which could pave the way for Apple to discontinue the ninth-generation iPad with the Lightning connector.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/when-to-expect-next-ipad-mini/">When to Expect the Next iPad Mini and Low-End iPad Models to Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-to-expect-the-next-ipad-mini-and-low-end-ipad-models-to-launch.2423710/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<h3>PS5</h3><br/>
Sony's PlayStation 5 Slim console launched last November and Best Buy and other retailers have been hosting solid deals on the hardware for a few weeks now. At Best Buy, you can get the PS5 Slim (Disc Edition) Spider-Man 2 Bundle for <a href="https://howl.me/clUh1erQcL6"><strong>&#36;449.99</strong></a>, down from its launch price of &#36;499.99.<br/>
<br/>
The PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) Spider-Man 2 Bundle is available for <a href="https://howl.me/clUh0j2gc8v"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;449.99. Sony increased the price of the Digital Edition by &#36;50 at the launch of the new Slim consoles, so this deal effectively brings the price back down to the level of the original PS5 Digital Edition.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clUh1erQcL6"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>PS5 Slim Spider-Man 2 Bundle for &#36;449.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Both bundles also include the Spider-Man 2 game as a digital download, which is an extra value worth &#36;69.99 when not on sale. You can also find video game gift cards on sale at Best Buy this week, as well as Nintendo Switch consoles and games.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>TVs</h3><br/>
A highlight of the TV sale at Best Buy is a new offer that includes a free 65-inch class Samsung 4K TV, and free installation, when you purchase select Samsung TVs. Additionally, My Best Buy Plus/Total members can save &#36;100 on these TVs. You can <a href="https://howl.me/clYYgUPB85H">find the full list of eligible TVs</a> on Best Buy's website.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clYYnahAKDc"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">SITEWIDE SALE</div>Best Buy TV Deals</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are many more deals on TVs beyond Samsung, including big savings on LG, TCL, Sony, Hisense, and Insignia. Many of these deals are available to all shoppers, but some do require a My Best Buy Plus/Total membership in order to see the all-time low prices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[We're still two months away from the unveiling of iOS 18 at WWDC, so Apple is pushing forward with the first beta of new iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 updates likely to be officially released next month. These updates are smaller in scale than the recent 17.4 updates, but we're still finding some interesting changes in them.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/top-stories-6apr2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945110" /><br/>
Meanwhile, the wait for new iPads continues, and it appears we've got around another month before we'll see them released. Other news this week included a iPhone 16 display rumor, details on upcoming Beats Solo 4 headphones, and the release of more immersive spatial Personas for Apple Vision Pro, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Here's Everything New in iOS 17.5 Beta 1</h2><br/>
Apple this week made the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-ios-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">first betas of iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5</a> available to developers and public beta testers. The upcoming software updates include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/everything-new-in-ios-17-5-beta-1/">only a few new user-facing features</a> for the iPhone and iPad so far, but hidden code changes reveal some additional possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943813" /><br/>
We have put together a list of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/everything-new-in-ios-17-5-beta-1/">everything discovered in the first iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 betas</a>, including code changes related to a Battery Health menu coming to the iPad, a new Apple Pencil, and more.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 will likely be released to the public in May.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 Rumored to Feature Even Thinner Bezels</h2><br/>
For the second time in as many months, it has been rumored that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/">at least some iPhone 16 models will feature even thinner bezels around the screen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-lineup-Action-button-230912.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910375" /><br/>
The higher-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to feature larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, but the thinner bezels could result in the devices having only modestly larger dimensions compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Suppliers Say New iPads Have Been 'Repeatedly Postponed'</h2><br/>
It has been <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">nearly 18 months since Apple last updated its iPad lineup</a>, and customers are anxiously waiting for new models to be announced. For months, there have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">rumors about new iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-ipad-air/">iPad Air models</a>, but the estimated timeframe for their release has been repeatedly pushed back from March to April <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">to May</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
In defense of these rumors, it does sound like the new iPads have indeed experienced delays, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-suppliers-say-new-ipads-repeatedly-postponed/">some Apple suppliers say production of related components has been "repeatedly postponed."</a><br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPadOS 17.5 Beta Hints at Battery Capacity and Cycle Count Menu on Upcoming iPads</h2><br/>
Apple may be planning to expand the iPhone's Battery Health menu to upcoming iPads, based on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/">evidence uncovered in the iPadOS 17.5 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPad-Battery-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1990" height="1120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944716" /><br/>
The first iPadOS 17.5 beta includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/">several new references to a Battery Health menu on the iPad</a>, but the feature is not actually visible yet, and it may be exclusive to upcoming iPads. The menu is expected to show an iPad battery's maximum remaining capacity and cycle count.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Beats Solo 4 to Feature Improved Sound, USB-C</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/new-beats-solo-4-to-feature-improved-sound-usb-c/">New features and details for the rumored Beats Solo 4</a> surfaced this week, shortly after the headphones appeared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-beats-solo-4-headphones/">in the FCC database</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/new-beats-solo-4.jpg" alt="" width="1129" height="635" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938522" /><br/>
Key features expected for the Beats Solo 4 include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/new-beats-solo-4-to-feature-improved-sound-usb-c/">improved sound quality, a USB-C charging port, and up to 50 hours of battery life for music playback</a>. Like the Beats Solo 3 headphones that launched in 2016, the Solo 4 are expected to cost &#36;199 in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Testing the Apple Vision Pro's New Spatial Personas Feature</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/spatial-personas-beta-coming-to-vision-pro/">Spatial Personas are now available on Apple's Vision Pro headset</a> in beta capacity. The feature is available on visionOS 1.1 and later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/New-Spatial-Persona-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944685" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/testing-vision-pro-spatial-persona/">recent video</a> on our YouTube channel, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/testing-vision-pro-spatial-persona/">tested the new spatial Personas</a>, which "break out of the familiar FaceTime tile and feel more present" in the visionOS space compared to the standard Personas that have been available since day one, according to Apple.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">Apple Car canceled</a>, Apple is exploring new markets where it might be able to find new revenue streams, and personal robotics is apparently one area the company is investigating.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/roseytherobot.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945124" /><br/>
This guide highlights everything we know about Apple's interest in robotics, and we'll update it with new rumors going forward.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="the_robot_rumors">The Robot Rumors</h2><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is looking for its "next big thing," and robotics are one area of focus. Apple has engineering teams working on various in-home robotic devices and the AI software and functionality that might be able to make a home robot useful.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's work on robotics takes place in the hardware engineering division and in its AI and machine learning group under AI chief John Giannandrea.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="mobile_robot">Mobile Robot</h3><br/>
Apple is considering a mobile robot that would follow users around the home, presumably serving as something like an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> on wheels. A robot would likely be able to place <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls, monitor the home and the people in it, carry out simple tasks, and answer queries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be exploring AI algorithms that would be used to help robots navigate cluttered spaces in homes, and while Apple wants to design a robot that would clean and do chores much like Rosey in the Jetsons, it's too complicated for now. Gurman says that such a robot is unlikely this decade due to "extraordinarily difficult engineering challenges."<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="table-top_robot">Table-Top Robot</h3><br/>
Another Apple project is described as an "advanced table-top home device" where robotics are used to move a display around. The device, which is described as a robotic motor on a small stand, would mimic the head movements of a person on a &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; video call. It would be able to nod, or precisely lock on to a single person during a group &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; call. Gurman says that Apple has had some difficulty with weight and balance, and Apple is also not sure that consumers will pay "top dollar" for such a product.<br/>
<br/>
The robotic display is said to be further along than Apple's mobile robot, but it has been "added and removed from the company's product roadmap" several times over the years.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="secret_house_facility">Secret House Facility</h2><br/>
Apple reportedly has a secret facility that is designed to look like the inside of a home, and that's where it is testing future home products.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_home_devices">Other Home Devices</h2><br/>
There are some more realistic products that are in the works, with rumors suggesting that Apple is developing an iPad-like home hub device that would serve as a central way to control smart devices. Apple has also been rumored to be working on a version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> that integrates <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> speakers and a camera, and there have been rumors of a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apples_competition">Apple's Competition</h2><br/>
Amazon has <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FIntroducing-Amazon-Astro%2Fdp%2FB078NSDFSB">a &#36;1,600 "Astro" robot</a> that it sells by invitation. Astro is able to navigate the home and remotely check specific rooms, people, and things when the user is away from home.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Amazon-Astro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944747" /><br/>
The robot is able to send an alert if an unrecognized person is detected, or if there are sounds like an alarm. Astro has a built-in display and can be used for watching TV, placing calls, setting reminders, sending messages, and more. Astro uses Alexa, and Amazon suggests that it can be used to "remotely care for aging loved ones."<br/>
<br/>
Astro is also able to carry "a variety of accessories" such as a Ziploc container, a blood pressure monitor, and a Furbo Dog Camera that provides treats for a pet.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Living with aibo" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CdQnfga65W0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Sony has experimented with robots, and is best known for the <a href="https://us.aibo.com">Aibo robotic dog</a>. Priced at &#36;2900, Aibo is designed to act like a real dog with dynamic movements, lifelike expressions, curiosity, and an interest in human interaction. Aibo is able to learn tricks, play with toys, and listen to commands.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of other home robots on the market, but the best known may be the wide range of robot vacuums like the Roomba that are able to navigate the home to automatically clean up dust, dirt, pet fur, and other debris.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s163k_yoYi4" title="Introducing the Roomba Combo® Essential robot" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<h2 id="robot_launch_date">Robot Launch Date</h2><br/>
Apple's work on personal robotics is in the early stages, and the company has small teams that are exploring different concepts. It is not clear if some kind of robot will ever launch, and there is no word on when if so.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-robot/">Apple&#039;s Work on Robots: What We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-work-on-robots-what-we-know-so-far.2423632/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Apple design chief Jony Ive have officially teamed up to design an AI-powered personal device and are seeking funding, reports <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jony-ive-and-sam-altmans-ai-device-startup-in-funding-talks-with-emerson-thrive">The Information</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/jony-ive-ipad-pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1278" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-824160" /><br/>
Little is known about the AI device at this time, but it won't look like a smartphone. Altman is a major investor in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/humane-ai-pin/">the Humane AI pin</a>, a wearable AI device that does not have a screen, so it's possible he will create a similar product with Ive.<br/>
<br/>
News of a possible partnership between Ive and Altman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/jony-ive-openai-design-ai-hardware/">first surfaced last fall</a>, but talks were in the early stages and nothing was official then. Ive and Altman's unnamed startup is now sourcing funds from major venture capitalists, with Ive aiming to raise up to &#36;1 billion in funding.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Disney plans to start cracking down on Disney+ password sharing starting in June, Disney CEO Bob Iger said in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/04/04/disney-ceo-bob-iger-on-streaming-we-have-to-turn-it-into-a-growth-business.html">interview with <em>CNBC</em></a> earlier this week. Iger said that Disney needs to turn its streaming business into a growth business, and one way to do that is to force households that are sharing passwords to sign up for their own accounts.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787884" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/disney-plus.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1215" /><br/>
"In June, we'll be launching our first real foray into password sharing," said Iger. "Just a few countries and a few markets, but then it will grow significantly with a full rollout in September."<br/>
<br/>
Iger did not clarify where the password sharing lockdown will start, but it sounds like it will be largely worldwide when September rolls around.<br/>
<br/>
Disney+ competitor Netflix put a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/24/netflix-starts-password-sharing-crackdown/">stop to multi-household password</a> sharing in 2023, and it ended up being a major revenue driver for the company. Netflix saw <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-pace/">strong subscriber growth</a>, gaining 8.8 million new subscribers in Q3 2023 after cracking down on password sharing.<br/>
<br/>
Iger said that he admires what Netflix has done, calling the company the "gold standard in streaming."<br/>
<blockquote>Netflix is the gold standard in streaming. They've done a phenomenal job in a lot of different directions. I actually have very, very high regard for what they've accomplished. If we can only accomplish what they've accomplished, that would be great.</blockquote><br/>
Disney+ launched in 2019, and since then it has grown into the number two streaming service in terms of subscribers after Netflix. Prior to when Iger returned to Disney 2022, Disney+ was bleeding money as Disney focused on subscriber growth. Disney+ will see its first profitable quarter in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 under Iger's leadership.<br/>
<br/>
Disney's streaming service has more than 110 million subscribers worldwide, and it has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/11/disney-plus-hulu-combo-app/">integrating Hulu content</a> into Disney+ in order to boost customer engagement. Disney+ is now priced at &#36;10.99 per month for an ad-free subscription, or &#36;7.99 for a subscription with ads.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/">Disney Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown/">Disney+ Password Sharing Crackdown to Start in June</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-password-sharing-crackdown-to-start-in-june.2423626/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Batterygate: iPhone Users in Canada Can Now Submit Claims for Up to &#36;150 Payout From Apple</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple agreed to pay up to &#36;14.4 million (CAD) to settle a class action lawsuit in Canada that alleged the company secretly throttled the performance of some iPhone models ("batterygate"), and eligible customers <a href="https://www.smartphoneperformancesettlement.ca/en/claim">can now submit a claim</a> for payment.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-6s-MacRumors-YouTube.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929156" /><br/>
Apple's settlement <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-iphone-battery-settlement-approved-in-canada/">received court approval</a> on March 4, and the claims period began today, according to law firm Rochon Genova LLP. To submit a claim, visit the <a href="https://www.smartphoneperformancesettlement.ca/">settlement website</a>, select <a href="https://www.smartphoneperformancesettlement.ca/en/claim">"Submit a Claim"</a> in the top menu, and follow the steps. A serial number for an eligible iPhone is required. The deadline to submit a claim is September 2.<br/>
<br/>
Each affected customer will receive a payment of between &#36;17.50 (CAD) and &#36;150 (CAD) from Apple per valid claim submitted, with the exact payout amount to be dependent on the total number of claims submitted.<br/>
<br/>
To be eligible, you must be a current or former resident of Canada (excluding Québec) who owns or owned an iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and/or iPhone SE with iOS 10.2.1 or later installed or downloaded, and/or an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 11.2 or later installed or downloaded, before December 21, 2017.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has denied all of the allegations as described in the lawsuit, and the settlement does not represent an admission of fault. The settlement allows for Apple to avoid the additional time and costs involved with continued litigation.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was sued in multiple Canadian provinces over iPhone battery throttling in 2018, including Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. The cases were filed shortly after Apple revealed that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/">started throttling the maximum performance of some iPhone models with "chemically aged" batteries</a>, when necessary, to prevent the devices from unexpectedly shutting down. Apple introduced this power management system in iOS 10.2.1, but it initially failed to mention the change in that update's release notes, leading to public outcry. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/">Apple eventually apologized</a> about its lack of transparency, and temporarily lowered the price of iPhone battery replacements to &#36;35 (CAD) until the end of 2018.<br/>
<br/>
Apple agreed to pay up to &#36;500 million (USD) to settle a similar class action lawsuit in the U.S., and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/06/apple-starts-iphone-batterygate-payouts/">payments started going out in January</a> there.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/">iPhone Slowdown</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/iphone-batterygate-claims-open-in-canada/">Batterygate: iPhone Users in Canada Can Now Submit Claims for Up to &#36;150 Payout From Apple</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/batterygate-iphone-users-in-canada-can-now-submit-claims-for-up-to-150-payout-from-apple.2423623/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Updates App Store Guidelines to Permit Game Emulators, Website Links in EU Music Apps</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store guidelines</a> to comply with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">anti-steering mandate</a> levied by the European Commission. Music streaming apps like Spotify are now permitted to include a link or buy button that leads to a website with information about alternative music purchasing options, though this is only permitted <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/music-streaming-services-entitlement-eea/">in the European Economic Area</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><blockquote>Music Streaming Services Entitlements: music streaming apps in specific regions can use Music Streaming Services Entitlements to include a link (which may take the form of a buy button) to the developer's website that informs users of other ways to purchase digital music content or services. These entitlements also permit music streaming app developers to invite users to provide their email address for the express purpose of sending them a link to the developer's website to purchase digital music content or services. Learn more about these entitlements.<br/>
<br/>
In accordance with the entitlement agreements, the link may inform users about where and how to purchase those in-app purchase items, and the price of such items. The entitlements are limited to use only in the iOS or iPadOS App Store in specific storefronts. In all other storefronts, streaming music apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.</blockquote>The European Commission in March fined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">Apple &#36;2 billion</a> for anti-competitive conduct against rival music streaming services. The fine also came with a requirement that Apple "remove the anti-steering provisions" from its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules, which Apple has now done. Apple is restricted from repeating the infringement or adopting similar practices in the future, though it is worth noting that Apple plans to appeal the decision.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has accused Spotify of manipulating the European Commission to get the rules of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rewritten in its favor. "They want to use Apple's tools and technologies, distribute on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and benefit from the trust we've built with users - and pay Apple nothing for it," <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">Apple complained</a> following the ruling.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to updating its streaming music rules, Apple today also added games from retro game console emulator apps to the list of permitted software allowable under guideline 4.7. Guideline 4.7 permits apps to offer HTML5 mini apps and mini games, streaming games, chatbots, game emulators, and plug-ins.<blockquote>Apps may offer certain software that is not embedded in the binary, specifically HTML5 mini apps and mini games, streaming games, chatbots, and plug-ins. Additionally, retro game console emulator apps can offer to download games. You are responsible for all such software offered in your app, including ensuring that such software complies with these Guidelines and all applicable laws.</blockquote><br/>
Game emulators have managed to sneak onto the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; several times over the years by using hidden functionality, but Apple has not explicitly permitted them until now. The rule change that allows for game emulators is worldwide, as is support for apps that offer mini apps and mini games.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-review-guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">Apple Updates App Store Guidelines to Permit Game Emulators, Website Links in EU Music Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-updates-app-store-guidelines-to-permit-game-emulators-website-links-in-eu-music-apps.2423618/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Is a Screen Useful on AirPods? Check Out This Knockoff With a Display</title>

		<description><![CDATA[If you've ever wondered what it might be like to use AirPods with a display, well, a Chinese manufacturer made a fake version of the AirPods complete with a screen that we decided to test out. Would a touchscreen actually be worthwhile on AirPods?<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nuVsM08kZUs" title="Apple AirPods Ultra: AirPods With a Screen?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The display on the fake AirPods activates when the case is opened up. It shows connectivity status, the time, the battery level of each earbud, noise control options, "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>" settings, and equalizer presets. Other additions include customizable wallpaper, a flashlight, and a feature for controlling the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s camera.<br/>
<br/>
You're basically only able to control settings with the display, which is mildly useful. Actual AirPods need to be controlled through an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac, with some options available through the Control Center/Status Bar and others buried in the settings app.<br/>
<br/>
The touchscreen on the fake AirPods is, to put it politely, garbage. It doesn't register touches some of the time, the sound is mediocre, there are non-functional buttons, and the equalizer settings just make everything sound worse.<br/>
<br/>
So why did we buy these earbuds? Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/apple-airpods-case-with-touchscreen/">patented a similar concept back in 2021</a>, describing a set of AirPods with a built-in touchscreen display that can be used to manage settings and also control playback. In Apple's patent description, there are options for adjusting volume, favoriting songs, playing and pausing, skipping songs, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple suggested that the touchscreen could offer tactile feedback and provide a more convenient way to control wireless earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
We don't recommend counterfeit products, of course, so you should not go out and buy these. The fake AirPods do give us some idea of the utility of a touchscreen and how it could be used, which is interesting to imagine. Would you want an AirPods case with a touchscreen?

Apple is reportedly looking into personal robotics, such as a "mobile robot" that would "follow users around their homes" and an "advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around." In the long term, Apple apparently wants to create machines that can "handle chores, like cleaning dishes in a sink," but the robotics projects are said to be in the very early stages of research, and it is unclear if any of them will ever be released.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's CEO Tim Cook this week sold 196,410 shares of the company's stock, which had a total value of approximately &#36;33.2 million based on the average sale price of the transactions, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/b5c77d48-ad7d-4b61-bc72-2949d86b4d43.pdf">filing</a>. After taxes, Cook netted <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/accdf66b-4a6e-4bb1-b259-95a5f9a767cf.pdf">nearly &#36;16.4 million</a> from the sales.<br/>

Cook received all of the shares that he sold this week as a performance-based stock award. Like other senior executives at Apple, he has a predetermined trading plan to sell company stock in accordance with insider trading laws.<br/>
<br/>
Cook still owns nearly 3.3 million shares of Apple's stock following the sales, according to the filing. He has served as Apple's CEO since 2011.<br/>
<br/>
In 2015, <em>Fortune</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/26/tim-cook-post-jobs-era-fortune/">reported</a> that Cook planned to "give away all his wealth."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting on July 1, 2024, it will no longer be possible to spend an Apple ID balance in Singapore, according to an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118602">Apple support document</a> spotted by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a>. Apple did not provide an explanation for this decision, but it appears to relate to new regulations introduced by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. In general, gift cards are frequently involved in scams that defraud people.<br/>

Apple says that any App Store & iTunes gift cards added to an Apple ID balance before July 1 can still be used toward digital purchases until that deadline.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will issue refunds to customers with a remaining Apple ID balance after the deadline:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>After spending your balance is no longer possible, Apple will begin to automatically issue refunds for any remaining Apple ID balance to users in Singapore. If you have a balance, your money will be refunded to the default credit or debit card on file as a payment method for your Apple ID. You'll receive a confirmation email when Apple has processed your refund. Afterwards, it might take up to 30 days for your financial institution to show the refund in your account.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Apple already stopped selling gift cards in Singapore last year, and discontinuing Apple ID balances appears to be a related decision.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Store gift cards are unaffected by this change, and they can continue to be used at the three Apple Store locations in Singapore.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Yesterday, two unreleased Apple devices were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/new-ipad-models-spotted-in-regulatory-database/">discovered in Indian regulatory filings</a>. A further two models have now been spotted ahead of the expected announcement of new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models next month. <br/>
<br/>

The second wave of listings, spotted by <a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/new-ipad-a2898-a2899-bis-certification/"><em>MySmartPrice</em></a>, appears in the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) database with the model numbers A2898 and A2899. This joins the two models seen yesterday with the model numbers A2836 and A2837. All four model numbers do not correlate with any existing Apple devices, but four new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models are expected to launch next month: A 10.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, a 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, an 11.1-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and a 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
It is not clear whether A2898 and A2899 are new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, but both product lines are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">expected to be refreshed in May</a> following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-suppliers-say-new-ipads-repeatedly-postponed/">repeated delays</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week filed a required notice with the state of California, confirming plans to permanently lay off more than 600 employees. Under California law, employers must give employees and state representatives a 60-day notice before a mass layoff event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774150" /><br/>
The employees listed are located in several Apple-occupied buildings around Santa Clara, California, which is close to Apple's Cupertino headquarters. Several of these locations were rumored to be associated with Apple Car development in the past, so it is likely that these layoffs are related to Apple's decision to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">stop work on the car project</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple officially ended development on the Apple Car in March. Approximately 2,000 employees working on the Apple Car were told that the project was winding down at that time, and Apple began the process of moving some of them to work on artificial intelligence under John Giannandrea and in other relevant departments.<br/>
<br/>
Other employees were given 90 days to apply for open positions within the company, but Apple hired hardware engineers and car designers while working on the Apple Car, and these employees may not have had skills applicable to other projects.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-ends-microled-apple-watch-development/">recently ended development</a> on in-house microLED displays, so some of the layoffs might also be related to the decision to discontinue that work.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-employee-layoffs-car-project/">Apple Lays Off 600+ Employees After Canceling Car Project</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-lays-off-600-employees-after-canceling-car-project.2423567/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
