		<description><![CDATA[Chinese smartphone company OnePlus this week introduced its first foldable smartphone, the OnePlus Open. OnePlus joins several other manufacturers that have come out with foldable smartphones, including Samsung, Google, and Xiaomi. We picked up the OnePlus Open to see how it compares to Apple's latest flagship, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hE172rh7BDo" title="OnePlus Open: Best Foldable in 2023?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The OnePlus Open is similar to the Galaxy Fold in that it opens up like a book. When folded, the cover screen has a 6.31-inch display that's about in the middle of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max in terms of size. Unfolded, the display measures in at 7.82 inches, so a bit smaller than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>. The displays are OLED and support a 120Hz refresh rate, with OnePlus advertising a "Ceramic Guard" cover glass, which sounds almost identical to the Ceramic Shield that Apple uses.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/oneplus-open.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917966" /><br/>
When it comes to form factor, the OnePlus Open is nothing like the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max from Apple since Apple hasn't delved into foldable smartphones as of yet, but there are similar components inside. The OnePlus Open has a premium feel, and size wise, it's between the Z Fold5 and the Pixel Fold. It is able to fold down flat with a crease that's almost unnoticeable, plus it's thin and lightweight.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/oneplus-open-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917967" /><br/>
The Open is 11.7mm thick when it's folded in half, but when you open it up, it's 5.8mm. For comparison, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is 8.25mm thick. As for weight, it is 239 grams, or 18 grams heavier than the 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
OnePlus has a partnership with camera company Hasselblad, and it is using a 48-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 64-megapixel telephoto camera with 6x in-sensor lossless zoom, and a 48-megapixel ultra wide-angle camera. There's also a 20-megapixel front-facing selfie camera accessible when the OnePlus Open is unfolded, and a 32-megapixel selfie camera that can be used when it's closed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/oneplus-open-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917968" /><br/>
Design wise, the lenses are in a large circular housing at the back of the device, which OnePlus likens to a the face of a luxury watch. The lens housing is super massive, and it can be hard to get photos from some of the lenses without your fingers getting in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Other features include the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform, 16GB RAM, a fingerprint sensor power button, a 4,805mAh battery, and support for Wi-Fi 7.<br/>

The OnePlus Open is <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/open">available for pre-order</a> as of now, and it is set to launch on October 26. It is priced starting at &#36;1,700.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is unlikely to release any new Macs or iPads for the remainder of 2023, according to a series of predictions shared in recent weeks by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/apple-silicon-mac-lineup-wwdc-2022-feature-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878408" /><br/>
<h2>Macs</h2><br/>
<br/>
Last month, Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">unlikely to release any new MacBooks with the M3 chip</a> this year. All existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models are equipped with M2 series chips, so any new models would presumably be equipped with M3 chips, which effectively means that Kuo does not expect any new MacBooks at all for the rest of 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Kuo added that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">24-inch iMac would be updated next in 2024</a>, ruling out an update to the all-in-one desktop computer this year. All other desktop Macs, including the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, were already updated in 2023 and are highly unlikely to be updated again until 2024 or later.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Macs by Date Last Updated</h3><br/>
<ul><li><strong>15-inch MacBook Air:</strong> June 2023</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac Studio:</strong> June 2023</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac Pro:</strong> June 2023</li><br/>
<li><strong>14-inch MacBook Pro:</strong> January 2023</li><br/>
<li><strong>16-inch MacBook Pro:</strong> January 2023</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac mini:</strong> January 2023</li><br/>
<li><strong>13-inch MacBook Air:</strong> June 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>13-inch MacBook Pro:</strong> June 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>iMac:</strong> April 2021</li></ul><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
<h2>iPads</h2><br/>
<br/>
Last month, Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">unlikely to release any new iPad models</a> before the end of 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to release any new iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad mini, or entry-level iPad models this year. If that trend continues for the remainder of 2023 as expected, it would be the first calendar year with no new iPads released in the device's 13-year history.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>iPads by Date Last Updated</h3><br/>
<ul><li><strong>iPad Pro:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPad:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded a second release candidate (RC) version of iOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a few days after Apple seeded the first RC. The second release candidate is limited to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, and it won't be available for download on other devices. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912331" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the iOS 17.1 beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta. <br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 adds the option to favorite songs, albums, playlists, artists, and more, with favorited content added to the Library and used for suggestions. Favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen using the Now Playing widget, plus when starting a playlist, you'll now see Song Suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
AirDrop transfers can be finished over the internet so close proximity does not need to be maintained, and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 can now use NameDrop with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running iOS 17.1. On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, iOS 17.1 ensures you won't activate the Camera or Flashlight in your pocket.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include a flashlight indicator in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> for non &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, and a Wallet feature that lets U.S. Discover card users and those in the UK connect their banks to see balances and transactions. Apple's release notes for the update are below:<br/>
<blockquote><strong>AirDrop</strong><br/>
- Content continues to transfer over the internet when you step out of AirDrop range<br/>
<br/>
<strong>StandBy</strong><br/>
- New options to control when the display turns off (iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Music</strong><br/>
- Favorites expanded to include songs, albums, and playlists, and you can filter to display your favorites in the library<br/>
- New cover art collection offers designs that change colors to reflect the music in your playlist<br/>
- Song suggestions appear at the bottom of every playlist, making it easy to add music that matches the vibe of your playlist<br/>
<br/>
<strong>This update also includes the following improvements and bug fixes:</strong><br/>
- Option to choose a specific album to use with Photo Shuffle on the Lock Screen<br/>
- Home key support for Matter locks<br/>
- Improved reliability of Screen Time settings syncing across devices<br/>
- Fixes an issue that may cause the Significant Location privacy setting to reset when transferring an Apple Watch or pairing it for the first time<br/>
- Resolves an issue where the names of incoming callers may not appear when you are on another call<br/>
- Addresses an issue where custom and purchased ringtones may not appear as options for your text tone<br/>
- Fixes an issue that may cause the keyboard to be less responsive<br/>
- Crash detection optimizations (all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models)<br/>
- Fixes an issue that may cause display image persistence<br/>
<br/>
Some features may not be available for all regions or on all Apple devices.

Verizon has discounts on both models of the AirPods 3, priced at &#36;149.99 for the Lightning model and &#36;159.00 for the MagSafe model. These discounts are overall second-best prices on the AirPods 3, but we haven't tracked all-time low deals in months, so they're still good deals for anyone looking to purchase the AirPods 3 soon.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://findtuo.com/pages/smart-button">accessory company TUO</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> and a Matter-compatible TUO Smart Button to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/tuo-smart-button-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917945" /><br/>
<a href="https://findtuo.com/pages/smart-button">Priced at &#36;34.95</a>, TUO Smart Button is a simple accessory that is able to activate any of your home automations with the press of a button. TUO is the first Matter-certified Smart Button that supports Thread.<br/>
<br/>
With Matter integration, it can be added to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> setup so long as you have an Apple Matter hub, which includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 2, &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K. Thread allows for better connectivity and interaction with other Thread-enabled products as long as you have a Thread border router. In the &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; ecosystem, the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 2, &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;, and the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K (latest &#36;149 model) have Border router support, as do many other &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/tuo-smart-button-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917946" /><br/>
The Smart Button has a simple, straightforward design and it can be placed anywhere in the home. It comes with a magnetic wall plate and a set of stickers that you can add to denote what the button does. Because it's so compact (about an inch and a half), it is unassuming and blends well with decor.<br/>
<br/>
While there's a single button, it supports a total of three gestures, including a single press, a double press, and a long press. That means three separate actions or automations can be activated with the TUO Smart Button. According to TUO, the button can even be used as an "unofficial" doorbell when it's set up to play a sound on a connected smart speaker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/tuo-smart-button-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917947" /><br/>
Automations in &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; can encompass several actions, like turning off all of the lights in one room at a time, so the TUO Smart Button offers quite a bit of flexibility with the three button options. The entire top part of the TUO can be pressed down, so it is easy to activate your automations even with the small size of the device.<br/>
<br/>
The TUO Smart Button uses a CR2032 battery that is able to last around a year depending on how much the button is used. Aside from Thread, it is also able to connect to a &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; setup using Bluetooth. If you don't have &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj;, or have a home with multiple smart home platforms, the Smart Button also works with other Matter-supported systems.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTuber Luke Miani joins us on this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-future-of-ipad-ft-luke-miani/id1602394741?i=1000632024259">The MacRumors Show</a> to discuss the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> with USB-C, the direction of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup, and Vision Pro. <br/>

We talk through our immediate thoughts on Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">newly announced</a> &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; model featuring a USB-C port for pairing and charging, leading us to contemplate how to clean up the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup as a whole. We compare Apple's Vision Pro headset to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and consider whether it is destined for similar criticisms or if it truly offers more potential in the long-term. We also discuss the latest rumors about a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">foldable iPad</a>, which a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/foldable-ipad-now-in-intensive-development-could-be-announced-as-soon-as-late-2024/">recent report</a> suggested could be announced as soon as next year, and whether such a device could breathe new life into the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">announced a new lower-cost Apple Pencil</a> compatible with all iPad models equipped with a USB-C port. It launches in early November and will be sold alongside the original Apple Pencil and the second-generation Apple Pencil.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/8-New-Apple-Pencil-Features.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917933" /><br/>
<h2>Key Facts About the New Apple Pencil</h2><br/>
<ol><li>It has a similar design as the Apple Pencil 2, but with a USB-C port hidden under a sliding cap for charging and pairing over a USB-C cable.</li><br/>
<li>It is compatible with all iPad models equipped with a USB-C port.</li><br/>
<li>It attaches magnetically to compatible iPads, including the tenth-generation iPad, but it does not support wireless charging or wireless pairing.</li><br/>
<li>Unlike the Apple Pencil 2, the new model lacks pressure sensitivity on an iPad screen, a double-tap gesture for switching between drawing tools, and the option for personal engraving at the time of purchase.</li><br/>
<li>It supports the Apple Pencil hover feature when used with the latest iPad Pro models, released in October 2022.</li><br/>
<li>It weighs roughly the same as the Apple Pencil 2, but it is around 7% shorter.</li><br/>
<li>In the U.S., it costs &#36;79 for the general public and &#36;69 for students. This is cheaper than the first two generations of the Apple Pencil, which remain available for &#36;99 and &#36;129, respectively.</li><br/>
<li>It launches in early November. Apple has not provided a specific release date.</li></ol><h2>Apple Pencil Comparison Chart</h2><br/>

Members of the show's staff were informed about its end on Thursday, according to several people with knowledge of the situation, just a couple of weeks before episodes for the third season were scheduled to begin. <br/>
<br/>
The editorial disagreements reportedly revolved around some of the planned guests on "The Problem," as well as potential show topics related to China and artificial intelligence that were causing concern among Apple executives. Apple did not respond to <em>NYT</em>'s request for comment.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in 2020 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/27/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-series/">secured</a> a multi-year deal with the writer, producer, and former host of "The Daily Show", which saw Stewart return to television following his 2015 retirement. <br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro will revert to an LCD display instead of adopting OLED panel technology, claims a controversial new report coming out of Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ipad-pro-red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906242" /><br/>
It has been widely reported that Apple's next iPad Pro models will be the first Apple tablets to debut superior OLED panels, with rumors suggesting they will begin shipping <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/ipad-pro-oled-display-mass-production-early-2024/">around the middle of next year</a>. That's not necessarily the case, according to a confusing new <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231019PD217/apple-led-display-panel-mobile-devices-pc-ce.html">DigiTimes</a></em> report. <br/>
<br/>
The Taiwan-based outlet now claims Apple will in fact revert to using LCD backlighting for its upcoming 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, putting it on par with the existing 11-inch model. <br/>
<br/>
The current 12.9-inch iPad Pro features a mini-LED display that Apple calls a "Liquid Retina XDR display," while the 11-inch variant uses an inferior LCD-based "Liquid Retina Display."  <br/>
<br/>
The report alleges that the high production cost of using mini-LED backlights in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro has been a "hurdle for broader industry adoption," and that Apple's pivot back to conventional backlight technology "could be motivated by the company's focus on scalability and market penetration." <br/>
<br/>
As a result of the component changes, production of the new 12.9-inch iPads could be postponed to "early 2024 at the latest," having originally been slated to start in "early November," adds <em>DigiTimes</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Several things don't add up in this latest report. As covered previously by <em>MacRumors</em>, ‌<em>DigiTimes</em> on Thursday alluded to the same report in its "Before Going to Press" section by claiming that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/">forthcoming 12.9-inch iPad Air may feature LCD backlighting</a> as opposed to the mini-LED backlighting used in the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro.<br/>
<br/>
However, the fully published report no longer mentions this alleged larger "12.9-inch iPad Air," and simply makes a passing reference to "a new iPad Air" that will also use traditional LCD backlighting like the next iPad Pro.<br/>
<br/>
To add to the confusion, the full article appears to contradict itself by repeating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/23/apple-oled-ipad-panels-samsung-lg-2024/">widely reported</a> claims that "Apple might launch a new iPad Pro with AMOLED displays earliest in 2024, sourcing mainly from Samsung Display and LG Display." Whether the OLED model is meant to be in addition to the alleged 12.9-inch iPad Pro with LCD display previously mentioned is simply not specified. <br/>
<br/>
Leaving aside the inconsistencies in the above claims, if the next 12.9-inch iPad Pro reverted from mini-LED to traditional LCD panel technology, it would be considered a major regression for Apple's most premium tablet offering, especially given that OLED display technology is perhaps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/2024-ipad-pro-what-to-expect/">the most anticipated upgrade</a> coming to the next-generation ‌iPad Pro‌ models. <br/>
<br/>
Given the contradictions in <em>DigiTimes</em>' reporting, not to mention its history for misinterpreting supply chain information, this claim alone should be taken with a large grain of salt until other sources can corroborate it. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/2024-ipad-pro-lcd-panel-not-oled-or-mini-led/">2024 iPad Pro to Use LCD Panel Instead of OLED or Mini-LED, Claims Sketchy Report</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2024-ipad-pro-to-use-lcd-panel-instead-of-oled-or-mini-led-claims-sketchy-report.2408159/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the explosive popularity of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, there have been rumors that Apple is working on its own AI product, and that some kind of "Apple GPT" artificial intelligence bot could launch in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840591" /><br/>
This guide highlights everything we know about Apple's experiments with AI, and it will be updated regularly as new rumors come out.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="internal_testing_and_development">Internal Testing and Development</h2><br/>
Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea is leading development on large language models within Apple, and Giannandrea reports directly to Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>. Giannandrea <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">established a team</a> that works on conversational AI four years ago, and work has since ramped up.<br/>
<br/>
For the last several months, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-experimenting-with-chatgpt-tool/">has been testing</a> an "Apple GPT" rival that could compete with ChatGPT. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, work on AI is a priority for Apple, with the company designing an "Ajax" framework for large language models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has an internal chatbot that some engineers have been referring to as "Apple GPT," but Apple would not, of course, ever use that naming for a consumer product. Apple employees need special permission to use the chatbot, and its output cannot be used to develop new product features for customers. It is used for product prototyping and it is able to answer questions about the data that was used to train it.<br/>
<br/>
Ajax is said to be more capable than the prior-generation ChatGPT 3.5, and it has been trained on more than 200 billion parameters. As of September 2023, OpenAI's newer models are allegedly more powerful than Ajax.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reportedly does not have a "clear strategy" for how it will create a generative AI product for consumers. Apple is experimenting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> enhancements, software that generates videos and images, and multimodal AI technology that works with images, videos, and text.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be spending <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">millions of dollars a day</a> on conversational AI research as training language models requires a lot of hardware.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ai_for_siri">AI for Siri</h2><br/>
Apple's work on generative AI could eventually be incorporated into its &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; voice assistant. Apple in February 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/15/apple-engineers-working-on-chatgpt-like-ai/">held an AI summit</a> and briefed employees on its large language model work.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the way &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is built, it may take Apple quite a bit of time to update its database to support new capabilities. Former &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; engineer John Burkey told <em>The New York Times</em> that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s "cumbersome design" means that adding new phrases requires rebuilding the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; database, which can take up to six weeks each time, while more complicated features like search tools can take upwards of a year.<br/>
<br/>
There are also privacy concerns that Apple needs to contend with to bring generative AI capabilities to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. Apple has always been more cautious than its competitors, putting privacy ahead of functionality, a decision that has caused &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to lag behind Alexa, Google Assistant, and other voice-based personal assistant options.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em> suggests that Apple is aiming to create a feature that would let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; automate multi-step tasks, automatically performing tasks that are accomplished with Shortcuts today.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="third-party_ai_bans_at_apple">Third-Party AI Bans at Apple</h2><br/>
Apple employees <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/apple-bans-employees-from-using-chatgpt/">have been banned</a> from using ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and other artificial intelligence tools. Apple is concerned that AI tools could leak confidential company data.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. government, healthcare institutions, and banks have also prevented employees from using ChatGPT because of similar fears. Tech companies like Verizon, Google, Samsung, and others have banned generative AI tools too.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ai_competition">AI Competition</h2><br/>
Almost every major tech company has some kind of AI product in the works. In addition to OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all adopted generative AI for various purposes.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong><a href="https://bard.google.com">Google</a></strong> - Google has developed Bard, a chat-based AI tool. Google has also integrated generative AI into its search products and apps, plus Bard can integrate with Google Flights, Maps, Drive, and more.</li><br/>
 <li><strong><a href="https://www.bing.com/?/ai">Microsoft</a></strong> - Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI for a version of ChatGPT that is integrated with its Bing search engine.</li><br/>
 <li><strong><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-alexa-generative-ai">Amazon</a></strong> - Amazon is working to enhance its Alexa voice assistant with generative AI.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Meta</strong> - Meta is incorporating generative AI into several of its apps. WhatsApp and Messenger, for example, can use generative AI to make custom stickers, while there's a Meta AI beta available for WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="apples_current_use_of_ai_and_machine_learning">Apple's Current Use of AI and Machine Learning</h2><br/>
Apple is already using artificial intelligence and machine learning for a long list of functions in its products. AI is used for almost everything, with a small sampling below.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Photos</strong> - Apple uses machine learning to enhance photos that are taken with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s camera. This includes everything from Deep Fusion for cutting down on noise in images to the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Portrait Mode tools that let you enable portrait images after a photo has been taken.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Spotlight Search</strong> - Spotlight search and search throughout the iOS operating system is powered by AI.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Visual Lookup</strong> - The feature that lets the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; detect the content in photos is a machine learning feature.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Crash Detection and Fall Detection</strong> - Fall Detection and Crash Detection both use machine learning to determine whether someone has been in a crash or had a fall based on the information collected by the various sensors in Apple devices.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>ECG</strong> - The ECG feature on the Apple Watch looks at heart rhythm data to determine whether someone is likely to be experiencing atrial fibrillation.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Autocorrect</strong> - Apple's autocorrect system and word suggestion options are powered by machine learning.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Siri Suggestions</strong> - When your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; suggests something, such as sending someone a birthday message or adding an event in your Mail app to the Calendar, it's using machine learning algorithms.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Apple's devices have dedicated Neural Engines inside specifically for powering machine learning capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="tim_cook_on_ai">Tim Cook on AI</h2><br/>
Back in May 2023, Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that the potential of artificial intelligence is "very interesting," but he said there are a "number of issues that need to be sorted" with the technology. He explained that it is "very important to be deliberate and thoughtful" when deciding how and when AI should be used.<br/>
<br/>
Cook <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/03/apple-q3-2023-earnings-call-takeaways/">has also said</a> that AI and machine learning are "core fundamental technologies integral to virtually every product" that Apple has created, and that AI work is "absolutely critical" to the company. Cook has confirmed that Apple has been experimenting with generative AI "for years."<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="potential_launch_date">Potential Launch Date</h2><br/>
Both <em>The Information</em> and analyst Jeff Pu claim that Apple will have some kind of generative AI feature available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">around late 2024</a>, which is when iOS 18 will be coming out.<br/>
<br/>
Pu said in October that Apple is building a few hundred AI servers in 2023, with more to come in 2024. Apple will reportedly offer a combination of cloud-based AI and AI with on-device processing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/no-sign-of-apple-generative-ai-coming-2024/">said in August</a> that there is "no sign" of generative AI technology coming in 2024, and he claimed that Apple's work on generative AI is "significantly behind its competitors."<br/>

Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Intel, Qualcomm, and more teamed up in 2019 to ask the FCC to allow Very Low Power (VLP) devices that transmit at a low power threshold to use 6GHz spectrum without restrictions, which the FCC has now approved. The approval is for short range, tethered connections between two devices, such as the Vision Pro headset and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or an in-car system like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<blockquote>Recognizing the need to provide even more flexibility and foster unlicensed innovation, the Commission established rules that permit devices that operate at very low power (VLP) across short distances and provide very high connection speeds, which are ideal for the types of high- data rate cutting-edge applications that will both enrich consumer experiences and bolster the nation's economy. These include, for example, advanced augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), wearable sensors and technologies, and variety of Internet of Things devices.</blockquote>The FCC says that its new rules limit devices to low power levels and subject them to other technical requirements that will allow them to operate while protecting licenses that carriers have for 6GHz spectrum. Devices can, however, access higher power levels when subject to a geofencing system that prevents interference to licensed operations.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fcc/">FCC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/fcc-apple-6ghz-spectrum/">FCC Says Apple Can Use Faster 6GHz Spectrum for Headsets, CarPlay, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fcc-says-apple-can-use-faster-6ghz-spectrum-for-headsets-carplay-and-more.2408109/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a larger <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> featuring a 12.9-inch display, in what would be the biggest &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; model to date, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Citing industry sources, <em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em> highlighted that unlike the 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will not feature a mini-LED display. The device will instead feature the same LCD technology used in the current, 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. The information was shared in <em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em>' "Before Going to Press" section, so while information about the new device is currently limited, more will follow tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; has only ever been available in a single size, so presumably a 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; would be offered in addition to a separate model with a smaller screen, just like how the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is offered in both 11- and 12.9-inch variants. A recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/">rumor from <em>9to5Mac</em></a> claimed that Apple was working on two sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models. While the piece speculated that Apple could release a larger version of the ‌&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;‌ to go along with the current 10.9-inch version, <em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em>' report is the first specific mention of a larger &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; variant.<br/>
<br/>
Together, the rumors suggest that the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; could arrive sooner rather than later in the sixth incarnation of the device. The current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; featuring the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip launched over a year and a half ago, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/ipad-air-6-new-features-and-launch-timing/">new model with the M2 chip</a> is widely expected to launch in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
The current, 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;599, while the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;799. A 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; model would presumably be priced between these two products, but it is worth bearing in mind that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/2024-ipad-pro-what-to-expect/">next-generation iPad Pro models</a> are rumored to see <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">price hikes</a> owing to their costly OLED display technology.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/">Apple Working on Larger iPad Air With 12.9-Inch Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display.2408089/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 16 and 16 Plus Again Rumored to Jump From A16 to A18 Chip</title>

		<description><![CDATA[All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers Apple and its supply chain. He <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">first shared this prediction last month</a>, and he touched on the topic again in a research note this week with Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-16-To-Skip-A17-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917794" /><br/>
In his latest note, Pu said "we expect all iPhone 16 models to feature A18," and he expects the chips to be manufactured with chipmaker TSMC's second-generation 3nm process "N3E." Pu referred to the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models, based on TSMC's first-generation 3nm process "N3B," as a "transition design."<br/>
<br/>
In response to an email from <em>MacRumors</em> last month, Pu outlined his specific expectations:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> A18 chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Plus:</strong> A18 chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro:</strong> A18 Pro chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> A18 Pro chip (N3E)</li></ul>N3E is less expensive and has improved yield compared to N3B, according to TSMC.<br/>
<br/>
The standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus use the A16 Bionic chip, so a jump to the A18 chip for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus would be a notable and unique change, as it means these two models would skip over an A17-branded chip.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the iPhone 16 lineup is still around 11 months away from launching, Pu is likely making an educated guess here with the marketing names, so it remains to be seen if Apple actually moves forward with A18 and A18 Pro branding. It is possible that Apple could brand its iPhone 16 chips as the A17 and A18 Pro, mirroring recent years.<br/>
<br/>
Pu was the first source to report that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons-low-chance/">abandoned its plans for solid-state buttons</a> on the iPhone 15 Pro models. He also accurately revealed that the iPhone 15 Pro models would be equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/iphone-15-pro-features-specs-rumors/">increased 8GB of RAM</a>, and that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-15-pro-max-more-expensive/">iPhone 15 Pro Max would have a higher starting price</a> than the iPhone 14 Pro Max.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/iphone-16-jump-from-a16-to-a18-chip-rumor/">iPhone 16 and 16 Plus Again Rumored to Jump From A16 to A18 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-and-16-plus-again-rumored-to-jump-from-a16-to-a18-chip.2408082/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Rumored to Follow ChatGPT With Generative AI Features on iPhone as Soon as iOS 18</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to start implementing generative AI technology on the iPhone and iPad in late 2024 at the earliest, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers Apple's supply chain for Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
In a research note on Wednesday, Pu said his supply chain checks suggest that Apple is likely to build a few hundred AI servers in 2023, and significantly more next year. He believes Apple will offer a combination of cloud-based AI and so-called "edge AI," which involves more on-device data processing. He added that patience will be required with Apple's rollout of generative AI, as the company considers how to use and process personal data in a way that aligns with its commitment to customer privacy.<br/>
<br/>
If met, the late 2024 timeframe would mean that Apple could begin rolling out generative AI features starting with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, but it remains to be seen how it uses the technology. <em>The Information</em> last month reported that Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">incorporate large language models into Siri</a> to let users automate complex tasks, a feature that would involve deeper integration with the Shortcuts app. The report said this feature is expected to be released in an iPhone software update next year, so it could be part of iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
In August, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple's generative AI efforts were "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/no-sign-of-apple-generative-ai-coming-2024/">significantly behind its competitors</a>," so it's unclear if the late 2024 timeframe is realistic. It is possible the technology will not be ready until 2025 and onwards.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity last year when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts. Google and Microsoft released similar chatbots earlier this year, as more companies race into the space. The chatbots are trained on large language models, allowing them to respond like a human.<br/>
<br/>
In July, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-experimenting-with-chatgpt-tool/">internally testing a "ChatGPT-like" chatbot</a> nicknamed "Apple GPT," but he said the company had yet to "devise a clear strategy" for releasing generative AI tools to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has publicly confirmed its interest in generative AI, and it has mentioned the technology in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/02/apple-seeking-generative-ai-engineers-for-ar-vr/">job listings posted on its website</a> in recent months.<br/>
<br/>
"We've been working on generative AI for years and have done a lot of research," said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2023/09/29/apples-tim-cook-talks-about-ai-apps-vision-pro-and-iphone-gaming/">interview with <em>Forbes</em></a> last month. "And we're going to approach it really thoughtfully and think about it deeply, because we're fully aware of the not-good uses that it can have, and the issues around bias and hallucination and so forth."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">Apple Rumored to Follow ChatGPT With Generative AI Features on iPhone as Soon as iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rumored-to-follow-chatgpt-with-generative-ai-features-on-iphone-as-soon-as-ios-18.2408078/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix today said  that it is increasing the cost of some of its subscription plans in the United States, the UK, and France. Prices will be going up for the Basic and Premium plans in those three countries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-3.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884793" /><br/>
In the United States, the price of the Basic plan will increase from &#36;9.99 to &#36;11.99 per month, while the price of the Premium plan will increase from &#36;19.99 to &#36;22.99 per month. The ad-supported tier price will remain the same at &#36;6.99 per month, as will the &#36;15.49/month Standard plan.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix no longer offers the Basic plan to new subscribers in the United States, but prices will presumably increase for existing subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
The Premium Netflix plan is the only plan that provides access to 4K video streaming and spatial audio. The &#36;15.49 Standard plan and the ad-supported plan are limited to 1080p.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix announced the price hikes in its earnings call for the third quarter of 2023 [<a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/FINAL-Q3-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">PDF</a>], which took place today. Netflix said that it added 8.8 million new subscribers, up from 2.4 million new subscribers in the year-ago quarter. Revenue came in at &#36;8.54 billion, up from &#36;7.9 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
Subscriber growth comes after Netflix began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/09/netflix-password-crackdown-subscriber-increase/">cracking down on password sharing</a> between households. Netflix says that cancel reaction to the password sharing limitation "continues to be low," exceeding its expectations.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/netflix-price-increase-2023/">Netflix Raising U.S. Prices Yet Again, Premium Plan Now Costs &#36;23/Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-raising-u-s-prices-yet-again-premium-plan-now-costs-23-month.2408016/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

On devices running iOS 17.1, we here at <em>MacRumors</em> have continued to experience problems, and there are also continued reports about the issue <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphones-spontaneously-rebooted-last-night.2407082/">on the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, both from those running iOS 17.0.3 and those running iOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
If your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; opens to the passcode screen in the morning, or if an alarm fails to go off at the correct time, it's likely you have been impacted by this bug. In some cases, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; merely reboots, but in other cases, it turns off for several hours. The shutdown bug appears to impact multiple &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, though many of the complaints have been from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> users.<br/>
<br/>
You can tell if your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ turned off at night by opening up the Settings app, navigating to Battery, and checking the charging status over the past 24 hours. If there's a gap, the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ was turned off for a period of time.<br/>

There is no word on when this issue might be fixed, and Apple has yet to comment.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/ios-17-1-shutdown-bug-no-fix/">PSA: iOS 17.1 Doesn&#039;t Fix Nighttime iPhone Shutdown Bug</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-ios-17-1-doesnt-fix-nighttime-iphone-shutdown-bug.2408012/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>

<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023. <br/>

The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>.
