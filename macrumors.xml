Multiple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1co6iy2/the_new_sonos_app_feedback_megathread/">complaints on social media</a> have <a href="https://en.community.sonos.com/ask-a-question-228987/how-to-rollback-to-s2-6892340">called the app</a> a "step back" with missing features like editing a song queue, managing playlists, shuffling a music library, and setting alarms and timers, along with slow performance and hard-to-access system controls. There has also been feedback from users about missing accessibility features.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152675/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-response-statement">The Verge</a></em> asked Sonos about the negative feedback, and in response, Sonos said that it's aware of the complaints, but "it takes courage" to rebuild a core product.<blockquote>Redesigning the Sonos app is an ambitious undertaking that represents just how seriously we are committed to invention and re-invention. It takes courage to rebuild a brand's core product from the ground up, and to do so knowing it may require taking a few steps back to ultimately leap into the future.<br/>
<br/>
The app's revitalization not only aims to address what customers have been asking us for in the short-term, but is also critical for supporting the exciting innovations to come from Sonos in the years ahead.<br/>
<br/>
We realize there are beloved features our listeners are eager to continue enjoying now. We are working diligently to reintroduce them in the coming months, alongside additional enhancements that will make for an even better app experience.<br/>
<br/>
This is just the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Sonos as we continue to expand the way listeners can access and enjoy all the content they love in a more personalized and seamless way. We have always and will continue to listen to customer feedback so we can create sound experiences that well exceed both our standards and the standards of our listeners.</blockquote>Sonos said that it is working to address the missing features "in the coming months," and the update will ultimately lead to "exciting innovations" in the years to come. There is no way for iOS customers who have already upgraded their apps to go back to the prior version, though users are calling for Sonos to roll back the update until the new app is more fully fleshed out.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/sonos-said-rolling-out-widely-criticized-app-redesign-took-courage/">Sonos Said Rolling Out Widely Criticized App Redesign Took &#039;Courage&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-said-rolling-out-widely-criticized-app-redesign-took-courage.2425990/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/partnering-with-our-industry-to-advance-ai-transparency-and-literacy">this week announced</a> that it has started automatically labeling AI-generated content created on third-party platforms, preventing AI images and videos from confusing and misleading viewers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" /><br/>
Content made using TikTok's AI creation tools has included an AI label for more than a year, but going forward, TikTok will also label AI images made through other platforms. TikTok's tool will read Content Credentials, a technology from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). Content Credentials are designed to attach metadata to AI content, facilitating AI labeling.<br/>
<br/>
TikTok's AI labeling started rolling out today on images and videos, and it will soon be coming to audio-only content. Content created with AI will have a label that says "AI-generated" under an account's TikTok username.<br/>
<br/>
Labeling may be gradual, as content needs to have Content Credentials included for it to be identified and labeled. As other platforms adopt credentials, AI identification will increase across all social networks.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, TikTok will add Content Credentials to TikTok content that will remain when images and videos are downloaded, so people and other social networks can use the C2PA Verify tools to identify AI content that was made on TikTok.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/tiktok-label-ai-generated-content/">TikTok Becomes First Social Network to Auto Label AI-Generated Content</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-becomes-first-social-network-to-auto-label-ai-generated-content.2425982/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's shift to develop its own AI technology to keep up with competitors was today detailed in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/apple-siri-ai-chatgpt.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-947754" /><br/>
Citing sources familiar with Apple's work, the report explains that the decision to revamp <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> was taken early last year by Apple's most senior executives. Senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi and senior vice president of Machine Learning and AI Strategy John Giannandrea are said to have spent several weeks testing OpenAI's ChatGPT to understand the ways in which the competitor made &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; look antiquated. The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; team purportedly failed to receive attention and resources compared to other groups inside Apple, and the company has struggled to recruit and retain leading AI researchers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple executives are said to be concerned that AI threatens the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s market share because it has the potential to become a more compelling operating system with an ecosystem of AI apps that undermine the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Apple apparently fears the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; becoming a "dumb brick" compared with other technology.<br/>
<br/>
This conclusion triggered a significant reorganization at Apple amid determination to catch up in the race to develop AI tools. The company moved to reallocate employees and resources toward AI, and the change of strategy was a contributing factor in the decision to cancel its electric vehicle project. Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models will supposedly feature more memory to support AI features.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/should-apple-kill-siri/">Should Apple Kill Siri and Start Over?</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple is expected to reveal a series of AI tools at its WWDC keynote on June 10, including an improved version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that is more conversational and capable, with the ability to "chat" rather than merely respond to individual queries. The company is working on making &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; better at handling tasks such as setting timers, creating calendar appointments, adding items to Reminders, and summarizing text. Apple plans to market the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; as a more private alternative to rival AI services because most requests will be processed on-device rather than remotely in data centres.

		<description><![CDATA[If your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> regularly runs out of battery later in the day, Low Power Mode is one way to make it last longer. You can also make Low Power Mode automatically turn on when your battery reaches a certain custom level. Keep reading to learn how.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/low-power-mode.jpg" alt="low power mode" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950287" /><br/>
Most &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users are familiar with the way iOS throws up a prompt to turn on Low Power Mode when the battery reaches 20%. Low Power Mode can also be turned on manually at any time by going to <strong>Settings -> Battery</strong> and toggling on the switch next to <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
If you find yourself constantly having to turn on Low Power Mode late in the day, you can save some time by setting it up to run automatically when your battery is depleted to a specific custom level. This can be done in the Shortcuts app, as the following steps show.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that Low Power Mode reduces your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s performance and cuts out some background activities. For example, mail must be fetched manually, background app refresh is disabled, and motion and brightness are reduced.<br/>
<br/>
If you're okay with those limitations, follow the steps below to automate the setting on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Shortcuts</strong> app and select the <strong>Automation</strong> tab at the bottom of the screen, then tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the top-right corner.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and select <strong>Battery Level</strong> from the options.</li><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/1set-low-power-mode.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950295" /><br/>
<li>Check <strong>Falls Below 50%</strong> and then drag the slider to adjust the percentage level for when Low Power Mode should be activated.</li><br/>
<li><li>To ensure the automation runs in the background, toggle off the switch next to <strong>Ask Before Running</strong>, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Search for "Set Low Power Mode" and select the card from the results, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Lastly, tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top-right of the screen.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> may feature a display that is up to 20% brighter for typical SDR content, according to the Weibo leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-lineup-Action-button-230912.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910375" /><br/>
In a recent post, the Weibo user claimed that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; will feature up to 1,200 nits of typical SDR brightness – a 20% increase over the current models. Peak HDR brightness will apparently remain the same at 1,600 nits.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro touted a significant increase in brightness over its predecessor, featuring up to 400 nits higher HDR brightness. However, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s typical SDR brightness has been the same at 1,000 nits since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro in 2021. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s typical SDR is used in the majority of situations, so a 20% increase in standard brightness would be a significant upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital has a mixed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">track record for Apple rumors</a>, but has provided some strikingly accurate information, such as the imminent launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">2023's Yellow iPhone 14</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/">frosted back glass</a> of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/">as a minor refresh</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/">spatial video capture</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape front-facing camera</a>, and the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/">nano-texture display option</a>.<br/>

The report claims that transcriptions of audio recordings will be available in both the Voice Memos and Notes apps on iOS 18. In addition, the Notes app will apparently be able to provide AI-generated summaries of key points in audio recordings.

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp is receiving a refreshed design on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Android, the first interface overhaul of its kind since 2021.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/whatsapp-new-design.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950251" /><br/>
The new design rolling out for the Meta-owned social media platform is meant to be fresh, approachable, and simple, <a href="https://design.facebook.com/stories/whatsapp-user-interface-update/">according to WhatsApp</a>.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp says that sending photos and videos on iOS is now easier, thanks to a new attachment layout. Instead of a full screen menu, there's an expandable tray for accessing features when sending media, documents, polls, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Icons have been updated to a rounded, outlined style, and there are new illustrations with added animations for a "more playful" aesthetic.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/whatsapp-attachment-tray.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="880" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950252" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>New WhatsApp attachment tray</em></div><br/>
There's also a new "consistent" green color palette throughout the app, as well as a new dark mode that's one shade darker, which aims to reduce eye strain in low-light environments.<br/>
<br/>
The new changes are rolling out to WhatsApp users on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android now, according to the company. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/whatsapp-for-iphone-android-new-design/">WhatsApp Gets Overhauled Interface Design and New Attachment Tray</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-gets-overhauled-interface-design-and-new-attachment-tray.2425958/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When introducing the new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, Apple showed a video of a hydraulic press crushing all manner of creative tools, including musical instruments, electronic equipment, arcade games, paint and brushes, computers, cameras, and more, with the aim of demonstrating how the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> represents all of the tools condensed into a single device.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Crush! iPad Pro Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntjkwIXWtrc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The ad was a play on the popular hydraulic press videos that are popular across social media sites, but creatives found the concept to be in poor taste. Actor Hugh Grant <a href="https://twitter.com/HackedOffHugh/status/1788183871504204257">referred to the ad</a> as the "destruction of the human experience," director Reed Morano told Apple to "read the room" and called it "actually psychotic," and Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/hating-apple-goes-mainstream-fe740007">said it</a> "symbolizes everything everyone has ever hated about digitization."<br/>
<br/>

The upset over the Crush ad led Apple to issue an apology. In a <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/apple-apologizes-ipad-pro-crushed-ad-it-missed-mark/2559321">statement to <em>Ad Age</em></a>, Apple marketing vice president Tor Myhren said that the video ultimately "missed the mark."<blockquote>Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world. Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.</blockquote>Apple left the Crush video on its YouTube channel, but the ad won't be running on television.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/apple-crush-ad-apology/">Apple Apologizes for &#039;Crush&#039; iPad Pro Ad, Won&#039;t Put It on TV</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-apologizes-for-crush-ipad-pro-ad-wont-put-it-on-tv.2425951/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPad Pro&#039;s M4 Chip Outperforms M3 by Up to 25%</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Benchmarks for the new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models have <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?page=1&amp;q=iPad16%2C6&amp;utf8=✓">popped up on Geekbench</a>, giving us an idea of how much faster Apple's second-generation 3-nanometer chips are compared to the M3, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>, and other prior-generation Apple silicon chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-M4-Silver-and-Space-Black-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949561" /><br/>
The 10-core variant of the M4 chip earned an average single-core score of 3,695 and an average multi-core score of 14,550 across 10 benchmarks. When it comes to single-core performance, the M4 is faster than the M3 Max MacBook Pro, and it's comparable to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max in multi-core performance.<br/>
<br/>
For context, here are the single-core and multi-core scores of prior chips (all max CPU/GPU variants):<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>M4</strong> - 3,695/14,550</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A17 Pro</strong> - 2,908/7,234</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M2</strong> - 2,540/9,360</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M2 Pro</strong> - 2,651/14,295</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M2 Max</strong> - 2,802/14,800</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M1</strong> - 2,272/8,208</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M3</strong> - 3,087/11,702</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M3 Pro</strong> - 3,112/15,286</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M3 Max</strong> - 3,128/20,957</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Compared to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; in the prior version of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, the M4 is 46 percent faster when it comes to single-core performance, and 55 percent faster in multi-core performance. Apple didn't use the M3 in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, but it is up to 24 percent faster than the M3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said that the M4 delivers up to 1.5x faster CPU performance than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; in the prior-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, which is accurate based on the benchmarks we've seen so far.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to bring the M4 chip family to all of its products across 2024 and 2025, with the first M4 Macs slated for later this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/m4-ipad-pro-cpu-benchmark/">iPad Pro&#039;s M4 Chip Outperforms M3 by Up to 25%</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pros-m4-chip-outperforms-m3-by-up-to-25.2425947/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

This means the 13-inch iPad Air's peak brightness is equal to the previous-generation iPad Pro models with the M2 chip for standard dynamic range (SDR) content, but the new iPad Pro models have brighter OLED displays that can reach up to 1,000 nits for SDR content, and up to 1,600 nits for high dynamic range (HDR) content.<br/>
<br/>
Peak brightness levels (SDR) for recent iPad Pro and iPad Air models:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>13-inch iPad Pro (M4):</strong> 1,000 nits</li><br/>
<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro (M4):</strong> 1,000 nits</li><br/>
<li><strong>12.9-inch iPad Pro (M2):</strong> 600 nits</li><br/>
<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro (M2):</strong> 600 nits</li><br/>
<li><strong>13-inch iPad Air:</strong> 600 nits</li><br/>
<li><strong>11-inch iPad Air (M2):</strong> 500 nits</li><br/>
<li><strong>10.9-inch iPad Air (M1):</strong> 500 nits</li></ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, Apple introduced an overhauled version of the Magic Keyboard to add new features that make using an &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; feel more like using a Mac. If you’re thinking about buying one of the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models and don’t know if you should get a keyboard, this article walks through all of the new features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-1.jpg" alt="" width="1473" height="829" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950180" /><br/>
<h2>Design</h2><br/>
Apple hasn’t changed the underlying look of the Magic Keyboard, and it continues to use the floating cantilever design introduced with the prior version.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-2.jpg" alt="" width="1225" height="689" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950181" /><br/>
A magnetic back connects to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, allowing for multiple viewing angles by adjusting the amount of tilt. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; hovers over the keyboard and palm rest, which is now made from aluminum, much like the MacBook.<br/>
<br/>
The keys are backlit and use a scissor mechanism with 1mm of travel, the same as the prior-generation model. The outer cover provides front and back protection to keep the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; safe when traveling.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Function Keys</h2><br/>
The updated Magic Keyboard has a dedicated row of function keys for increasing and lowering brightness, changing the volume, controlling media playback, locking the display, initiating a search, turning on Do Not Disturb, starting dictation, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-3.jpg" alt="" width="3174" height="1785" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950182" /><br/>
The function row is similar to the function row on the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Trackpad</h2><br/>
Apple made the trackpad from glass and increased the size, making it easier to work with. The trackpad supports haptic feedback, allowing for multi-touch gestures and improving precision-based tasks like editing spreadsheets and selecting text.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Colors</h2><br/>
The Magic Keyboard comes in black and white.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-4.jpg" alt="" width="2073" height="1166" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950183" /><br/>
<h2>Passthrough Charging</h2><br/>
While the Magic Keyboard uses the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/">Smart Connector</a> on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to connect, there is an included USB-C port that can be used for passthrough charging.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Compatibility</h2><br/>
The new Magic Keyboard is compatible with the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, and it comes in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes. It does not work with other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models, and the prior version of the Magic Keyboard does not work with the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Price</h2><br/>
The 11-inch version of the Magic Keyboard is priced at &#36;299, and the 13-inch model is &#36;349.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/">Magic Keyboard</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard/">What’s New With the iPad Pro Magic Keyboard</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what’s-new-with-the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard.2425899/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to power some of its upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> features with data centers that use servers equipped with Apple silicon chips, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-09/apple-to-power-ios-18-ai-features-with-in-house-server-mac-chips-this-year">Bloomberg</a></em>’s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iCloud-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803318" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Ultra chips will be behind some of the most advanced AI tasks that are planned for this year and beyond. Apple reportedly accelerated its server building plans in response to the popularity of ChatGPT and other AI products, and future servers could use next-generation M4 chips.<br/>
<br/>
While some tasks will be done on-device, more intensive tasks like generating images and summarizing articles will require cloud connectivity. A more powerful version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> would also need cloud-based servers. Privacy has long been a concern of Apple’s, but the team working on servers says that Apple chips will inherently protect user privacy.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously claimed that all of the coming &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; features would run on-device, but it sounds like some capabilities coming this year will in fact use cloud servers. Apple plans to use its own servers for now, but in the future, it may also rely on servers from other companies.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/apple-to-power-ai-features-with-m2-ultra-servers/">Apple to Power AI Features With M2 Ultra Servers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-power-ai-features-with-m2-ultra-servers.2425894/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular accessory maker Logitech this week announced <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-learn.html">new keyboard case options</a> that are designed for Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, offering an alternative to the more expensive Magic Keyboard options from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/logitech-keyboard-case-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950160" /><br/>
The Logitech Combo Touch is compatible with both sizes of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and the two thin and light &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. Logitech says that the Logitech Combo Touch is its lightest keyboard to date, improving portability and limiting the bulk added to a tablet setup.<br/>
<br/>
The Combo Touch comes with a detachable keyboard and flexible kickstand for multiple use modes. It can be used for typing in the standard keyboard mode, or folded in a way that allows for sketching, reading, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> use.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/logitech-keyboard-case-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950161" /><br/>
There is a multi-touch trackpad, which Logitech says offers intuitive and precise input and navigation. There are auto-backlit keys in a standard layout with sixteen brightness levels. Shortcut keys allow easy access to volume control, media playback, screenshots, and more, plus there is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/">Smart Connector</a> for connectivity so there's no need for Bluetooth.<br/>
<br/>
The Combo Touch for the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is &#36;200, while the Combo Touch for the 13-inch model is &#36;230. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; versions are priced at &#36;230 and &#36;260, respectively, for the 11-inch and 13-inch models. The keyboards can be <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-learn.html">purchased from the Logitech website</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/logitech-launches-keyboard-cases-for-new-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-models/">Logitech Launches Keyboard Cases for New iPad Air and iPad Pro Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/logitech-launches-keyboard-cases-for-new-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-models.2425889/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week debuted the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, marking the first major revision to the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; lineup since the 2018 launch of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2. There are some major changes that were introduced with the new accessory, including new gestures and capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Newsroom.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949489" /><br/>
<h2>Squeeze</h2><br/>
The squeeze gesture allows the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro to sense when pressure is applied to the sides of the device. Using squeeze brings up a palette so that you can do things like switch tools, line weights, and colors.<br/>
<br/>
Developers can customize how apps react to the squeeze gesture so it can bring up custom controls in each app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Barrel Roll</h2><br/>
There is a gyroscope in the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro that allows the rotation of the barrel to change the orientation of certain tools. It basically offers much more precise control of shaped pen and brush tools, similar to how a real pen or brush would function when you tilt it while drawing or sketching.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Haptic Feedback</h2><br/>
A built-in haptic engine offers haptic feedback when using the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro's gestures. A light haptic pulse will respond when using a squeeze or double-tap gesture, plus there is feedback when using the snap to a Smart Shape feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Find My</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> is available for the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro so it can be tracked right alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and other devices in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Charging and Pairing</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro attaches to the side of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and the magnetic connection enables automatic pairing and charging. There is a new magnetic interface that is available on the 2024 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Existing Features</h2><br/>
Current &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; features like &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover and double tap are supported. Hover lets you preview where the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; will touch down on the display before a mark is made, while double tap can be used for swapping between tools.<br/>
<br/>
Low latency, tilt sensitivity, and pressure sensitivity are all included features.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Compatibility</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro is compatible with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models and the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, so it only works with the May 2024 iPads.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Price</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro is priced at &#36;129, which is also the cost of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/apple-pencil-pro-features/">Apple Pencil Pro: All the New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-pro-all-the-new-features.2425881/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models concurrently, which is why we sometimes get rumored feature leaks so far ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different, and already we have some idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue-Face-ID-Single-Camera-Hole.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-891051" /><br/>
If you plan to skip this year's iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 10 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for its successor, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released in September 2025.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">1. Under-Display Face ID</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">expected</a> to be the first ‌iPhone‌ to feature under-panel Face ID technology. The only external indication of the under-display ‌Face ID‌ technology will likely be a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. This will probably be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple is then <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-under-display-camera/">expected</a> adopt under-display cameras in 2027's "Pro" ‌iPhone‌ models for a true "all-screen" appearance.<br/>

    2. New Display Sizes</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
This year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-taller-aspect-ratio/">rumored</a> to be getting bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For 2025, Apple is also expected to bring the larger 6.27-inch display size to its standard ‌iPhone‌ model, while the equivalent "iPhone 17 Plus" model could adopt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">completely new display dimensions</a>. <br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    3. 120Hz ProMotion (Always-on Display)</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple intends to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/">expand</a> ProMotion to its standard models in 2025, allowing them to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Plus to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">4. Apple-Designed Wi-Fi 7 Chip</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's premium 2025 models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-apple-wifi-7-chip-rumor/">expected</a> to be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip for the first time. Wi-Fi 7 support would allow the "Pro" models to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. The Wi-Fi chip would also allow Apple to further reduce its dependance on external suppliers like Broadcom, which currently supplies Apple with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for iPhones.<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">5. 48MP Telephoto Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
An upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto lens on Apple's largest premium device is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/">expected</a> to be optimized for use with Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset, which launches on February 2, 2024. (The current iPhone 15 Pro models feature 48-megapixel main, 12-megapixel ultra wide, and 12-megapixel telephoto lenses.) That would make 2025's "Pro Max" the first iPhone to have a rear camera system composed entirely of 48-megapixel lenses, making it capable of capturing even more photographic detail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">6. 24MP Selfie Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 17 Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 lineup will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">24-megapixel front-facing camera</a> with a six-element lens, according to one rumor. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and this year's iPhone 16 lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. The upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">7. Scratch Resistant Anti-Reflective Display</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 17 Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">according to one rumor</a>. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 is said to have a "super-hard anti-reflective layer" that is "more scratch-resistant." It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">8. More Memory</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's Pro models next year will come with 12GB of RAM, claims <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">Jeff Pu</a> of investment firm Haitong. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro models have 8GB of RAM, while the iPhone 16 Pro models are also expected to have 8GB of RAM. Any such increase would allow for improved multitasking on the iPhone, as well as provide additional resources for any artificial intelligence features that require large-language models to be resident in memory.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">9. Smaller Dynamic Island</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's highest-end 2025 iPhone will feature a significantly narrower Dynamic Island, thanks to the device's adoption of a smaller "metalens" for the Face ID system, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">claims</a> Haitong's Jeff Pu. Assuming that's the case, it would be the first time that Apple has changed the Dynamic Island since it debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">10. iPhone 17 "Slim" </span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 17 Plus will feature a 6.55-inch display, according to analyst Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC). Responding to a claim by Jeff Pu that the ‌iPhone‌ 17 Plus will be replaced by an "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">iPhone 17 Slim,</a>" Young <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">said</a> to expect a reduction of 2% over the previous, current, and next-generation models. Based on his logic, a smaller display would help differentiate the larger ‌iPhone‌ 17 model from the ‌iPhone‌ 17 Pro Max, while remaining larger than the ‌iPhone‌ 17 and ‌iPhone‌ 17 Pro.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/10-reasons-to-wait-iphone-17/">10 Reasons to Wait for Next Year&#039;s iPhone 17</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/10-reasons-to-wait-for-next-years-iphone-17.2425877/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
