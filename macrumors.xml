		<description><![CDATA[India's Competition Commission has recalled two investigative reports accusing Apple of antitrust violations after the company raised concerns about the disclosure of confidential commercial information (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/india-orders-unusual-recall-reports-apple-antitrust-probe-2024-08-13/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/apple-india.jpg" alt="" width="2304" height="1296" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-756076" /><br/>
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has withdrawn two key reports that alleged Apple breached local competition laws. The recall, which is highly unusual, comes after the company filed a complaint claiming that the reports contained sensitive commercial data that was improperly disclosed to its competitors, including Tinder-owner Match Group. The commission has not publicly detailed the exact nature of the confidential information in question, but it is believed to primarily concern financial data related to Apple's operations in India.<br/>
<br/>
The reports were part of a prolonged investigation into Apple's practices in the Indian market, focusing on allegations that the company abused its dominant position in the app store market to force developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system. The system, which charges commissions of up to 30%, has been a subject of scrutiny around the world, with regulators in Europe, Japan, South Korea, and the United States raising similar concerns about its impact on competition and market fairness.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's defense in the case centers on its argument that it is a minor presence in India, where only 3.5% of the country's 690 million smartphones are iPhones, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Despite this relatively small market share, the CCI's initial findings suggested that Apple had exploited its position to the detriment of app developers, users, and other payment processors.<br/>
<br/>
The recall is expected to delay the investigation by several months as the CCI undertakes the process of redacting the sensitive information and potentially reissuing revised reports. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/apple-halts-indian-antitrust-probe-with-complaint/">Apple Halts Indian Antitrust Probe With Confidentiality Complaint</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-halts-indian-antitrust-probe-with-confidentiality-complaint.2433559/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> with spatial audio is now available in Rivian electric vehicles as part of the company's Connect+ subscription.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/rivian-apple-music.jpg" alt="" width="1020" height="574" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961570" /><br/>
Rivian's latest software update brings a unique, built-in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app to the company's electric vehicles, such as the R1T truck and R1S SUV. The &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app allows users to access a library of over 100 million songs, 30,000 curated playlists, and global live-streaming radio stations as part of a fully-integrated experience in Rivian's infotainment system.<br/>
<br/>
Rivian's Connect+ subscription is required to access streaming services like &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and Spotify. The subscription is priced at &#36;14.99 per month or &#36;149.99 annually and enables other features such as Wi-Fi hotspot capabilities, satellite imagery, and enhanced voice commands via Alexa. <br/>
<br/>
Vehicles equipped with Rivian's Premium Audio system, which includes an 18-speaker, 960-watt surround sound setup, can also play Dolby Atmos &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; songs with spatial audio, enabling music to be experienced in a more three-dimensional space in the vehicle. Rivian is offering a two-month free trial of Connect+ starting today.<br/>
<br/>
Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/rivian-explains-why-no-apple-carplay/">recently explained</a> that the company has no plans to introduce support for Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> in its vehicles, remarking that "we just believe that it is such an important piece of real estate, the digital ecosystem, that it was something we want to retain" and "we have taken the view of the digital experience in the vehicle wants to feel consistent and holistically harmonious across every touchpoint."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dolby-atmos/">Dolby Atmos</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rivian/">Rivian</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/apple-music-now-available-in-rivian/">Apple Music With Spatial Audio Now Available in Rivian Vehicles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-with-spatial-audio-now-available-in-rivian-vehicles.2433554/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Next year's iPhone SE 4 will almost certainly come with 8GB of RAM, up from 4GB in the 2022 model, due to the hardware requirements of Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
Currently in Apple's smartphone lineup, only the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/does-my-iphone-support-apple-intelligence/">iPhone 15 Pro models support Apple Intelligence</a>, Apple's suite of AI features coming in iOS 18.1, because the features require a minimum of 8GB of RAM. There is only 6GB RAM in the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, so they will miss out. <br/>
<br/>
Following the release of the iPhone 16 lineup in September, Apple will release the fourth-generation iPhone SE as early as the beginning of 2025, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495"><em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman</a>, and he says "you can bet that it will have Apple Intelligence." <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/apple-iphone-15-pro-requirement-apple-intelligence/">Apple Explains iPhone 15 Pro Requirement for Apple Intelligence</a></li></ul><br/>
So unless Apple discontinues the iPhone 15 models this year when the iPhone 16 series debuts, this will leave Apple's smartphone lineup in an unusual position, with a sub-&#36;500 device in the iPhone SE 4 able to run Apple's latest AI features while the standard iPhone 15 models cannot.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature an iPhone 14-like design, Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, an Action button, an Apple-designed 5G modem, an A18 processor, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. The device's display is expected to grow in size from 4.7 inches to 6.06 inches and use OLED for the first time.<br/>

Apple suppliers are expected to begin ramping up mass production of the device in October of this year. The device could be released ahead of the Lunar New Year in January 2025. However, all three existing iPhone SE models were announced in March over the years, so a March 2025 release seems quite possible too.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/iphone-se-4-8gb-ram-apple-intelligence/">iPhone SE 4 Likely to Feature 8GB of RAM for Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-likely-to-feature-8gb-of-ram-for-apple-intelligence.2433542/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the release of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-ios-18-1-beta-2-to-developers/">iOS 18.1 beta 2</a>, Apple has apparently opened up access to Apple Intelligence for English speakers located in the European Union, something that was not possible in previous versions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
One of the reasons Apple limited region access to Apple Intelligence was that it only supports US English. Another reason Apple Intelligence was previously not available in the EU was because Apple geo-locked access within the bloc, likely due to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-europe-delay/">regulatory issues</a> related to the Digital Markets Act. On the face of it, those issues still remain, and it's still not clear whether they will be resolved by the time iOS 18.1 is released in October. But at least for now, there doesn't seem to be anything stopping users in the EU who <strong>have a US App Store ID</strong> from testing out Apple Intelligence in the beta if their device supports it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Supported Devices</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence encompasses a range of capabilities, including composing text and emails, automating actions across various apps, generating images, summarizing documents and texts, and more. However, these features require a lot of on-device computing power, so before you do anything, it's worth checking if your device is compatible. iPhone users need either an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max to run Apple Intelligence, while only iPads powered by M1 or later Apple silicon processors are compatible. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Install Beta Software</h2><br/>
If your device is supported, the first thing you need to do is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-ios-18-1-developer-beta-apple-intelligence/">install the iOS 18.1 developer beta for your device</a>. Once you've followed the instructions provided in the linked article and your device is up and running with the latest beta, follow these steps on your iPhone or iPad.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>, then tap through to <strong>General ➝ Language & Region</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Add Language..</strong> and choose <strong>English (US)</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Region</strong> and choose <strong>United States</strong>. (Note that this won't affect your App Store regions or purchases.)<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/settings-region.jpg" alt="settings" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960491" /><br/>
  <li>Return to the main <strong>Settings</strong> menu and tap <strong>Apple Intelligence & Siri</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Language</strong> and choose <strong>English (United States)</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>You will now be able to join the Apple Intelligence waitlist, which in most cases gets accepted in just a few minutes. Under the Apple Intelligence header text, tap <strong>Join Waitlist</strong>.<br/>

<li>After what should hopefully be a short wait, the message will change to <strong>Turn On Apple Intelligence</strong>. Tap it, and a welcome message should appear, indicating you have sucessfully enabled the AI features on your device. </li></ol><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[TikTok is rolling out new direct messaging features including "highly requested" group chats with support for up to 32 people, the company has <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/share-your-favorite-tiktok-moments-with-direct-messaging">announced</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" /><br/>
Group chats allow users aged 16 and over to share and comment on TikTok videos with friends and family members without having to open a separate messaging app like WhatsApp or Messenger.<br/>
<br/>
Starting a group chat can be done in a couple of ways. Users can tap a Chat button at the top of the TikTok inbox and select the names of people they want to include, or they can tap Start Group Chat when sharing a post with several people.<br/>
<br/>
TikTok says it has built safety into the design of group chats for teens, and taken steps to block communication with strangers. Like regular direct messages, group chats are not available to users aged between 13 and 15. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, users in the next 16-17 age bracket can only join a group chat if they have at least one mutual friend included. If they create a group chat, they have to review and manually approve anyone new who joins.<br/>
<br/>
Owner ByteDance notes that the new group chat feature "isn't currently available everywhere," but its <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/messaging-and-notifications/direct-message-settings#7">support page</a> does not provide further details on when that may change.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, TikTok is also bringing stickers to direct messages, allowing users to communicate with each other more visually. Users can now create and upload custom stickers to the platform for anyone to use. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/tiktok-rolls-out-group-chats-32-users/">TikTok Rolls Out Group Chats With Up to 32 Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-rolls-out-group-chats-with-up-to-32-users.2433534/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Opera One Browser Launches on iOS With Aria AI Integration, Voice Input, Image Generation, and More</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.opera.com/browsers/opera/ios">Opera</a> has released its artificial intelligence-powered Opera One browser for iOS, following several weeks in beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/opera-one-browser.jpeg" alt="" width="2732" height="1356" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961526" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> app mimics the minimalist aesthetic of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/opera-one-browser-ai-launches/">company's desktop browser</a>, and "intelligently hides unnecessary elements" to make the browsing experience free from distractions. When scrolling on a page, for example, the browser hides the bottom and the top bar for a full-screen view.<br/>
<br/>
The search bar sits at the bottom of the interface for easier access, provides quick search suggestions while typing, and includes Aria AI assistant integration. There's also a new swipe-to-search gesture  that lets users activate the search bar with a simple swipe down, similar to when users search for apps from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> via Spotlight. The placed search bar is the default option, but users can alternatively choose Standard Navigation or Fast Action Button style.<br/>
<br/>
Aria can assist with a wide range of tasks, from web searches to generating text and images, according to Opera. With Voice Input, Aria allows users to speak queries instead of typing them, making it convenient when on the move or in need of hands-free operation. Aria can also create images using Google's Imagen2 model, enabling users to generate visuals simply by providing a prompt.  <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlGwGZ_jYp8?si=6nAat6yG00YezCcx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Additionally, there's a new start page carousel that is designed to keep users informed without cluttering up the interface, integrating news, live scores, and product tips into the wallpaper background. Opera also includes a built-in ad blocker, a free VPN service, and several theme customization options.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.opera.com/browsers/opera/ios">Opera One for iOS</a> comes just over a year after its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/opera-one-browser-ai-launches/">debut on desktop</a>, and can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for free [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/opera-ai-browser-with-vpn/id1411869974">Direct Link</a>]. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/opera-browser/">Opera Browser</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/opera-one-browser-launches-ios-aria-ai-integration/">Opera One Browser Launches on iOS With Aria AI Integration, Voice Input, Image Generation, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/opera-one-browser-launches-on-ios-with-aria-ai-integration-voice-input-image-generation-and-more.2433533/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It will likely be years before Apple Intelligence has a compelling enough feature set that people will pay for, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said in this week's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">Power On newsletter</a>. Apple Intelligence is still so new that Gurman expects it will "take three years" for Apple to create a product that's worth charging for, and even that "may be the best-case scenario."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960229" /><br/>
Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/apple-intelligence-subscription-price/">suggested last month</a> that Apple's long-term plan is to develop something like Apple Intelligence+, with add-on features that users would pay a monthly fee to access. Apple already has a tiered subscription setup for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, so Apple Intelligence could work similar to that.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; provides 5GB of free storage to all users, but for a fee, &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ subscription plans include more storage and also access to features like &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay. In the future, basic Apple Intelligence access could continue to be free, with more advanced features requiring a subscription. OpenAI and other companies charge for AI queries and image generation after a set free limit due to the computing power and costs associated with AI.<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, the first Apple Intelligence features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">are only partially available</a> in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 betas. Apple has added Writing Tools, some basic <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> improvements, smart replies in Messages and Mail, and a few other features like a Memory Maker option in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, but Image Playground, Genmoji, and the bulk of the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; upgrades <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/">won't be coming until later</a> in 2024 and 2025.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to fully rolling out the first Apple Intelligence features that were announced at WWDC 2024, Apple still needs to work to expand the functionality to more countries, including China and the European Union. The features that Apple showed off in June likely won't all be available until 2025, and there's no word yet on when it might expand to more countries (including other languages), so it's not hard to see how it could take until 2027 or beyond to have a robust product.<br/>
<br/>
As another reference point, Apple introduced Emergency SOS via satellite alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> in 2022, a feature that the company plans to eventually charge a fee to use, but it will be at least 2025 before the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners have to pay for it. Apple's fee for Emergency SOS has not yet been announced.<br/>
<br/>
When Apple does start charging for Apple Intelligence, it could be baked into existing &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ plans or included as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a>, Apple's subscription bundle. Counterpoint Research analyst Neil Shah recently speculated that Apple could charge between &#36;10 and &#36;20 for Apple Intelligence, with the fee rolled into an &zwnj;Apple One&zwnj; plan. The basic &zwnj;Apple One&zwnj; plan is priced at &#36;19.95 per month right now, and it includes 50GB &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ storage, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-intelligence-fees-2027/">Apple Likely Won&#039;t Charge for Apple Intelligence Features Until At Least 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-wont-charge-for-apple-intelligence-features-until-at-least-2027.2433504/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is beta testing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and the first update to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; concurrently, and we got the second betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 today alongside the sixth betas of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" /><br/>
Many of the changes in iOS 18.1 are focused on bringing the .1 betas in line with the standard betas, which recently received updates to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> and Safari, while updates in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; are to finalize features and prepare it for launch.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Photos Redesign (iOS 18.1)</h2><br/>
The redesigned &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; has proven to be not so popular with some users, so Apple streamlined it ahead of launch. The all-in-one design remains, but Apple removed the carousel to make the app less confusing and less repetitive. Apple introduced these design changes in the standard &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; update last week, and has now brought them to iOS 18.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-photos-app-redesign.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960811" /><br/>
With prior versions of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, you could swipe left to right to get to various Collections, but now Collections are accessed solely by scrolling down from the main library view. Collections include your custom albums and content that was previously in the For You section, such as featured images, videos, favorites, memories, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The Photo Library now displays more images at once in the photos grid, and Apple moved albums higher by default to make it easier for users to get to them. Recently Saved content has been integrated into Recent Days, so it's simpler to find too.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Distraction Control in Safari (iOS 18.1)</h2><br/>
Distraction Control is a new Safari option that lets you hide distracting elements from webpages and articles. You can use the feature to get rid of sign-in windows, cookie preference popups, newsletter signup videos, GDPR banners, and autoplay videos, among other things.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-distraction-control.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960812" /><br/>
What you can't use Distraction Control for is hiding ads. Apple has been clear that Distraction Control is not an ad removing tool, and while you can temporarily hide an ad, it pops right back when the ad or webpage refreshes. Distraction Control is designed for <em>static</em> content, not dynamic content, so anything that refreshes can't be hidden from view.<br/>
<br/>
You can get to Distraction Control by opening up Safari, selecting the page settings, and tapping on Hide Distracting Items. From there, you can tap on an element on the page that you want to hide from view. If you're not seeing the Hide Distracting Items option, tap on the three dots in the settings and then choose Edit and you'll be able to add it to your quick access options.<br/>
<br/>
What you've hidden will remain blocked from view as long as it's not dynamic content, but you can restore a webpage to default by going into the same options and tapping on Show Hidden Items.<br/>
<br/>
Note that if you hide a cookie banner or GDPR popup, it is the same as closing the banner without submitting your website preferences. Distraction Control settings are on-device and will not sync from one device to another, so you will need to set it up on each of your devices.<br/>
<br/>
Distraction Control was added to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; last week, and now the feature is also in the .1 betas.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Photo App Collection (iOS 18 Beta 6)</h2><br/>
Apple has further tweaked the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 6, introducing a redesigned look for the Albums Collection. Each album has a separate card, with a main thumbnail on the left. Prior versions had the album name on the left and a collection of small thumbnails.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-beta-6-photos-app-updates.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961512" /><br/>
<h2>Control Center (All Betas)</h2><br/>
In Control Center, there is a new toggle for turning Bluetooth on and off. It is separate from the general communication controls that are all lumped together, and it can be added to any Control Center page.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-beta-6-control-center.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961513" /><br/>
You can also add the Bluetooth toggle to the Lock Screen in place of the Camera or the Flashlight or assign it to the Action Button on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
There have been some tweaks to the way Control Center icons are organized in the gallery. A "Capture" section, for example, has Camera, Scan QR Code, and Magnifier options, and Silent Mode has been added under Sounds.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Dark Mode Notification Icons (All Betas)</h2><br/>
When you have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a> icons turned on, notifications that you receive from apps with a &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; icon will show with that icon properly rather than showing with the Light Mode icon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-dark-mode-notifications.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961514" /><br/>
Note that in iOS 18.1 beta 2, both &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; and &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; icons need to be turned on for notifications to have the darker icon. In &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 6, dark mode icons will show up with the darker icons turned on. &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; is not required. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Splash Screens (All Betas)</h2><br/>
As Apple prepares for the launch of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, there are new splash screens for &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, Translate, Podcasts, Home, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, Calculator, and Notes. The addition of splash screens suggests that we are nearing the end of planned changes for the base version of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, which will be installed on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-splash-screens.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961515" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Localization (iOS 18.1)</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence includes new localized versions of English in the second 18.1 beta. Options include Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and Singapore, which are in addition to the previous U.S., UK, and Australia localization options.<br/>
<br/>
No support for non-English languages has been added at this time, and Apple says that support for other languages will come later this year and in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence in EU (iOS 18.1)</h2><br/>
Multiple people located in the European Union have been able to turn on and use Apple Intelligence by setting their region to the United States and language to U.S. English.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Icon Tints (All Betas)</h2><br/>
Tints that you apply to your icons to match wallpapers are now linked to that wallpaper rather than the system. When you change your wallpaper, your icons will change as well if you've tailored them to be tinted to a wallpaper color.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-tinted-icons-wallpapers.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961516" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Music (All Betas)</h2><br/>

<h2>Lock Screen (iOS 18.1)</h2><br/>
There is no longer an option to get to Spotlight search by swiping down from the Lock Screen in iOS 18.1 beta 2, but based on it being listed a known issue in the release notes, this is a bug.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mail - Upgrade Warning</h2><br/>
Apple says that developers who have &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 5 and who are thinking of upgrading to the iOS 18.1 beta might have all their mail redownloaded.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15 and 15.1 betas that Apple provided to developers today officially introduce new &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; wallpapers that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/macos-sequoia-forest-wallpaper-hidden/">first popped up</a> last week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macos-sequoia-wallpaper-night.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961503" /><br/>
The wallpapers feature the sequoia trees that &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; is named for. The imagery likely comes from Sequoia National Park, located in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains of California. There are three separate versions of the wallpaper for different times of day: Sequoia Sunrise, Sequoia Morning, and Sequoia Night.<br/>
<br/>
Each wallpaper is animated and will shift slightly at the Lock Screen when you unlock your Mac, plus there is an option to set it as a screen saver.<br/>
<br/>
You will need the latest &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; betas to see the official wallpapers, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/macos-sequoia-forest-wallpaper-hidden/">downloadable versions</a> are available on other machines. The Sequoia wallpapers will be available to all &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; users when the operating system is released this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/macos-sequoia-beta-new-wallpapers/">Latest macOS Sequoia Betas Add New Wallpapers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-macos-sequoia-betas-add-new-wallpapers.2433483/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a third beta firmware for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, including both the Lightning and USB-C versions. The updated firmware has a build number of 7A5266c, up from 7A5244b, and it is available to developers at the current time. This is the third firmware update that Apple has released since announcing new &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 features in June.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803705" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/AirPods-Pro-Beta-Firmware.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" /><br/>
There are multiple features that are coming to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and these features are included in the firmware update.<br/>
<br/>
With head gestures, users can control <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; with a shake or a nod of the head. If you get a phone call, for example, you can shake your head no if you don't want to answer it, or nod to accept the call. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interactions can be used for responding to incoming messages, calls, and notifications.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is adding Voice Isolation to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; to cut down on loud background sounds to make you easier to hear, and there is a new Personalized Spatial Audio feature specific to gaming. Game developers will be able to incorporate spatial audio into their games for a more immersive audio experience.<br/>
<br/>
The new firmware requires a device running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; to install, and it won't be available to the public until this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/airpods-pro-beta-firmware-3-ios-18/">Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 Beta Firmware With Support for iOS 18 Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware-with-support-for-ios-18-features.2433479/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today provided developers with the second betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 to continue testing Apple Intelligence features. The second betas come two weeks after Apple seeded the first iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 betas.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960229" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
A device capable of supporting Apple Intelligence is required to download the updates, which includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and Pro Max, Apple silicon iPads, and Apple silicon Macs. The updates can be downloaded from the Settings app on a compatible device, with developers able to choose between the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>/<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>/&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15 betas or the .1 betas with Apple Intelligence functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence includes Writing Tools that are available wherever text can be selected and edited, and it can be used for spell checking, fixing grammar, rewriting with a new tone, and summarizing text.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> has a new design with a subtle glow around the display, and there is a Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; feature so you don't have to speak to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can follow along if you stumble over your words, and can maintain context between requests. Safari can summarize articles, and there's a new Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode.<br/>
<br/>
Smart replies are available in Messages and Mail, plus the Mail app surfaces time sensitive messages and puts them at the top of your inbox. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> has a Memory Movie feature for creating slideshows based on text descriptions, and you can record, transcribe, and summarize phone calls. Transcription and summarization are also available for any audio recording.<br/>
<br/>
More on all of the features that are available in the betas right now can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">found in our Apple Intelligence guide</a>. Image Playground, Genmoji, and other new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/">have not yet been implemented</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has split Apple Intelligence into a separate set of betas because these features will not be available in the initial launch versions of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;. Apple Intelligence will be available to the public later in the fall after a developer testing period.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-ios-18-1-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Developer Betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 With Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-developer-betas-of-ios-18-1-ipados-18-1-and-macos-sequoia-15-1-with-apple-intelligence.2433468/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the sixth betas of upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-5-to-developers/">release of the fifth betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;‌ Developer Beta setting. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta. The &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; beta track is now separate from the iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 beta track, with the .1 betas adding support for Apple Intelligence on devices that are able to run the features. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, a set of AI features that are built deeply into the operating system. Apple Intelligence won't be coming until later in the beta testing process, but it includes features for refining and editing writing, generating images and emoji, and most notably, improving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and search. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is gaining a better understanding of natural language, improved contextual awareness, and the personal assistant will integrate with ChatGPT to answer more complex queries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads with an M-series chip, but there are a number of other features that are coming. Apple is allowing users to rearrange Home screen apps to have open spaces, plus there's a dark mode for app icons and tinting options.<br/>
<br/>
The Control Center is customizable and third-party developers can add controls for their apps, with the Lock Screen Flashlight and Camera icons able to be replaced or removed. Messages is gaining Rich Communication Services support to improve conversations with Android users, the option to schedule texts to be sent later, new text effects, messages over satellite when there's no cellular, and the option to use any emoji for Tapback responses.<br/>
<br/>
There's a dedicated Passwords app for logins, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes, and there's now an option to lock and hide apps, which means they can't be opened without secondary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication even when your phone is unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
Safari has a highlights feature that summarizes articles and surfaces key information on websites, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app interface has been overhauled, and there's a new Tap to Cash feature for privately and securely transferring money using Apple Cash. Other features include equation solving and voice memo transcription in Notes, a game mode for improving game performance, and an option to respond to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on AirPods with head gestures.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will release &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; to the public this fall. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-6-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Sixth Betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to Developers [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-betas-of-ios-18-and-ipados-18-to-developers-update-public-beta-available.2433467/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the sixth beta of upcoming an upcoming macOS 15 Sequoia update to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-5-to-developers/">release of the fifth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macOS-Sequoia-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955370" /><br/>
Registered developers can opt-in to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, which allows you to control your locked &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from your Mac. You can open and use &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps, interact with notifications, and drag and drop files between your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Mac and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
There are new options for window tiling, and dragging a window to the edge of the display will suggest a tiled location to make it easier to use multiple apps at once. Apple is adding a Passwords app for managing passwords, Safari can summarize websites, surface key information, and Notes has support for live audio transcription and math equations.<br/>
<br/>
All of the Apple Intelligence features coming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will also be available in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, but Apple does not plan to add these until later in the beta testing process. Apple Intelligence includes Writing Tools for editing, proofreading, and summarizing text in apps, and an Image Playground allows for AI images to be created from prompts.<br/>
<br/>
Custom emoji or "Genmoji" can be created for any situation and used just like emoji, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is getting much smarter. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do more in apps and will better understand requests, especially those made in regard to on-screen content.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-6/">Apple Seeds Sixth Beta of macOS Sequoia to Developers [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-beta-of-macos-sequoia-to-developers-update-public-beta-available.2433471/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchOS-11-Thumb-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955941" /><br/>
To install the ‌&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; introduces a new Vitals app that aggregates health metrics collected during sleep like heart rate and respiratory rate, providing day-to-day health insights to track whether something has changed. There's also a Training Load feature for monitoring the intensity of workouts and how that impacts the body over time.<br/>
<br/>
The Smart Stack has been updated with new widgets and support for Live Activities and Translate, plus it is better able to suggest widgets based on time and daily routine. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> watch face includes suggestions for the best images to use, and the Check In safety feature now works with Workouts.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the sixth beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> update to developers, with the beta coming a week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-5-to-developers/">after the fifth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; is able to take the depth information from 2D photos and turn them into 3D photos using advanced machine learning. Apple says that the feature is meant to add depth to photos to make memories more immersive.<br/>
<br/>
There are new hand gestures for activating the Home View and Control Center, and the Home View is also now customizable with apps able to be rearranged. Travel Mode now includes support for trains, and Guest User profiles are now saved for 30 days so guests don't have to do the setup process every time they try out the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the year, Mac Virtual Display will support higher resolution and larger sized virtual displays, which Apple says will be equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. With an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> update, the Vision Pro can serve as an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; receiver, so content from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac can be shared to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Mindfulness app can track and respond to breathing patterns using the camera for an improved meditation experience, and the Vision Pro supports Bluetooth mice with &zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-6-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Sixth visionOS 2 Beta to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-visionos-2-beta-to-developers.2433475/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the sixth beta of the upcoming tvOS 18 refresh to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-5-to-developers/">the fifth beta came out</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-tv-4k-new-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953895" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 18 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 18 adds an InSight feature to the TV app, and it is able to provide real-time information about actors, music, and more in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> shows and music. Enhanced Dialogue has been refined with machine learning and computational audio so it is better able to boost vocal clarity over background noise and music, plus it is now available on built-in TV speakers, AirPods, and other Bluetooth devices.<br/>
<br/>
Subtitles will now show up automatically when relevant, such as when the TV's volume is muted, a show or movie is rewound, or when the language of a show doesn't match the device language.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include 21:9 aspect ratio support for projectors, new screen savers and improved controls for swapping screen savers, and support for Live Captions during <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls through an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-6-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Sixth Beta of tvOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-beta-of-tvos-18-to-developers.2433473/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Patreon today <a href="https://news.patreon.com/articles/understanding-apple-requirements-for-patreon">confirmed upcoming changes</a> to its iOS app, which will see fees for new subscriptions go up because Apple is enforcing its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules on digital purchases. Apple is requiring Patreon to adopt the in-app purchase system, a process that Patreon started at the beginning of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/patreon-app-store-fees.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961490" /><br/>
In January 2024, Patreon started using in-app purchases and paying Apple a 30 percent fee on digital products, but beginning in November, new Patreon memberships will also need to be done through in-app purchase and will be subject to the fee as well. Right now, when you subscribe to a creator through Patreon, Patreon directs you to a purchase flow that skirts built-in &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; payments, and Apple does not take a 30 percent cut.<br/>
<br/>
To account for the 30 percent fee that Apple will collect, Patreon will give creators the option to either increase their prices just in the iOS app, or absorb the fee themselves, keeping prices the same across platforms. The changes to Patreon payments will only affect new memberships purchased through an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> from November onwards, and not existing subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
Patreon says that the increased subscription fee will be the default option, and that it does not recommend that creators opt to absorb the fee themselves.<br/>
<blockquote>That said, you deserve the chance to decide whether that's something you want. So, while the automatic price increase is the default option, you also have the choice to keep your prices the same and pay the 30% fee from your earnings. We don't recommend this, because it means you'd earn less per membership on in-app iOS transactions - but ultimately we believe it's important to give you agency to make your own decisions.</blockquote><br/>
Apple will collect a 30 percent &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fee for all new memberships purchased via Patreon for iOS and for other digital goods purchased from a Patreon shop, and creators that use first-of-the-month billing or per-creation billing plans will need to swap to subscription billing for their iOS supporters because the in-app purchase system does not support the other flexible payment types.<br/>
<br/>
Per-creation billing allows Patreon members to pay their membership amount for each paid post a creator makes, with a monthly maximum. First-of-the-month billing comes into play with subscription models where a creator allows an upfront fee to unlock a backlog of content, with future payments made on the first of the month.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the limitations of in-app purchase subscriptions, Patreon is transitioning all of its creators to subscription billing, a process that it plans to complete by November 2025. Creators that already use the subscription model do not need to make changes, but creators using other methods will need to update.<br/>
<br/>
Patreon says that if it does not adopt the in-app purchase system for all iOS transactions, it risks being kicked out of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. As fees are not changing on other platforms such as the web and the Android app, Patreon suggests that creators send their fans to the <a href="https://support.patreon.com/hc/articles/27992185537037-How-iOS-in-app-purchases-works-for-fans">Patreon Help Center article</a> to explain the iOS fees compared to the fees on other platforms, so customers can "better understand the implications of where they choose to make their purchases."<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that Apple's 30 percent cut of Patreon subscriptions will be higher than the amount that Patreon keeps from creators. Patreon keeps between 8% and 12% of paid membership subscriptions, along with payment processing fees. Patreon also collects five percent from digital product sales.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will cut its fees from 30 percent to 15 percent after a subscription has lasted for one year, which is standard operating procedure for the in-app purchases. Apple has been cracking down on the sale of digital goods post-pandemic, and Facebook has also been required to pay Apple's in-app purchase fees <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/apple-responds-to-meta-boosted-posts-fee/">for ad purchases</a> on iOS devices.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/patreon-in-app-purchase-fees/">Apple Requiring Patreon to Use In-App Purchase and Pay 30% Fee for Memberships</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-requiring-patreon-to-use-in-app-purchase-and-pay-30-fee-for-memberships.2433463/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> is seemingly preparing for a significant expansion of its "Look Around" feature to compete more aggressively with Google's Street View.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/apple-maps-and-look-around.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-744451" /><br/>
Apple's "Look Around" feature offers high-resolution, interactive street-level imagery in the Maps app. To date, its scope has been relatively limited, mainly concentrated in major metropolitan areas and a few select regions worldwide. <br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://x.com/RhinozzCode/status/1822300959520784672">recent discovery</a> by X user Ryan Fae, shared with <em>MacRumors</em>, reveals that &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj;' vector tile format, used in the beta version of the web-based platform, leaks information about future Look Around coverage areas. This information, found within the Maps app's underlying code, outlines a more extensive network of planned coverage that's far beyond what is currently available. <br/>
<br/>
The leaked data shows that in the United States, Look Around coverage will no longer be confined to major cities. Instead, it will expand to include major highways, smaller cities, and rural areas. The findings also suggest that new countries are set to gain Look Around coverage as well, including Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, China, Belarus, Turkey, Bulgaria, Mexico, and Slovakia. The expansion into some of these places aligns with sightings of Apple mapping vehicles in 2023. For many of these regions, this would represent the first time high-quality street-level imagery has been made available, as Google's Street View either lacks coverage or is of low quality in these areas. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-planning-to-expand-look-around/">Apple Planning to Expand Maps App&#039;s &#039;Look Around&#039; Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-planning-to-expand-maps-apps-look-around-feature.2433460/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> "Slim" could be positioned as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> "Air" to boost sales, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature-Single-Camera-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-960528" /><br/>
In the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman explained how the "fourth" model in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup since 2020 (the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> mini, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Plus, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Plus) has largely been a commercial failure. In the case of the Plus model, this is likely because it is just &#36;100 less than the Pro, so most customers simply opt for the higher-end model.<br/>
<br/>
There has been uncertainty in recent months about the intention of the so-called &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Slim" and its rumored position in the lineup. Last week, YouTuber <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a> was <a href="https://youtu.be/8c7HWZRO_D8?feature=shared">first to suggest</a> that the device could be positioned as an "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air." Now, Gurman seems to have supported this idea.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Air" will represent a new approach to this fourth model in the lineup, offering a device with a substantially thinner design that sits between the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro. Gurman compared the device to the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> from 2008, which sat between the regular MacBook and MacBook Pro in the lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The sales pitch will probably go like this: If you want something snazzier than a standard iPhone — but don't really need the performance, screen size or cameras of a Pro model — you can get something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
At minimum, Gurman expects the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; "Air" to be more popular than the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; mini and Plus devices from recent years.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman added that the thinner design of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Air" will "just be a step toward something better" since Apple will eventually want to "squeeze the power of a Pro model into this smaller design." However, he does not expect this to occur before 2027 at the earliest.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/slim-iphone-17-could-be-iphone-air/">Next Year&#039;s Slim iPhone 17 Could Be an &#039;iPhone Air&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-years-slim-iphone-17-could-be-an-iphone-air.2433457/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
