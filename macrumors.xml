		<description><![CDATA[The avalanche of news coming out of WWDC earlier this month is finally starting to slow, but that doesn't mean there wasn't still lots to talk about in Apple news and rumors this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/top-stories-22jun2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956530" /><br/>
This week saw some additional rumors about the upcoming Apple Watch models, the release of major Final Cut Pro updates, the launch of Apple's annual Back to School promo in the U.S. and Canada, new budget-friendly Beats earbuds, and more, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Series 10 Rumored to Feature Larger Screen and Thinner Design</h2><br/>
2024 could be a big year for the Apple Watch, with rumors suggesting that Apple plans to unveil a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">special tenth-anniversary model with a major redesign</a>, just like it did with the iPhone X.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-X-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906752" /><br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo this week said the tentatively-named "Apple Watch Series 10" (which could end up being named the Apple Watch X or something else) will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">feature larger 45mm and 49mm screen size options, along with a thinner design</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo also believes the Apple Watch Ultra 3 could be available in a black or dark finish if production is successful. The devices should be unveiled in September alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 series</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Final Cut Pro Gets Major Update, New Camera App for iPhone</h2><br/>
Major new versions of Apple's professional video creation app Final Cut Pro were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/final-cut-pro-major-update/">released this week for compatible Mac and iPad models</a>. Read our coverage to learn about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/final-cut-pro-major-update/">all of the new features included</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/final-cut-pro-ipad.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949711" /><br/>
Notably, Apple has released an all-new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/final-cut-pro-major-update/">Final Cut Camera companion app for the iPhone</a>. The app powers the new Live Multicam feature in Final Cut Pro for iPad, and it also works as a standalone video recording app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's Back to School Sale Launches in U.S. and Canada</h2><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-back-to-schoo-promotion-launches/">annual Back to School promotion has returned in the U.S. and Canada</a>, offering students and select educational staff a free Apple gift card with the purchase of an eligible new Mac or iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/back-to-school-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956521" /><br/>
We have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-back-to-schoo-promotion-launches/">outlined the exact gift card values</a> in our coverage of the sale, which runs through September 30. As usual, the Back to School promotion is on top of Apple's regular educational discounts for students.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>These iOS 18 Features Aren't Coming to iPhones Until iOS 18.1 or Later</h2><br/>
iOS 18 includes many new features for the iPhone, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/ios-18-features-coming-in-ios-18-1-or-later/">not all of them will be available when the update is initially released</a> to the public in September.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
In an article this week, we listed all of the new features and changes that will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/ios-18-features-coming-in-ios-18-1-or-later/">not be available until a later version of iOS 18</a>, according to Apple's website. These features should begin rolling out with iOS 18.1 in October, followed by iOS 18.2 in December, with more to come next year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Beats Solo Buds Now Available: 18-Hour Battery and a Tiny Case for &#36;79.99</h2><br/>
The new Beats Solo Buds wireless earbuds are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/beats-solo-buds-orders/">now available to order on Apple's online store</a> for delivery, and they can also be purchased in person <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/beats-solo-buds-available-at-apple-stores-today/">at select Apple retail stores</a> and resellers around the world.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Beats-Solo-Buds-Hands-on-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956024" /><br/>
Beats Solo Buds feature an affordable &#36;79.99 price, up to 18 hours of battery life, and a compact USB-C carrying case. However, they lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Seeds First Beta of iOS 17.6</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-seeds-ios-17-6-beta-1-to-developers/">first betas of iOS 17.6</a>, macOS 14.6, tvOS 17.6, visionOS 1.3, and other software updates are now available for testing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-17.6-Feature-Redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950716" /><br/>
There is not a whole lot new in the iOS 17.6 beta so far for the iPhone, with only minor changes discovered within the update's code. Apple has already shifted its focus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">towards iOS 18</a>, which is currently in beta for developers and will be released to the public later this year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-06-21/more-choice-for-us-subscribers/">today announced</a> the launch of a new Basic paid plan that offers a small discount for dropping access to audiobooks. Priced at &#36;10.99 per month, the Basic option includes all of the music benefits of Spotify like ad-free playback, but without added monthly audiobook listening time.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810756" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" /><br/>
The &#36;11.99 standard Premium Individual plan that Spotify offers includes ad-free playback and 15 hours of audiobook listening time per month from a catalog of more than 250,000 titles. Until now, Spotify did not let customers opt for a cheaper plan that did not include audiobook access, as it was automatically bundled in the lowest-tier plan.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify in June <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/spotify-price-increase/">raised its base price</a> from &#36;10.99 to &#36;11.99 to "bring users the best experience," but with the new Basic plan, customers who don't want to use the audiobook feature can get the prior &#36;10.99/month price.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify's new &#36;10.99 per month option is on par with the &#36;10.99 price of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, so Spotify is no longer &#36;1 more expensive than &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; for base music subscription service.<br/>
<br/>
There have been no changes to the prices of other plans. Duo is priced at &#36;16.99, and Family is priced at &#36;19.99. Spotify also has a &#36;9.99 per month plan that offers 15 hours of audiobook listening with ad-supported music.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/spotify-cheaper-premium-plan/">Spotify Launches Cheaper &#36;10.99/Month Premium Plan Without Audiobooks</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-launches-cheaper-10-99-month-premium-plan-without-audiobooks.2429791/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is working with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, where ChatGPT will work alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> to handle requests for AI-generated content. ChatGPT and other similar AI services are not available in China, so Apple needs to find an alternative.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954498" /><br/>
Apple is actively looking for a Chinese company to partner with for its AI features in China, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/for-apples-ai-push-china-is-a-missing-piece-7d2b0ec6">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>. Apple has held talks with Baidu, Alibaba Group, and Beijing startup Baichuan AI, but no deal has emerged.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are going to be limited to an increasingly small number of customers when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> launch this fall. Apple today said that it would not bring these features to countries in the European Union, and without a deal with a Chinese AI company, China could be out too.<br/>
<br/>
China requires companies to get government approval before rolling out chatbots powered by large language models, and to date, has not approved any AI products that were developed outside of the country. Apple did look into the possibility of getting approval for its own large language model, but found that Chinese regulators were not likely to allow it. To bring Apple Intelligence features to China, Apple has to sign a deal with a Chinese AI company.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if Apple would have time to prepare a Chinese version of Apple Intelligence for September even if it did manage to secure a deal in the near future, so Apple Intelligence is not likely to come to China until a later date. Even if Apple did make it happen, Apple Intelligence will only be available in U.S. English at launch, with support for additional languages coming in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Apple is falling behind competing smartphone companies in China because AI features are already available on devices from top-selling Chinese brands like Vivo, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Honor. Even Samsung has a smartphone with AI integrations in China, as it has partnered with Baidu and Meitu.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-ai-partner-china/">Apple Seeks AI Partner for Apple Intelligence in China</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeks-ai-partner-for-apple-intelligence-in-china.2429788/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple competitor Amazon is working on a revamp of its Alexa assistant, and the new version could cost up &#36;10 per month, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-mulls-5-10-monthly-price-tag-unprofitable-alexa-service-ai-revamp-2024-06-21/">Reuters</a></em>. The upcoming version of Alexa will support conversational generative AI, and Amazon is planning for two tiers of service.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/amazon-echo-dot.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956668" /><br/>
There will be a free tier and a second, premium tier that is priced at &#36;5 at a minimum, with Amazon considering price points ranging from &#36;5 to &#36;10. Amazon does not plan to include the premium Alexa tier with its &#36;139 per year Prime subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Amazon has not made significant updates to Alexa in the last decade, and it has fallen behind other AI products that have started to adopt large language models. Alexa is free and built into Amazon devices, so Amazon does not make money directly from it as of now. Some employees that spoke to <em>Reuters</em> said the revamp is a "desperate attempt" to revitalize Alexa, and Amazon executives have suggested it is imperative Alexa demonstrate it can generate "meaningful" sales.<br/>
<br/>
The updated version of Alexa, which Amazon calls "Remarkable Alexa" internally, is expected to be able to do things like craft emails, give shopping advice, and order delivery from Uber Eats. Amazon also wants to improve the way that Alexa controls smart home products, with Alexa able to learn how to automate routines.<br/>

Amazon is aiming to have the updated version of Alexa finished by August, which would see it launch later this year. Apple is working on a similarly updated version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that also incorporates large language models, though many of the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functions <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-siri-improvements-coming-2025/">won't be coming until 2025</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alexa/">Alexa</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/amazon-paid-alexa-plan/">Amazon Could Charge Up to &#36;10/Month for Alexa</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amazon-could-charge-up-to-10-month-for-alexa.2429786/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch has a hidden feature for activating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-shift/">Night Shift</a> on the device, a Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1dkv3pl/how_long_has_night_shift_on_apple_watch_been_a/">discovered recently</a>. If you ask <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> on the Apple Watch to turn on &zwnj;Night Shift&zwnj;, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will do so, and the display will take on the dimmer, yellow hue that lowers blue light exposure.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-watch-night-shift.jpg" alt="" width="1521" height="856" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956680" /><br/>
It is not clear how long &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has been able to activate &zwnj;Night Shift&zwnj; on the Apple Watch, but it seems to be recent. Apple has no documentation on &zwnj;Night Shift&zwnj; on Apple Watch, and it was not previously a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> option. It's possible &zwnj;Night Shift&zwnj; is tied to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>, but it is not limited to devices running &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj;. We were able to use the feature on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> with &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; installed.<br/>
<br/>
Activating &zwnj;Night Shift&zwnj; can only be done through &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, and there is no toggle in the Apple Watch Settings app or elsewhere on the device. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; mentions scheduling &zwnj;Night Shift&zwnj; in the Settings app, but that's not an option at the current time in &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; or &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Night Shift&zwnj; does not appear to be available on all Apple Watch models, with Reddit users unable to activate it on a Series 5 and lower.<br/>
<br/>
The option to suddenly turn on &zwnj;Night Shift&zwnj; without an accompanying setting suggests that it is a feature that has been accidentally introduced, and the toggle could be introduced in a future version of &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; or an upcoming &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; update.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/siri-night-shift-apple-watch/">PSA: Siri Can Turn on Night Shift on Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-siri-can-turn-on-night-shift-on-apple-watch.2429782/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to release the second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> to developers on Monday, Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz told <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183251/apple-eu-delay-ai-screen-mirroring-shareplay-dma">The Verge</a></em>. The information was provided as part of a statement on certain new &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> features that will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-europe-delay/">delayed in the European Union</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Two of the features that will not be coming to the EU this fall are set to debut in next week's &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; developer beta, with Apple introducing support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; and expanded SharePlay screen sharing across &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring allows an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to be controlled via a Mac, with full functionality for accessing apps, interacting with notifications, and more. SharePlay screen sharing will let Apple users take over the screen of another Apple user to provide technical support and other help.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of these options are available in the current &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; betas, as Apple is rolling out features during the beta testing period. Apple Intelligence, which also won't be coming in the European Union, is set to come out later this summer. Apple will likely time it to the public beta, which is coming in July.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that it needs to delay some features in the European Union because of the complexities of making sure they adhere to the regulations mandated in the Digital Markets Act.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/ios-18-beta-2-coming-monday/">Second iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia Betas Coming Monday With iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/second-ios-18-ipados-18-and-macos-sequoia-betas-coming-monday-with-iphone-mirroring-and-shareplay-screen-sharing.2429777/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today said that European customers will not get access to the Apple Intelligence, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, and SharePlay Screen Sharing features that are coming to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac this September due to regulatory issues related to the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
In a statement to <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/360751cb-7a22-48e0-9b00-6a30ff41dcfe">Financial Times</a></em>, Apple said that there will be a delay as it works to figure out how to make the new functionality compatible with the European Union's competition rules.<br/>
<blockquote>Due to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act, we do not believe that we will be able to roll out three of these [new] features -- iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence -- to our EU users this year.</blockquote><br/>
Apple Intelligence includes a wide range of additions that overhaul everything from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> to apps, while &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring is a feature that allows the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to be controlled on a connected Mac. SharePlay Screen Sharing lets users take control of another person's screen while using the SharePlay feature, with the aim of providing assistance. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the Siri-related Apple Intelligence capabilities <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-siri-improvements-coming-2025/">will not be launching</a> until 2025, but Genmoji, Image Playground, Writing Tools, and many new in-app capabilities are set to be available starting in September, and these are what &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and Mac users in the European Union will miss out on. It is not clear how long it will take Apple to expand this features to the EU, nor what changes Apple might have to make to introduce them under the DMA.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's warning comes as the European Commission <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-dma-issues-eu-rule-enforcement-soon/">prepares to make a ruling</a> on whether prior changes to allow for app marketplaces meet the terms of the DMA. Regulators have said that there are "very serious" issues with Apple's implementation, likely related to the Core Technology Fee that Apple is charging. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-europe-delay/">Apple Intelligence Features Not Coming to European Union at Launch Due to DMA</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-features-not-coming-to-european-union-at-launch-due-to-dma.2429759/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/answering-apple-intelligence-questions-vision-pro-2/id1602394741?i=1000659775557">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss Apple Intelligence, the apparent suspension of work on the second-generation Vision Pro headset, and Apple's rumored plans to move to thinner device designs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eIxKrnytZXc?si=-Ovs5t-Ylj5SSNXX" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Apple Intelligence is Apple's upcoming personalized AI experience for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac. We look at the device limitations around the feature and address speculation that older models could have utilized the cloud processing to offer Apple Intelligence. While cloud computing is an important part of Apple's AI solution, on-device processing plays a crucial role in making Apple Intelligence functional, private, and efficient. We discuss these <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/apple-iphone-15-pro-requirement-apple-intelligence/">device requirements</a>, including the necessity for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or later chips in Macs and iPads, and how these specifications should ensure a good user experience. We also explore the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence and its implications and consider the potential workflows with Apple Intelligence, contemplating what might be possible with advanced AI integration across apps.<br/>
<br/>
Next, we discuss the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2/">suspension of work</a> on the second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset. Although Apple had reportedly been focusing on developing a lower-cost headset for some time, the news of Apple's decision to halt work the second-generation Vision Pro still comes as a surprise. We examine what this means for the future of the Apple Vision product line, including the potential benefits and drawbacks of prioritizing a less expensive model. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, we turn our attention to the future of Apple's devices, particularly the company's recently reported decision to again <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/">move toward thinner and lighter products</a>. We delve into the ongoing debate between the benefits of thinner, more portable devices versus thicker ones with larger batteries. The M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models and the upcoming "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> Slim" demonstrate this trend, touting redesigns that aim to offer a more streamlined form factor without sacrificing battery life. We also discuss the anticipated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/m4-macbook-pro-late-2024/">MacBook Pro models with M4 series chips</a> that are now expected to launch later this year. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Antstream Arcade has <a href="https://www.antstream.com/apple">announced</a> that its cloud-based game streaming service will be available on the iPhone and iPad starting Thursday, June 27. The app will provide subscribers with access to <a href="https://www.antstream.com/games">over 1,300 licensed games</a> from a variety of retro consoles, including the Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, SEGA Genesis, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Antstream-Arcade-iPhone-and-Controller-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956600" /><br/>
Earlier this year, Apple updated its guidelines to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-allows-game-streaming-apps-on-app-store/">permit game streaming apps in the App Store</a> worldwide, allowing for a selection of games to be offered within a single app. These services, such as Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW, were previously only accessible via the web on the iPhone and iPad. Antstream Arcade is set to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183027/antstream-emulator-apple-iphone-retro-games-ipad-streaming">become the first</a> popular service of its kind to take advantage of the rule change.<br/>
<br/>
The primary benefit of Antstream Arcade <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/16/iphone-app-store-emulators-list/">compared to emulators</a> is that you do not need to provide your own games downloaded from the internet, but this will come at a cost. According <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/retro-videogame-streaming-service-antstream-to-launch-on-the-app-store-next-week/">to <em>MacStories</em></a>, the service will cost &#36;4.99 per month or &#36;39.99 per year, following limited-time &#36;3.99 per month or &#36;29.99 per year pricing at launch. In addition, Antstream Arcade requires a Wi-Fi or cellular connection to stream games, and the service offers only a handful of games for consoles like the NES, SNES, Game Boy, and PS1.<br/>
<br/>
Antstream Arcade is already available on platforms such as Android, Windows, and Xbox.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/antstream-arcade-launching-on-iphone-and-ipad/">&#039;Antstream Arcade&#039; App With Over 1,300 Retro Games Launching on iPhone and iPad Next Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/antstream-arcade-app-with-over-1-300-retro-games-launching-on-iphone-and-ipad-next-week.2429753/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

In apps that implement this new pairing process, users would be able to connect accessories to their devices directly in the app, without having to open the Settings app. In addition, Apple said this pairing process increases privacy by preventing accessory makers from gaining visibility into other devices on the user's local network.<br/>
<br/>
Developers can add the AirPods-like pairing process to their apps with the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessorysetupkit">AccessorySetupKit</a> framework, with more details available in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10203/">this WWDC 2024 coding video</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is currently in beta for developers, and a public beta will be released in July. The update should be widely released in September, but it will take time for accessory makers to add support for this pairing process to their apps.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/ios-18-airpods-like-pairing-for-more-accessories/">iOS 18 Expands Convenient AirPods-Like Pairing to More Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Accessories</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-expands-convenient-airpods-like-pairing-to-more-bluetooth-and-wi-fi-accessories.2429744/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>1Password Launches Recovery Codes and Simplified Sign-In Process</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular password management app 1Password <a href="https://blog.1password.com/introducing-1password-recovery-codes/">today announced the launch</a> of two new features that are designed to make the app more user friendly. 1Password is improving the sign-in process on new devices and adding the ability to recover an account when a master password and secret key are lost.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Introducing Recovery Codes" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8rZxntMlN0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
With recovery codes, 1Password is providing a failsafe that will let customers back into their accounts in the event that a password is lost. 1Password already provides an Emergency Kit PDF that includes a Secret Key, and users are instructed to keep the Secret Key safe. The Secret Key allows for access to a 1Password account if the master password isn't available, but prior to now, if the Secret Key was also lost, there was no option for account recovery.<br/>
<br/>
1Password users can now log in and generate a recovery code, which can be used to regain access to an account. The company recommends that customers go through the recovery code process immediately, as a recovery code can't be generated after a user is locked out of their 1Password account.<br/>
<br/>
After a recovery code has been created, it can be used at any time to regain access to a 1Password account, though users will need access to the email address associated with their 1Password account.<br/>
<br/>
Generating a recovery code can be done by going to the Manage Accounts section, selecting Sign-in and Recovery, and choosing the "Set up recovery code option." 1Password recommends that recovery codes be stored in a safe and accessible place.<br/>
<br/>
1Password is also testing an updated sign-in experience in a beta capacity, with the new method aimed at making it easier to log in on a new device or through a web browser. When logging in somewhere new, users can now choose the Scan QR Code option from the top left account menu in 1Password and scan a QR code on the new device to log in.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Scan a QR Code to set up 1Password on a new device" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/obqEheFUyis" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The new sign-in option is available in beta and nightly release channels on 1Password for desktop and TestFlight for iOS. Recovery codes are available to all 1Password users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/1password/">1Password</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/1password-launches-recovery-codes/">1Password Launches Recovery Codes and Simplified Sign-In Process</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/1password-launches-recovery-codes-and-simplified-sign-in-process.2429706/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> games optimized for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-arcade-launches-two-hit-games-on-apple-vision-pro/">are set to launch</a> on the headset, with Warped Kart Racers available today and Cityscapes: Sim Builder coming out on July 3.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-arcade-vision-pro-warped-kart.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956482" /><br/>
Warped Kart Racers is a racing game that features characters from 20th Television animated shows like Family Guy, King of the Hill, American Dad, and Solar Opposites. Players can take control of one of 20 playable characters and race against friends across 16 maps that come from iconic show episodes. There's both a single player campaign and the option for multiplayer matches.<br/>
<br/>
Cityscapes: Sim Builder was the &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; Game of the Year and an Apple Design Award finalist. Players are able to become the mayor of an up and coming city, developing careful, thought out systems to meet the needs of the city's citizens.<br/>
<br/>
Power, clean water, garbage collection, pollution, and road traffic all need to be dealt with, and establishing a thriving city raises the power level and unlocks more city options. The game has a City Pass, which is a monthly event that includes exclusive parks, buildings, and landmarks.<br/>
<br/>
Both Cityscapes: Sim Builder and Warped Kart Racers are available on existing Apple devices through &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;, but the update will also allow them to be played using the Vision Pro's hand gestures and eye controls. In Warped Kart Racers, players use their hands to steer, drift, and throw objects, and in Cityscapes: Sim Builder, hand movements are used to lay roads and build neighborhoods.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and third-party developers have made several &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; games available on the Vision Pro, including Game Room, What the Golf, Super Fruit Ninja, and Crossy Road Stories. Apple is releasing content updates for two Vision Pro games today, including Gibbon: Beyond the Trees and Bloons TD 6+.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; is priced at &#36;6.99 per month and provides access to up to six family members. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; games do not include in-app purchases or other freemium features.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-vision-pro-warped-kart-racers/">Warped Kart Racers and Cityscapes: Sim Builder Coming to Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/warped-kart-racers-and-cityscapes-sim-builder-coming-to-apple-vision-pro.2429702/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Satechi today announced the launch of its latest Qi2 product, a car charger that is able to mount to a vehicle's vents. The Qi2 Wireless Car Charger is able to charge a compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at up to 15W, which is the same speed as an official <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charger.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/satechi-qi2-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956497" /><br/>
Like many of Satechi's products, the Qi2 Wireless Car Charger is made from an aluminum material that is designed to match Apple's devices It comes in a space gray color, with a soft black silicone charging pad available for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. It clips on to a vent with a stabilizing clamp, and includes a 25W car charger and 3.3-foot USB-C cable. The mount is able to swivel, and it can be used in landscape or portrait mode.<br/>
<br/>
Qi2 charging speeds are available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 and later, with Apple adding support for the faster charging through software updates. All of Apple's &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; iPhones are now able to charge at the faster Qi2 speeds. As with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will need to be caseless or equipped with a magnetic case.<br/>
<br/>
The Qi2 Wireless Car Charger can be <a href="https://satechi.net/products/qi2-wireless-car-charger">purchased from the Satechi website</a> for &#36;60.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/satechi/">Satechi</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/satechi-qi2-wireless-car-charger/">Satechi Launches Qi2 Wireless Car Charger</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/satechi-launches-qi2-wireless-car-charger.2429698/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10117/">WWDC 2024 coding video</a> last week, Apple highlighted a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Translation">recently-introduced API</a> that allows developers to offer built-in Translate app capabilities in their own apps on iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS Sonoma, and later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-17-4-Translate-App-API.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956475" /><br/>
While the iPhone, iPad, and Mac already offer a system-level translation function for highlighted text, websites viewed in Safari, and more, the API provides a convenient solution for user-generated content like reviews. For example, if a user writes a review in Japanese, the text can be quickly translated to other languages.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia enhance the API by allowing translated text to appear in-line within an app, instead of in an overlaid Translate sheet.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Translate-App-API.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956474" /><br/>
Another language-related change on iOS 18 is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10185/">bilingual keyboard support</a>. For example, you can type in English and Korean on the same keyboard without having to manually switch languages, complete with word suggestions in each language.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming macOS 14.6 update to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its launch. Today's public beta comes a few days after Apple released the initial developer beta. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Apple today seeded the third beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.5 update to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its launch. The public beta comes a week after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/apple-releases-second-public-beta-of-ios-17-5/">released the second public beta</a> and a day after Apple seeded the beta to developers. <br/>
<br/>
Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
No new Mac features were found in the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.6 developer beta, so it is not clear what might be included. With Apple now working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, development on &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; is beginning to wrap up.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-releases-first-macos-sonoma-14-6-public-beta/">Apple Releases First macOS Sonoma 14.6 Public Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-first-macos-sonoma-14-6-public-beta.2429685/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
The new additions Apple promised for &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; have all been implemented at this point, so it is not clear what will be included in iOS 17.6, and no features were discovered in the developer beta.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple now shifting its focus to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, it is likely that iOS 17.6 will include bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/new-versions-of-final-cut-pro-for-ipad-and-mac-available-today/">today released</a> Final Cut Pro 2 for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Final Cut Pro 10.8 for the Mac, two Final Cut Pro updates that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/final-cut-pro-ipad-2/">first announced back in May</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Final Cut Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has been updated with new capabilities that are designed for the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models that came out earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
Live Multicam lets users capture up to four different angles of a single scene using connected iPhones and iPads. To make this feature work, Apple has created a Final Cut Camera app that captures video from each of the devices and feeds it into Final Cut Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Users can get a director's view of each connected camera in real time, and the settings can be adjusted from the Final Cut Pro app. There are options for tweaking exposure, focus, white balance, ISO, shutter speed, and zoom to get the perfect shots. Preview clips are passed through to Final Cut Pro and then replaced with full-resolution files so users can quickly move from production to editing.<br/>
<br/>
Final Cut Camera is available as a standalone app as of today and in addition to feeding footage to Final Cut Pro, it can be used as a video capture app for recording video with precise manual controls.<br/>

The updated Final Cut Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app supports external projects, so users can create or open projects on an external device and import media without taking up &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; storage space. Apple added additional customization options to Final Cut Pro, including 12 color-grading presets, eight basic text titles, 20 soundtracks, and new dynamic backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
With the M4 chip, final rendering with Final Cut Pro is up to 2x faster, and it supports up to 4x more streams of ProRes RAW than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. Final Cut for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, adding support for barrel roll and squeeze, improving access to and control over tools.<br/>
<br/>
As for Final Cut Pro for the Mac, it includes Enhance Light and Color, an AI feature that improves color, color balance, contrast, and brightness in one step. Smooth Slo-Mo, another new feature, blends frames of video intelligently to provide higher-quality movement.<br/>
<br/>
Final Cut Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 2 is available as a free update for existing users, with new users able to purchase it for &#36;4.99 per month or &#36;49 per year. Final Cut Pro for Mac 10.8 is also available as a free update for existing users, with new users able to purchase the software for &#36;299.99. Apple has also released new versions of Compressor and Motion.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/final-cut-pro/">Final Cut Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/final-cut-pro-major-update/">Final Cut Pro Gets Major Update With New Camera App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/final-cut-pro-gets-major-update-with-new-camera-app.2429683/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
