		<description><![CDATA[The new iPad Pro and iPad Air will begin arriving to customers over the next 24 hours. It appears that the initial batch of the devices will have a <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1790190359445655828">special build of iPadOS 17.4 preinstalled</a>, but an <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1790188873697362295">iPadOS 17.5 software update will be available</a> in the Settings app right away, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-and-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950313" /><br/>
iPadOS 17.5 has a special build number of 21F84 on the new iPads, and modified release notes that mention improved document scanning:<blockquote>Apple News+<br/>
• Offline mode in Apple News+ gives you access to the Today feed and News+ tab, even when you don't have an internet connection<br/>
• Quartiles is a new and original daily word game that is now available in Apple News+<br/>
• Scoreboard in News+ Puzzles gives you access to new player data for Crossword, Mini Crossword and Quartiles, including stats and streaks<br/>
<br/>
Tracking Notifications<br/>
• Cross-Platform Tracking Detection delivers notifications to users if a compatible Bluetooth tracker they do not own is moving with them, regardless of what operating system the device is paired with<br/>
<br/>
Document Scanning<br/>
• Document scanning is improved on the new iPad Air and iPad Pro</blockquote>The new iPad Pro models with the M4 chip are equipped with "adaptive True Tone flash" for improved document scanning. It is unclear if the feature requires iPadOS 17.5, or if the update simply further optimizes the functionality.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-Improved-Document-Scanning.jpg" alt="" width="5100" height="2868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950698" /><br/>
With adaptive True Tone flash and AI, the new iPad Pro can eliminate shadows on scanned documents, as Apple explained in a press release:<blockquote>It also now features a new adaptive True Tone flash that makes document scanning on the new iPad Pro better than ever. Using AI, the new iPad Pro automatically identifies documents right in the Camera app, and if a shadow is in the way, it instantly takes multiple photos with the new adaptive flash, stitching the scan together for a dramatically better scan.</blockquote>Improved document scanning will be available in the Camera, Files, and Notes apps, and third-party apps will be able to offer the feature too.<br/>
<br/>
The new iPad Air does not have adaptive True Tone flash, so it is unclear how document scanning is improved on those models, as Apple indicates.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 17.5 was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-releases-ios-17-5/">already released on Monday</a> for all other iPads, with a build number of 21F79 and no mention of improved document scanning.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/new-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-day-one-update/">New iPad Pro and iPad Air Will Have Day-One Software Update With These Release Notes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-will-have-day-one-software-update-with-these-release-notes.2426305/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-releases-ios-17-5/">iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5</a> include 15 security patches for the iPhone and iPad, according to a recently-published <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214101">Apple support document</a>, but unfortunately one of the patches has led to a software bug affecting alternative app marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-17.5-Security-Update-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950652" /><br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/mysk_co/status/1790121816872161363">According to Mysk</a>, a security patch related to the MarketplaceKit framework has resulted in a bug that prevents iPhone users in the EU from reinstalling an alternative app marketplace <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/altstore-eu-alternative-app-marketplace/">like AltStore</a> if they happen to delete the app after initially installing it. Apple will likely fix this issue in a subsequent update, such as iOS 17.5.1.<br/>
<br/>
In related news, one security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/R00tkitSMM/status/1790269915028467800">has complained</a> that the iOS kernel vulnerability they discovered was not eligible for payment under the Apple Security Bounty program. It is listed in the iOS 17.5 security fixes below under "AppleAVD."<br/>

		<title>13-Inch iPad Pro Magic Keyboard ~50 Grams Lighter Than Older Model</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new Magic Keyboard accessory for the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models is "thinner and lighter" than the model it replaces, according to the company. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-3.jpg" alt="" width="3174" height="1785" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950182" /><br/>
Apple typically does not provide weight specifications for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> accessories, but some early reviewers have effectively confirmed Apple's claims with their own figures for the 13-inch version of the Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Six Colors</em>' <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/05/m4_ipad_pro_review/">Jason Snell</a> weighed the 13-inch Magic Keyboard at 667 grams, while <a href="https://youtu.be/cOiGtyPTrvU">Brian Tong</a> put the accessory at 662 grams and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review">The Verge</a></em> recorded 658 grams on its scales.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the small variations, from these figures we can conclude that the 13-inch Magic Keyboard is around 50 grams lighter than the previous generation model, which weighed around <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/20/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-heavier-macbook/">710 grams</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that at 580 grams, the new 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; itself is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipad-air-now-heavier-than-ipad-pro/">much lighter</a> than the previous generation 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, which weighed 682 grams. <br/>
<br/>
Based on these numbers, the total weight of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and Magic Keyboard is around 1,247 grams, which is exceedingly close to the stated 1.24 kg weight of Apple's M3-powered 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the 11-inch Magic Keyboard is 580 grams, according to a <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/early-magic-keyboard-and-apple-pencil-pro.2426072/">MacRumors forum member</a> who received theirs early.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> will use an M3 processor, according to details posted on X earlier today by a private account with a proven track record of sharing accurate information about Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M2-iPad-Air-Hero-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949535" /><br/>
Apple just last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-ipad-air-models-in-new-11-13-inch/">announced</a> its latest &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models powered by the company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. The two new 11-inch and 13-inch models replaced the previous M1-powered 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, which was released in 2022. Apple also just announced new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models that were until recently expected to feature the M3 chip. <br/>
<br/>
Combined with Apple's surprise debut of the M4, today's rumor suggests that Apple plans to keep the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; one step behind the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; in terms of processor generations. Given the recent announcements, it's very early to speculate on a future generation of &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, but rumors have suggested that Apple plans to introduce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-oled-roadmap/">10.8-inch OLED iPad Air</a>, and that the tablet could come out <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/ipad-air-oled-adoption-timeline/">between 2026 and 2028</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is nearly 50% faster than the previous &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>, according to Apple. Compared to &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with A14 Bionic, it provides 3x faster performance. Like the previous model, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;599, while the 13-inch device starts at &#36;799, and both sizes are available from Wednesday, May 15.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/next-gen-ipad-air-with-m3-chip-rumored/">Next-Generation iPad Air With M3 Chip Already Rumored</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-generation-ipad-air-with-m3-chip-already-rumored.2426292/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPad Pro: How Apple Intends to Avoid Another &#039;Bendgate&#039; Controversy</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">latest iPad Pro</a> is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/">thinnest device the company has ever made</a>... but does it bend? That's likely to be the question on the mind of anyone who remembers the last iPad Pro "bendgate" controversy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m4-ipad-pro-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950292" /><br/>
In 2018, Apple responded to durability concerns shared by new iPad Pro owners by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/19/apple-2018-ipad-pros-ship-bent/">admitting</a> to shipping its then-new models with a "very slight bend in the aluminum chassis," which it blamed on a "side effect of the manufacturing process." <br/>
<br/>
Despite videos indicating that the 2018 iPad Pro models bent more easily than other models, Apple said the bend did not worsen over time or negatively affect the iPad's performance, and that concerns over the device's durability were unfounded. <br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, some iPad owners were understandably upset to find defects in devices that cost hundreds of dollars. Apple naturally wants to avoid a similar scenario with its latest 2024 models. <br/>
<br/>
To allay concerns, in an <a href="https://x.com/Mrwhosetheboss/status/1789286197925237230">interview with Arun Maini</a>, Apple's senior VP of hardware engineering John Ternus reveals that Apple has added a new protective "cowling" over the main logic board. This metal cover not only helps with heat dissipation, but also "effectively creates a central rib that runs through the whole thing and tremendously improves the stiffness of the products," according to Ternus.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt the new iPad Pro models will be subjected to exaggerated pressure tests by some YouTubers, and we are bound to see more than a few bent out of shape in the process. Whether Apple's strengthend iPad Pro chassis will be enough to withstand the pressures of real-world everyday use over time is altogether another matter.<br/>
<br/>
If <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/m4-ipad-pro/">early reviews</a> are anything to go by, a handful of outlets have noted that the devices do feel particularly durable despite their impressive thinness. Do you have lingering doubts? Let us know in the comments. Pricing on the M4 ‌iPad Pro‌ begins at &#36;999, and it can be purchased from Apple's website.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bendgate/">Bendgate</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/ipad-pro-structural-design-avoid-bendgate/">iPad Pro: How Apple Intends to Avoid Another &#039;Bendgate&#039; Controversy</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-how-apple-intends-to-avoid-another-bendgate-controversy.2426284/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest iPad Air and iPad Pro models feature a new Battery Health menu in the Settings app that is not available on older iPads, and which includes options that were once limited to iPhone 15 models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-and-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950313" /><br/>
As confirmed by <em><a href="https://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/batterijconditie-ipads-2024/">iCulture</a></em>, visiting Settings ➝ Battery on the new iPads shows a new Battery Health menu that lists Battery Health (with a readout such as "Normal"), Maximum Capacity, Cycle Count, and a 80% Limit charging optimization option. Users can also see details about when the battery was produced and when it was first used. <br/>
<br/>
Code previously found in iPadOS 17.5 beta software <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/">referenced the Battery Health menu</a>, and it was indeed suggested that it may be limited to Apple's new iPads. Notably, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-battery-cycle-count-iphone-15/">Cycle Count</a> readout and the option to more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-battery-charging-limit/">strictly prevent charging beyond 80%</a> were up until now exclusive features of the iPhone 15 series, and cannot be found on older iPhones either.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iculture-ipad-2024-battery-health-menu.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950589" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: iCulture</em></div><br/>
The 80% Limit is separate from the Optimized Battery Charging feature on earlier iPhones, which intelligently delays charging past 80% until a more appropriate time by learning the device's daily charging routine. When the 80% hard limit is enabled, the iPad will never charge beyond that percentage, except on rare occasions to "maintain accurate battery state-of-charge estimates." Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-asia/108055#:~:text=When%20you%20choose%2080%25%20Limit,reaches%20about%2080%20percent%20again.">says</a> reducing the time that a battery is fully charged can reduce the wear on the battery and improve its lifespan.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/2024-ipad-air-pro-battery-cycle-count/">New iPad Air and iPad Pro Feature Battery Health Menu Including Cycle Count and 80% Charging Limit Option</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-feature-battery-health-menu-including-cycle-count-and-80-charging-limit-option.2426276/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently released iOS 17.5, the newest version of iOS. It brings some major changes to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> if you're in the European Union, and some smaller updates if you're not.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t7bpsFrsyH8" title="iOS 17.5 Out Now: Here&#39;s Everything New!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
In this article, we've rounded up everything new in iOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="app_downloads_from_websites_eu_only">App Downloads From Websites (EU Only)</h2><br/>
iOS 17.5 brings support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/ios-17-5-app-website-downloads-eu/">web-based app distribution</a> in the European Union, letting developers offer their apps for download directly on their websites. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users can download iOS apps from supported websites without using the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/">the iOS 17.4 changes</a> that added alternative app marketplaces, this functionality is limited to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and can only be used in the EU. Developers need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and must have more than one million first installs on iOS in the prior year to offer an app for download.<br/>
<br/>
All apps downloaded from websites onto iPhones must submit to Apple's notarization process, and while there is no commission to pay to Apple, Apple does charge a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee. Though this is only available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; right now, Apple will bring the same functionality to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/ipados-eu-app-changes-fall/">later this year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_news+">Apple News+</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a>+ now has an offline mode that provides access to the Today feed and the News+ tab even without a cellular or Wi-Fi connection.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ includes a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-17-5-apple-news-quartiles-game/">daily word game</a> called Quartiles. The game requires players to combine tiles to form words and earn points. Quartiles is limited to customers who have a paid &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ subscription.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945719" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-17.5-Quartiles-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The scoreboard feature for &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ Puzzles includes new player data for Crossword, Mini Crossword, and Quartiles. Players can see their stats and streaks over time, similar to how The New York Times gaming app works.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="third-party_item_tracker_alerts">Third-Party Item Tracker Alerts</h2><br/>
iOS 17.5 adds support for third-party item trackers, a feature that Apple has been working on since last year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and Google developed a cross-platform solution for unwanted tracking alerts, and iOS 17.5 will let &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users know when a third-party tracker is nearby. "You can disable this item and stop it from sharing its location with the owner. To do this, follow the instructions provided on a website by the manufacturer of this item," reads code in the update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's release notes say that Cross-Platform Tracking Detection has been designed to provide notifications to users if a compatible Bluetooth tracker they do not own is moving with them, regardless of what operating system the device is paired with.<br/>
<br/>
Google launched its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/08/google-android-find-my-device-network-2/">Android-based Find My Device network</a> in April, timed with the initial rollout of Cross-Platform Tracking Detection.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="repair_state">Repair State</h2><br/>
iOS 17.5 includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-17-5-repair-state/">a repair state option</a> that lets an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; be sent in for service without deactivating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> and Activation Lock.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948810" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ios-17-5-repair-state.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
A new "Remove This Device" option is available in &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, and using it with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; puts the device into a repair state mode. Sending a device for repair has historically required turning off &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, which is a way for Apple to ensure that the person requesting a repair owns the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The repair state option leaves &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; turned on, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; continues to be trackable with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app while it is being repaired. An &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; put into a repair state lists that it is "Ready for Repair" in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; device section, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; remains functional while in the repair state.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="podcast_widget">Podcast Widget</h2><br/>
The Podcasts widget that can be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or the Lock screen now features a background that changes depending on the art of the podcast that's being played.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="mobile_device_management">Mobile Device Management</h2><br/>
MDM solutions are able to enforce a beta version during automated device enrollment. Automated device enrollment is designed to simplify initial device setup.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="code_changes">Code Changes</h2><br/>
There were some code changes that we found in the iOS 17.5 beta that reference an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; battery health feature that could possibly be available on the latest iPads. Battery health is not listed as an iPadOS 17.5 feature, so it is not clear if it is a feature that is available or something coming at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
An &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Battery Health menu would likely show maximum remaining capacity and charge cycle count, similar to the Battery Health menu on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There were also references to a "Block All Participants" option for group <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls, possibly for blocking spam, but it also has not been implemented.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="more_on_ios_17">More on iOS 17</h2><br/>
A full rundown on all of the features that are available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">found in our iOS 17 roundup</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-5-features/">iOS 17.5 Features: What&#039;s New in iOS 17.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-5-features-whats-new-in-ios-17-5.2426243/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MacPaw <a href="https://twitter.com/setapp/status/1790073037640941588">today said</a> that its Setapp alternative app marketplace for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> will be launching on Tuesday, May 14 in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938882" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Setapp-iOS.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
A Setapp marketplace has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/setapp-alternative/">in the works</a> since February, which is when Apple first announced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">alternative app downloading options</a> that would be coming in iOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
For those unfamiliar with Setapp, it is a subscription-based service that lets users access dozens of apps for &#36;9.99 per month. Popular apps like Ulysses, iStat Menus, Spark, Unite, Yoink, and more are available through the current subscription service.<br/>
<br/>
According to MacPaw, Setapp will provide a "carefully selected assortment of apps" across categories like productivity, design, lifestyle, utility, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Setapp already offers a &#36;12.49 subscription that provides access to both the iOS and Mac versions of apps, but EU users will be able to access Setapp apps without having to download them through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Setapp will give developers a trusted alternative to &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; distribution with none of the standard fees, though it is worth noting that all apps that exceed 1 million first installs per year must pay the 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apps distributed through alternative app marketplaces are required to submit to a notarization process to ensure they are free from malware, but Apple does not have restrictions on content so apps that might not have been eligible for the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; can be distributed through alternative means.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setapp/">Setapp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/setapp-iphone-marketplace-may-14/">Setapp&#039;s EU Alternative iPhone App Marketplace Launching on May 14</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/setapps-eu-alternative-iphone-app-marketplace-launching-on-may-14.2426241/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For her review of the new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/ipad-pro-vs-macbook-the-great-apple-laptop-tradeoff-3304323d">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>'s Joanna Stern spoke with Tom Boger, Apple's vice president of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac marketing. Stern focused on comparing the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; to a MacBook, and asked some targeted questions about the way Apple views the two devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-1.jpg" alt="" width="1473" height="829" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950180" /><br/>
According to Boger, Apple sees the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and Mac as devices that are meant to be used alongside one another. "We don't see them as competing devices," he said. "We see them as complementary devices." While the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is a "touch-first device," the Mac is designed for "indirect manipulation," with a mouse or keyboard, which is a point that Apple has reiterated several times over the years.<br/>
<br/>
"macOS is for a very different paradigm of computing," he went on to explain after Stern asked about the possibility of running Mac apps on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or a Mac with a touch screen. Boger said that many Apple customers have both devices, and use the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to "extend" Mac work with Continuity.<br/>
<br/>
When asked if Apple would ever change its mind on a touch screen Mac, he didn't say no. "Oh, I can't say we never change our mind," he told Stern.<br/>
<br/>
Stern traded her MacBook for an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for her review, and said that the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; was better for portability, touch, and 5G connectivity, a feature not available on the Mac. The Mac offered superior port options (it has more than one), better software and multitasking, longer battery life, and better multi-display support.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Some new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models appear to have an issue with HDR content in select shades of blue, according to a review from <em><a href="https://www.imore.com/ipad/ipad-pro/exclusive-ipad-pro-oled-display-has-a-weird-hdr-highlights-bug-apple-is-trying-to-squash">iMore</a></em>. The site found that some blue colors cause HDR highlights to blow out and appear nearly white, a defect that can be spotted in the form of compression artifacts in sample images.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/imore-ipad-pro-compression-issue.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950574" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Image via <a href="https://www.imore.com/ipad/ipad-pro/exclusive-ipad-pro-oled-display-has-a-weird-hdr-highlights-bug-apple-is-trying-to-squash">iMore</a></div></em><blockquote>In a relatively specific set of circumstances, HDR highlights are blown out on certain blue shades including navy and indigo to a point that they almost appear white on screen. The best way to spot it would be to look at a character wearing a navy blue shirt -- the creases appear to shimmer, like a spider's web placed over the surface; at other times it appears like an inky blob morphing over it.</blockquote><em>iMore</em> said that the problem is visible "under very specific circumstances" and it can't be seen on other OLED devices such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. It's also a bug that is hard to spot most of the time, and there's no clear reason why it's happening.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models were the star of last week's event, Apple also introduced a refreshed version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>. The new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is set to come out on Wednesday, May 15, and prior to launch, members of the media have shared their first &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; impressions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M2-iPad-Air-Hero-Feature-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949533" /><br/>
For the most part, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is the same as the prior-generation model, with one major exception: the screen size. Apple now has a 10.9-inch version and a 12.9-inch version, so the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; lineup is similar to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; lineup. Both versions are equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip and lack the higher-quality display of the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Larger Size</h2><br/>
The 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; weighs less than the prior-generation 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; at 1.36 pounds vs 1.5 pounds, but it's not as light as the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-air-2024-review-of-course-this-is-the-ipad-to-get-210019225.html">Engadget</a></em> said that the 13-inch model offers a solid option for someone who "wants a big display" without spending &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; money.<br/>
<blockquote>That doesn't sound like a major difference, but it's been just enough for me to feel more comfortable using the Air as a tablet rather than just docked in a keyboard case. It's still a little more unwieldy than I'd like, and it's still heavier and thicker than the new 13-inch iPad Pro. But, the iPad Air is &#36;500 cheaper; at that price, I'm willing to accept a little trade-off.</blockquote><br/>
While the 13-inch model is new, the 11-inch model is indistinguishable from the 10.9-inch model in terms of design. It is worth noting that Apple is just rounding differently for its size options, and there is no actual difference in screen size.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/ipad-air-review-in-progress-the-ipad-pro-you-should-buy/">CNET</a></em> pointed out that the "Air" name has lost its meaning because the Pro is the thinner and lighter tablet.<br/>
<blockquote>The first Apple "Air" device, the MacBook Air, was called Air because it was super thin. Don't apply this logic to the iPad Air, because the iPad Pro is actually thinner. The iPad Air is far from chunky, though; it's the same-looking tablet as previous iPad Pro or Air models. I'm just here to say maybe I agree that the term "Air" has lost its meaning (unless we're talking about it just being lighter in features and performance). I'd suggest getting rid of the "Air" name and call it the iPad Pro, and then change the iPad Pro to the iPad Ultra.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<h2>M2 Chip</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is the same chip in the prior-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024">The Verge</a></em> said it's a "fast and reliable chip" and it runs the same in the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; as it did in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, according to benchmarking tests.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/m2-ipad-air-review-the-everything-ipad/">Ars Technica</a></em> said that the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip is a "solid generational jump up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>," and that the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; was "already generally overkill" for most <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> apps. The &zwnj;M2&zwnj; is "unquestionably powerful enough to do everything people currently use iPads to do."<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Display Quality</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; has an LCD display that is not as good as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> display or the prior-generation 12.9-inch mini-LED &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; display, but it's "more than bright enough for indoor use," according to <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-air-2024-review-of-course-this-is-the-ipad-to-get-210019225.html">Engadget</a></em>. The main downside is the lack of a higher frame rate and no support for ProMotion technology.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-ipad-air-2024">Mashable</a></em> compared the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to the &zwnj;OLED &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro&zwnj; and said that it can be difficult to tell the difference in good lighting, but in "challenging lighting situations" like a brightly lit office or outdoors, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; display is much better.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Other Features</h2><br/>
The relocated camera on the landscape edge is a solid quality of life improvement, and <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-air-2024-review-of-course-this-is-the-ipad-to-get-210019225.html">Engadget</a></em> said that it's actually useful for video calling.<br/>
<blockquote>That camera is basically the same as the one in the last iPad Air, but now that it's on the landscape edge it's much better for video calling when you're using it with a keyboard. I'd actually consider taking work calls with the iPad now, something that wasn't the case before.</blockquote><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024">The Verge</a></em> said that the relocated camera is about the only noticeable change to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<blockquote>Apple moved the front-facing camera to the middle of the landscape edge, which means I can use it for video calls without looking like I'm always staring up and away from the screen. This is a great change, and one Apple should have made a long time ago. If you do want to buy an Air, I'd recommend this one over the previous generation just to get the camera in the right place.</blockquote><br/>
Another bonus is the 128GB starting storage space, up from 64GB in the prior-generation model, along with the option for 1TB of maximum storage.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life is listed as 10 hours, but <em><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-ipad-air-2024">Mashable</a></em> was able to get a full 13 hours from a single charge when watching TikTok videos.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Cost</h2><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-air-2024-review-of-course-this-is-the-ipad-to-get-210019225.html">Engadget</a></em> said that the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; offers 80 percent of the Pro experience at a more affordable price, and <em>TechCrunch</em> said that while the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is the best tablet if money is no concern, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is a good option when money matters and for non-creatives. More importantly, "paying MacBook prices for an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is a bridge too far."<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024">The Verge</a></em> said that the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is a "study in tradeoffs," describing it as a "Goldilocks" &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The &#36;250 cheaper standard &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is "just about as good at every common &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; activity" and a better option for casual users. Exceptions include users who want a big screen or who use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> often, as the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; supports the new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro.<br/>
<blockquote>If you're just looking for a way to send emails, browse the web, play games, and maybe make an iMovie or two, none of that will really change the way you use your iPad. An iPad is an iPad is an iPad, and until Apple either fixes a bunch of things or opens up the operating system -- and I wouldn't hold my breath on either one -- you just aren't going to get enough out of all that extra power to make it a must-have upgrade.</blockquote><br/>
<h2>More Info</h2><br/>
Pricing on the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;599, and it can be ordered from Apple's website.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models are set to be delivered to customers starting on Wednesday, May 15, and ahead of that date, members of the media have shared their opinions on the device in official reviews.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950292" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m4-ipad-pro-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Written Reviews</h2><br/>
With M4 chips, OLED displays, and a thin and light design, the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models mark a significant upgrade over the prior-generation versions.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M4 Chip Performance</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is equipped with Apple's next-generation M4 chip, and as <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html?src=rss">Engadget</a></em> points out, it offers "more power than almost anyone buying an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> will know what to do with."<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/ipad-pro-m4-review-peformance-battery-life-1851470600">Gizmodo</a></em> said the M4 "feels more like a fork of the M3 than real new hardware." As an example, an Octane X rendering test took 1 minute and 53 seconds with the M4, and the same test on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with M3 chip took 57 seconds.<br/>
<blockquote>If I run Octane X on the latest MacBook Air 15 with the same amount of RAM as my review copy of the iPad Pro, it will run down the screw scene in about 57 seconds. There aren't many ways to compare Apples to Apples from a tablet ecosystem to a full-fledged Mac. For one, the iPad doesn't have an easy, established way of tracking framerates in games. But for the sake of argument, I loaded up Resident Evil 4 on iPad Pro 2024, iPad Pro 2022, and the M3 MacBook Air. All ran with a relatively solid performance on the default low-to-mid settings. There are no graphics options on the iPad, but the two look identical across the older and new tablets.</blockquote><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review">The Verge</a></em>, the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; scored 50 percent higher than the M3 version in benchmark tests, but while it feels faster, it doesn't feel 50 percent faster. There likely isn't a way to tell the difference between the 9-core and 10-core M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<blockquote>Apps load and close a half-beat faster with the M4, even complex games run perfectly smooth (I still can't believe how good Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile looks on this device), and iMovie renders video noticeably more quickly than on the 11-inch M2 Pro I've been using for a couple of years. Individually, these aren't earth-shattering upgrades, but particularly if you're doing a lot of intense photo and video work or even love a long Warzone session, it's a real performance bump.</blockquote><br/>
<h3>Software</h3><br/>
Despite the incredible performance that the M4 chip brings, reviewers pointed out the shortcomings of iPadOS. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/05/m4_ipad_pro_review/"><em>Six Colors</em>' Jason Snell</a> said that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is able to "handle pretty much any task it's capable of executing," but that it's "let down by iPadOS limitations."<br/>
<br/>
Longtime &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; user <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/not-an-ipad-pro-review/">Federico Viticci of <em>MacStories</em></a> didn't share a full review of the new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, but he penned a piece pointing out the many shortcomings of iPadOS. It's well worth a read to see what it's like using an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as a main machine, with highlights on the pain points of multitasking, limited apps, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/ipad-pro-vs-macbook-the-great-apple-laptop-tradeoff-3304323d?mod=rss_Technology">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>'s Joanna Stern said that using the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is like "driving a Ferrari on a golf course" because the iPhone-based operating system hampers what the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; could be capable of doing.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/ipad-pro-m4-review-peformance-battery-life-1851470600">Gizmodo</a></em> said that despite the creativity apps available on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, it "still isn't direct competition for the versatility of a MacBook" and it's not a good platform for those who want to "multitask on multiple windows."<br/>
<br/>
Almost every review mentioned the shortcomings of iPadOS as the major fault with the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>OLED Display</h3><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html?src=rss">Engadget</a></em> said that the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is "incredibly bright, sharp, and vibrant" regardless of task. Going from an LCD to OLED is a massive upgrade, but updating from the mini-LED model won't feel quite as impressive.<br/>
<blockquote>Everything is incredibly bright, sharp and vibrant, whether I'm browsing the web, editing photos, watching movies or playing games. I cannot stress enough how delightful this screen is -- I have a flight this week, and I can't wait to spend it watching movies. Watching a selection of scenes from Interstellar shows off the HDR capabilities as well as the contrast between the blackness of space and the brightness of surrounding stars and galaxies, while more vibrant scenes like the Shire in Fellowship of the Ring had deep and gorgeous colors without feeling overly saturated or unrealistic.</blockquote><br/>
<em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/13/apple-ipad-pro-m4-vs-ipad-air-m2-which-is-right-for-most/">TechCrunch</a></em> said that the optional nano-texture matte add-on brought an "extra level of tactility" and "welcome friction" to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display when using it with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>. The OLED display is noticeably brighter than the LCD display of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, but it may not be an upgrade worth &#36;500 for most users.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review">The Verge</a></em> said that the OLED display "works beautifully" and that colors can even look like they have too much HDR. It can also have more glare and reflection than expected.<br/>
<blockquote>All of the traditional upsides of OLED are immediately apparent: since OLEDs control each pixel individually, you get much richer blacks, so the letterboxes above and below a video just disappear into the bezel, and photos look much more dynamic. Colors are incredibly vibrant -- to the point of occasionally looking too contrasty and HDR-y to my eyes. The Pro's peak brightness is significantly brighter than the new Air, too, which is tough to pull off with an OLED.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Design</h3><br/>
Jason Snell of <em>Six Colors</em> said that while the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s internals have been updated, it <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/05/m4_ipad_pro_review/">looks a lot like</a> a "thinner version of the 2018-era design." It's a "good design" that didn't need to be updated, but the lighter weight makes it less awkward to hold in one hand.<br/>
<br/>
There continues to be just one Thunderbolt 4 port that limits connecting external devices and charging at the same time without a dock.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html?src=rss"><em>Engadget</em></a> went further and said that the thinner design and lighter weight "radically" changes the experience of holding the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it's now comfortable to use as a hand-held tablet.<br/>
<blockquote>But with something like an iPad, where you're meant to pick it up, hold it and touch it, shaving off a quarter of a pound and 20 percent of its thickness actually makes a huge difference in the experience of using the product. It's more comfortable and easier to use -- and, provided that there are no durability concerns here, this is a major improvement.</blockquote><br/>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review"><em>The Verge</em></a> said that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is the "closest thing" to the vision that a tablet should feel "like a piece of glass in your hand."<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/gadgets-tech/laptops-tablets/ipad-pro-m4-2024-review-b2544053.html">The Independent</a></em> said that the thin design is the most noticeable &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; feature, and though it's thin, it's durable.<blockquote>The larger of the two iPad Pro models takes your breath away. At 5.1mm thick, it's not only much thinner than the last large Pro model, which was 6.4mm thick, it's actually thinner than any product Apple has made before. Let that sink in. It's thinner than the tiny iPod nano, though Apple says it's as tough and durable as before. In the hand, there's no flex or creaking even if you try to twist it.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard</h3><br/>
<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/05/m4_ipad_pro_review/"><em>Six Colors</em>' Jason Snell</a> said that the Magic Keyboard is an improvement over the original model thanks to the full function row, the larger trackpad, and the addition of haptic feedback. With aluminum, it feels "a bit more like one of Apple's laptops."<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html?src=rss">Engadget</a></em> said that the Magic Keyboard is thinner and lighter than before, for a more compact and portable feel.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.imore.com/ipad/apple-pencil-pro-review">iMore</a></em>, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro's squeeze gesture saves wasted hand movements and simplifies navigation, while the barrel roll option allows for flourishes and sweeps in supported software.<br/>
<h3>Other Features</h3><br/>
Apple moved the camera to the landscape edge of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; rather than the portrait edge, which means video calls are now in the appropriate orientation when the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is connected to a keyboard, and that's a feature reviewers liked. <em>CNBC</em> said the camera is "finally in the right place."<br/>
<blockquote>The camera is finally in the right place. It's along the landscape edge of the iPad so that, when it's propped up, it's dead center for FaceTime calls. It used to be on the top of the iPad, forcing that awkward glance to the side during video calls. The quality was nice and clear during my tests and I like that the camera, using the Center Stage features, followed me as I moved around the room.</blockquote><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.imore.com/ipad/ipad-pro-2024-review">iMore</a></em> commented on the speakers and said that they "sound pretty good" both for watching TV shows and for video calls.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple reviews also covered battery life, and said that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; gets the expected 10 hours that Apple advertises.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released an updated version of Logic Pro, introducing all of the new features that were previewed last week. New versions of both Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro were announced alongside the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models last Tuesday, and the updates are available for Mac and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-logic-pro-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="901" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949469" /><br/>
Logic Pro has new AI-based studio assistant features that help artists make music, with these options joining Smart Tempo and the Pitch Correction plug-in. Session Players expand the Drummer capabilities in Logic Pro, with Apple adding a new Bass Player and Keyboard Player. Session Players are able to follow the same chord progression using Global chord track.<br/>
<br/>
With a new ChromaGlow feature, users can dial in the perfect tone and choose from five different saturation styles to add warmth, presence, and punch to tracks by simulating the sound of vintage analog hardware.<br/>
<br/>
Audio files can be separated into stems for vocals, drums, bass, and other parts using the Stem Splitter feature. Separating tracks is aimed at making it easier to apply effects, add new parts, and change the mix. There are also updates for Sound Library, Spatial Audio, and other features with Apple's full notes available below.<blockquote><strong>AI Enhanced Tools</strong><br/>
- New AI enhanced tools join Smart Tempo and the Pitch Correction plug-in to augment your artistry<br/>
- Bass Player and Keyboard Player join Drummer to complete a set of Session Players -- all built with AI making it easy to create performances that respond to your direction<br/>
- Session Players can follow the same chord progression using Global chord track<br/>
- Add warmth to any track with ChromaGlow, an advanced plug-in with five saturation models designed to simulate the sound of vintage analog hardware. Requires M1 chip or later.<br/>
- Separate a stereo audio file into stems for vocals, drums, bass and other parts with Stem Splitter. Requires M1 chip or later.<br/>
- Session Players, ChromaGlow, and Stem Splitter also come to Logic Pro for iPad 2 -- making it simple to move between projects created in Logic Pro for Mac<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Sound Library</strong><br/>
- Play any of six deeply-sampled acoustic and electric basses with Studio Bass<br/>
- Perform any of three meticulously-sampled pianos with Studio Piano<br/>
- Loops that contain chord tags will automatically populate the chord track when added to a project<br/>
- Three new Producer Packs are available: Hardwell, The Kount, and Cory Wong<br/>
- Original multi-track project of "Swing!" by Ellie Dixon available as in-app demo song<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Spatial Audio</strong><br/>
- Downmix and trim options allow custom mixing for non-Atmos channel configurations<br/>
- Exported ADM BWF files have been expanded beyond Dolby Atmos and can contain settings for stereo and other multi-channel formats<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Enhancements</strong><br/>
- Bounce in place adds automatic realtime recording for External Instrument regions or tracks that utilize external hardware using Logic's I/O plug-in<br/>
- MIDI generated by supported software instruments and effects can be routed to the input of other tracks for creative layering during playback or recording<br/>
- Edit more efficiently using key commands for moving, extending, or resizing marquee selections</blockquote>These features are available for Logic Pro on the Mac, with Session Players, ChromaGlow, Stem Splitter, and the new Sound Library options also available on Logic Pro 2 for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The updated version of Logic Pro is free for existing users, and &#36;200 for new users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/logic-pro/">Logic Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-releases-logic-pro-ai-update/">Apple Releases Logic Pro for Mac and iPad Updates With New AI Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-logic-pro-for-mac-and-ipad-updates-with-new-ai-features.2426228/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">updated the iPad Pro with the M4 chip</a>, marking the first time that it introduced an M-series chip in an iPad instead of a Mac. However, the first Macs equipped with the M4 chip will allegedly be released in a matter of months.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-Mac-Mini-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946149" /><br/>
In his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-12/who-will-run-apple-after-cook-leaves-a-look-at-company-s-succession-challenge-lw3j2t5z"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> on Sunday, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the MacBook Pro and Mac mini will be updated with the M4 series of chips later this year. Specifically, he expects a 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip, 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, and Mac mini models with M4 and M4 Pro chips.<br/>
<br/>
He expects the MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro to be updated with M4-series chips throughout 2025, but he did not mention the iMac.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/when-are-m4-macs-launching/">already shared a roadmap for M4 Macs</a>, but he was more definitive this time with his claim that the first Macs with the M4 chip will be released later this year, rather than at some point between late 2024 and early 2025. October is a common month for Apple to release new Macs, so the MacBook Pro and Mac mini could be updated in around five months from now if Gurman's timeframes prove to be accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench 6 results show that the M4 chip is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/m4-ipad-pro-cpu-benchmark/">up to 25% faster than the M3 chip</a> for multi-core CPU performance. Manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, the M4 chip is also more power efficient than the M3 chip.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[At its Spring Update event, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-and-more-tools-to-chatgpt-free/">announced</a> that it will be releasing a desktop app for the Mac, as seen in the screenshot below. The app will be rolling out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers starting today, ahead of a wider launch "in the coming weeks." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ChatGPT-for-Mac.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950485" /><br/>
"With a simple keyboard shortcut (Option + Space), you can instantly ask ChatGPT a question," OpenAI's press release says. In addition, Voice Mode will allow you to have voice conversations with ChatGPT directly from your Mac.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI already offers ChatGPT apps <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatgpt/id6448311069">for the iPhone and iPad</a>, and it plans to release a Windows version of the desktop app later this year.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI is also making some updates to ChatGPT's web interface, introducing a new home screen, a redesigned message layout, and more. The new look is "designed to be friendlier and more conversational," the company said.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ChatGPT-Web.jpg" alt="" width="1278" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950511" /><br/>
OpenAI also announced that it will be making its <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">all-new GPT-4o large language model</a> available for free, meaning that no ChatGPT Plus subscription will be required to use it. OpenAI says GPT-4o provides "GPT-4-level intelligence," but is "much faster and improves on its capabilities across text, voice, and vision." Until now, users without a ChatGPT Plus subscription have been limited to the older GPT-3.5 model.<br/>
<br/>
It was recently reported that Apple is in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-finalizing-deal-openai-chatgpt-ios-18/">final stages of discussions with OpenAI</a> to integrate ChatGPT on the iPhone starting with iOS 18, which is expected to be unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">next month</a>. iOS 18 is also rumored to feature many new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-working-on-on-device-llm/">on-device AI features</a> from Apple directly.<br/>

The update comes two months after the 17.4 &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; software release, which introduced new features for music preferences.<br/>

Apple does not specify what's included in the ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌ 17.5 software, and the generic release notes only say that it brings stability and performance improvements.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ software is installed automatically on the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌ unless the feature is disabled‌‌‌‌, but the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ can also be manually updated in the Home app by following the instructions in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/homepod-software-update/">HomePod‌‌ update how to</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-5/">Apple Releases HomePod Software 17.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-5.2426209/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released tvOS 17.5, the fifth update update to the tvOS 17 operating system that came out last September. tvOS 17.5 comes two months after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-tvos-17-4/">release of tvOS 17.4</a>.<br/>
<br/>

tvOS 17.5 can be downloaded using the Settings app on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>‌. Go to System > Software Update to get the new software. ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ owners who have automatic software updates activated will be upgraded to tvOS 17.5 automatically.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to other operating system updates, tvOS 17.5 updates are often minor in scale, focusing on bug fixes and other small improvements. We did not find new features during the tvOS 17.5 beta testing process.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares release notes for tvOS <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106336">in its tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each new version of tvOS comes out.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-releases-tvos-17-5/">Apple Releases tvOS 17.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-tvos-17-5.2426208/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
