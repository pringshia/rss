		<description><![CDATA[EU developers can now add alternative app marketplaces to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Connect, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/">Apple said today</a>. Apple is also accepting submissions for the Notarization process, which is required for all apps that will be distributed through alternative marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Apple is making these changes to &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect ahead of the launch of iOS 17.4, an update that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">overhauls the app ecosystem in the European Union</a>. Alternative app marketplaces are special iOS apps that can be downloaded onto an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> from a website or a web browser, serving as an alternative to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. App marketplaces are able to distribute iOS apps, giving developers a way to sell their apps without using the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Both alternative marketplaces and apps that are added to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; through one of the marketplaces are checked over by Apple to prevent malware, viruses, and similar malicious content.<br/>
<br/>
To add an alternative app marketplace or submit an app for Notarization, developers must <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=e59yuu15">agree to Apple's new business terms</a>. The business terms include a Core Technology Fee that requires app marketplaces to pay .50 euros per install, and apps to pay the same fee after 1 million installs.<br/>
<br/>
With alternative app marketplaces able to be added to &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect, marketplace distribution and marketplace apps can be set up, and TestFlight can be used to beta test new features.<br/>
<br/>
TestFlight also supports apps that use alternative browser engines and alternative payments through third-party payment providers.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-connect/">App Store Connect</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/app-store-connect-alternative-app-marketplaces/">Apple Starts Letting Developers Add Alternative App Marketplaces to App Store Connect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-starts-letting-developers-add-alternative-app-marketplaces-to-app-store-connect.2418959/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is currently testing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.1, the first major update to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 updates Personas, and multiple reports suggest the software makes Personas look better than before. We thought we'd take a closer look at Personas in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1, comparing the update to the prior &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.2 software.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEixxDkYXlo" title="Apple Vision Pro Persona FIXED in visionOS 1.1?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Personas are a key feature on the Vision Pro, representing the user in video calls on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, Zoom, and other platforms. Personas are a digital representation of the Vision Pro wearer, and are captured using the headset itself. With the Vision Pro, the wearer takes a 3D facial scan that captures their facial structure, expressions, hand movements, and more. Apple describes a Persona as an "authentic spatial representation" of a person.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released Personas in a beta capacity, and it's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-vision-pro-personas-deeply-weird/">not hard to see why</a> with the Personas that have been shared on the initial versions of the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; software. Reviewers have called personas "deeply weird," "deep in the uncanny valley," "ridiculous," and "frightening."<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1, Personas have more natural looking eyes, skin tone improvements, and more detail that adds realism, though Apple's scanning feature still struggles with hair.<br/>
<br/>
Most Personas are noticeably better with the 1.1 update, but Apple still needs to do a lot of work to eliminate the otherworldly, unnatural vibe that the virtual representations give off. &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 is available to developers in beta right now, and it will likely see a launch in March alongside iOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds Contact Key Verification, support for resetting the headset without a computer, and support for mobile device management.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/testing-personas-visionos-1-1/">Testing Improved Vision Pro Personas in visionOS 1.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-improved-vision-pro-personas-in-visionos-1-1.2418951/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The latest Tesla software adds Ultra Wideband support (UWB) to improve the function of the built-in Phone Key feature in the Tesla app (via <em><a href="https://teslanorth.com/2024/02/08/tesla-phone-key-iphone-ultra-wideband/">Tesla North</a></em>). Tesla owners can use Phone Key to lock and unlock their vehicles without a physical key.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/tesla-red-orange-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1560" height="827" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-776244" /><br/>
Ultra Wideband support provides more precise tracking capabilities than Bluetooth, which means the Phone Key feature will better recognize when an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is near a vehicle to unlock/lock it at the appropriate time. From the release notes:<br/>
<blockquote>Ultrawide band (UWB) technology is now available for Phone Key. So your vehicle and Phone Key can communicate with greater accuracy to more responsively lock, unlock, and open Automatic Doors.</blockquote><br/>
Tesla owners will need both a vehicle that supports Ultra Wideband and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with Ultra Wideband to take advantage of the new capabilities. Enabling the updated UWB key requires going to the Phone Key section of the Tesla app (which must be upgraded to version 4.29.5) and following the upgrade steps.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tesla/">Tesla</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/tesla-app-ultra-wideband/">Tesla App Gains Ultra Wideband Support to Improve Phone Keys</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tesla-app-gains-ultra-wideband-support-to-improve-phone-keys.2418945/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular password management app LastPass <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2024/02/warning-fraudulent-app-impersonating-lastpass-currently-available-in-apple-app-store/">is warning customers</a> about a fraudulent app that uses a similar name and icon to attempt to trick LastPass customers into using the fake app instead of the real app (via <em><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-lastpass-password-manager-spotted-on-apples-app-store/">Bleeping Computer</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/lasspass-fake-password-manager-app.jpg" alt="" width="2838" height="1596" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935681" /><br/>
The "LassPass Password Manager" app was somehow approved by Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> review team, even though it appears to clearly mimic the LastPass app. It doesn't use exactly the same icon and the name is a letter off, but the similarities could confuse some LastPass users.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if the fake LassPass app is attempting to steal login information from users, but it does have options for adding passwords, email accounts, addresses, bank accounts, credit cards, debit cards, and more. It doesn't ask for a LastPass login of any kind, but it is possible that the developer can see information added to the app.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a "PRO" upgrade that costs &#36;1.99 per month, &#36;9.99 per year, or &#36;49.99 for a "lifetime" subscription, so the aim of the app may be collecting subscription money from customers. Either way, LastPass users should be aware of the fake app and should avoid it. At best it is aiming to steal money, and at worst, it is stealing passwords and credit card information.<br/>
<br/>
Clone apps often make their way into the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, but the app impersonating LastPass is particularly concerning because it could be accessing sensitive information. It is not clear how an app mimicking one of the most popular password management apps was approved by Apple, and its discovery comes at a critical time for the company.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/phil-schiller-on-risks-of-iphone-app-marketplaces/">promoting the safety and security</a> of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; as it prepares to allow for alternate app marketplaces in the European Union, and allowing a fake password management app onto the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; is not a good look.<br/>
<br/>
LastPass says that it is working to get the clone app removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Though LastPass published its alert yesterday, and presumably contacted Apple at the same time, the app remains in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; as of now.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is continuing to hype the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Super Bowl Halftime Show that's set to air this weekend, with the company sharing a full mini film for its "Where's Usher?" ad campaign.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Where's Usher? Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show (Official Film)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdfh6ZUvwVw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Yesterday, Apple shared a small teaser of the skit starring Ludacris, Lil Jon, Taraji P. Henson, and Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, but today the full 7-minute spot is available to watch on YouTube. Additional stars show up in the longer version, including Wesley Snipes, J Balvin, Anderson .Paak, Blue Man Group, and Criss Angel.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following a few <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/best-buy-10th-gen-ipad/">deals on the 10th generation iPad</a> we shared this morning, Best Buy today is also discounting a <a href="https://howl.me/clALCPUyRxf">collection of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro notebooks</a>. Some of these deals require a <a href="https://howl.me/clALDJVZyQF">My Best Buy Plus or Total membership</a>, which are available from &#36;49.99/year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Air</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/macbook-air-blue-feb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935647" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the 13-inch M1 MacBook Air, Best Buy has the 256GB model for <a href="https://howl.me/clALl0A1vd6"><strong>&#36;749.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;999.99. This is a match of the all-time low price on the M1 MacBook Air, and it's available in Gold, Space Gray, and Silver.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clALl0A1vd6"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;250 OFF</div>M1 MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;749.99</div></a></div><h2>MacBook Pro</h2><br/>

<br/>
There are a few more MacBook Pro models on sale compared to the MacBook Air deal, and these are also at all-time low prices. It's worth noting that the MacBook Pro deals will require you to have a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership in order to see the record low prices, but even without one you can find some solid second-best prices on Best Buy.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with the M3 512GB 14-inch MacBook Pro, you can get this model for <a href="https://howl.me/clALsjD0UdF"><strong>&#36;1,399.00</strong></a> with a My Best Buy Plus/Total membership, down from &#36;1,599.00. The M3 Pro 512GB 14-inch MacBook Pro is on sale for <a href="https://howl.me/clALtdDDDQt"><strong>&#36;1,749.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,999.00, which is a best-ever deal we haven't tracked since the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: My Best Buy Plus/Total membership required to see final deal price.</strong></em></div><br/>

<br/>
Moving to 16-inch models, Best Buy has the M3 Pro 512GB/18GB Memory 16-inch MacBook Pro for <a href="https://howl.me/clALyhaPV7d"><strong>&#36;2,249.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;2,499.00. You can also get the M3 Pro 512GB/36GB Memory 16-inch MacBook Pro for <a href="https://howl.me/clALzNTz4c4"><strong>&#36;2,649.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;2,899.00. Similar to the 14-inch notebooks, these are some of the best discounts we've ever tracked on the MacBook Pro.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While most reports so far have agreed that the next iPhone SE will have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-se-4-iphone-14-chassis/">similar design as the standard iPhone 14 model</a>, which has a notch for Face ID, a sketchy rumor now says that the device will instead feature the Dynamic Island.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-SE-Dynamic-Island-Majin-Bu.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935672" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>iPhone SE with Dynamic Island mockup by <a href="https://twitter.com/upintheozone">@upintheozone</a></em></div><br/>
This latest claim comes <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1755615656400294225">from the leaker @MajinBuOfficial on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter. In addition to the Dynamic Island, he said the next iPhone SE could have a vertical rear camera bump like the one <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">rumored for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</a>, but with one camera instead of two. Based on the information he shared, the rear microphone and LED flash would be positioned below the camera lens in a pill-shaped bump.<br/>
<br/>
@MajinBuOfficial recently shared alleged iPhone 16 schematics that are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">believed to be accurate</a>. However, he has a mixed track record with Apple rumors, and he cautioned that this iPhone SE information is still unconfirmed for now. In addition, Apple is likely prototyping multiple iPhone SE models, and it may not have finalized a design.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPhone SE is expected to launch in 2025, around three years after the current model was released, but this timeframe could change.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/iphone-se-dynamic-island-rumor/">Sketchy Rumor Says Next iPhone SE Will Feature Dynamic Island Instead of Notch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sketchy-rumor-says-next-iphone-se-will-feature-dynamic-island-instead-of-notch.2418916/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17.4 Nerfs Web Apps in the EU</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has seemingly restricted the functionality of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in the latest beta of iOS 17.4, specifically targeting users within the European Union. The move appears to undermine the role of PWAs as viable alternatives to native apps in iOS.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932464" /><br/>
As first flagged by <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/did-apple-just-break-web-apps-in-ios17.4-beta-eu/">Open Web Advocacy</a>, the second beta release of iOS 17.4 seems to introduce changes that put web apps at a significant disadvantage in Europe. The new beta version of iOS prevents these apps from launching in their own top-level window that takes up the entire screen, relegating them instead to open within Safari, a change that significantly impacts their user experience and functionality. The move effectively demotes PWAs to mere website shortcuts.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when a user in Europe taps a web app icon, they will see a system message asking if they wish to open it in Safari or cancel. The message adds that the web app "will open in your default browser from now on." When opened in Safari, the web app opens like a bookmark, with no dedicated windowing, notifications, or long-term local storage. Users have seen issues with existing web apps such as data loss, since the Safari version can no longer access local data, as well as broken notifications.<br/>
<br/>
Progressive Web Apps are designed to offer a user experience comparable to that of native apps using web technologies, with the potential for users to add them directly to their home screen with no need for an app store. The latest change is particularly controversial because historically Apple has suggested that developers who are unwilling to comply with its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> guidelines could instead focus on web apps. Now, the company's recent adjustments appear to contradict this stance by limiting the capabilities of PWAs and their ability to compete with native applications in iOS, raising questions about its commitment to supporting web technologies as a viable alternative to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
This development comes amid Apple's moves to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to promote competition and regulate the practices of digital "gatekeepers." Apple's decision to alter the functionality of PWAs specifically in the EU could be interpreted as an attempt to navigate the regulatory landscape imposed by the DMA, but it may simply want to prevent users in Europe from using web apps with alternative browser engines. The company has not yet commented on its motivations.<br/>
<br/>
There are indications that iOS 17.4 is using SIM carrier information to geo-lock the changes to web app functionality singularly to users in the EU. Web apps in other regions around the world remain unaffected.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu/">iOS 17.4 Nerfs Web Apps in the EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu.2418904/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

"The U.S. government has a significant role to play in setting the standards and developing the tools we need to mitigate the risks and harness the immense potential of artificial intelligence," Raimondo said in a statement.<br/>
<br/>
The group will work with the department's National Institute of Standards and Technology on priority actions outlined in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">President Biden's AI executive order</a>, "including developing guidelines for red-teaming, capability evaluations, risk management, safety and security, and watermarking synthetic content."<br/>
<br/>
Other technology companies, as well as civil society groups, academics, and state and local government officials, will also be involved to establish safety standards regarding AI regulation. <br/>
<br/>
Generative AI has spurred excitement due to its potential to enhance creativity, improve efficiency, and advance technology. However, fears surrounding generative AI include ethical concerns like deepfakes, the potential impact on jobs, issues around information reliability, and challenges in ensuring privacy and effective regulation. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be spending <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">millions of dollars a day</a> on AI research as training large language models requires a lot of hardware. Apple is on track to spend <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-ai-server-spending-2024/">more than &#36;4 billion</a> on AI servers in 2024, according to one report.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">developing its own generative AI model</a> called "Ajax". Designed to rival the likes of OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4, Ajax operates on 200 billion parameters, suggesting a high level of complexity and capability in language understanding and generation. Internally known as "Apple GPT," Ajax aims to unify machine learning development across Apple, suggesting a broader strategy to integrate AI more deeply into Apple's ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
Aspects of the model could be incorporated into iOS 18, such as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">enhanced version of Siri</a> with ChatGPT-like generative AI functionality. Both <em>The Information</em> and analyst Jeff Pu claim that Apple will have some kind of generative AI feature available on the ‌iPhone‌ and iPad <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">later this year</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/apple-ai-safety-institute-consortium/">Apple Joins US Commerce Department&#039;s AI Safety Institute Consortium</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-joins-us-commerce-departments-ai-safety-institute-consortium.2418893/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Waterfield has announced its own <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/vision-pro-shield-case">Vision Pro Shield Case</a>, a more compact alternative to Apple's official <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2F3LL/A/apple-vision-pro-travel-case">&#36;199 Travel Case</a> for the company's new headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/waterfield-apple-vision-pro-case.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935581" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple's Vision Pro Travel Case (left) versus Waterfield case</em></div><br/>
At half the size of Apple's case, Waterfield says its Shield Case travels more easily, while still providing the necessary protection and capacity for organizing and carrying related accessories in transit. It achieves this by taking advantage of the Vision Pro's detachable parts.<br/>
<blockquote>WaterField leveraged the ease with which the Vision Pro head straps can be removed to significantly reduce the size of its Vision Pro Shield Case. The new Apple headset, with its front cover on, sits cradled on one side, and a padded accessory pouch — for the charger, cables, cleaning cloth, one or both head straps, and Zeiss lenses in Ultrasuede® pockets — rests perfectly inside the curve of the headset on the other. This design not only saves space but also keeps the headset firmly in place, and the pouch's padding adds yet another extra layer of protection.</blockquote><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/waterfield-vision-pro-case.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935578" /><br/>
<br/>
A padded battery pocket under the flap is positioned to keep the battery's weight away from the headset (users can detach the battery from the cable using a SIM tray ejector tool), while an external zippered pocket can be used for additional accessories and includes a stealth <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> pocket.<br/>
<br/>
The 5-liter case is surrounded by impact-resistant closed-cell foam and lined with a padded fleece. A dual-sided waterproof YKK zipper surrounds the case on three sides and is backed by a fleece bumper, which shields the contents from the zipper. There's also a low-profile handle on the case, and D-rings for hooking an optional shoulder strap.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will not have to face an investor lawsuit accusing it of overpaying CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and other top executives by tens of millions of dollars, after a federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the case (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-defeats-lawsuit-claiming-it-overpaid-ceo-tim-cook-others-2024-02-07/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Tim-Cook-WWDC-Stage.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894652" /><br/>
The plaintiff, a pension fund affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said Apple in 2021 and 2022 awarded a respective &#36;92.7 million and &#36;94 million to Cook and four other executives by improperly calculating the value of performance-based stock awards.  The plaintiff argued its compensation committee intended to award just &#36;77.5 million each year.<br/>
<br/>
The alleged error was attributed by the pension fund's lawyers to the committee's improper calculation of the restricted stock unit's "fair values" at the time of the grants, and said it misled shareholders who would be casting advisory votes on executive compensation, known as "say-on-pay."<br/>
<br/>
U.S. District Judge Jennifer Rochon disagreed, however,  saying Apple described its pay methods in detailed compensation tables in its 2023 proxy statement "precisely," as securities laws and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require.<br/>
<br/>
The Manhattan judge also found no proof that Apple's board of directors acted improperly in awarding pay, and said the plaintiff did not give the board enough time to consider its objections before suing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple proxy filings show Cook's compensation totaled about &#36;99 million in both 2021 and 2022, including more than &#36;82 million of stock awards each year. Cook's total pay declined to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/tim-cook-compensation-2023/">&#36;63.2 million for 2023</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/apple-defeats-lawsuit-overpaid-tim-cook/">Apple Defeats Lawsuit Claiming It Overpaid Tim Cook and Other Execs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-defeats-lawsuit-claiming-it-overpaid-tim-cook-and-other-execs.2418880/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the Swiss Confederation and Sweden began receiving notifications about cycling directions overnight. &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; provides cycling directions along bike lanes, bike paths, and bike-friendly roads wherever possible, including details like steep inclines, how busy a street is, and whether there are stairs or other obstacles along a route. <br/>
<br/>
If you have an Apple Watch, voice guidance and haptic feedback also make it easier to stay focused on your direction of travel.<br/>
<br/>
Cycling directions came to &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; in iOS 14, and are also available across the United States, China, and Japan, as well as in select major cities around the world, such as London, Barcelona, and Toronto. Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#maps-cycling">maintains a list</a> of all of the areas where cycling directions are available on its website, but as of writing this, it has not yet been updated to include Switzerland and Sweden.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A security researcher who reported bugs to Apple was arrested in January for defrauding the company out of millions of dollars, according to a report from <a href="https://www.404media.co/security-researcher-allegedly-hacked-apples-backend-scammed-2-5-million/"><em>404 Media</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/bug-security-vulnerability-issue-fix-larry.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896108" /><br/>
The researcher, Noah Roskin-Frazee, was accused alongside a co-conspirator obtaining over &#36;3 million in products and services through more than two dozen fraudulent orders. That included around &#36;2.5 million in gift cards and over &#36;100,000 in "products and services."<br/>
<br/>
While Apple is not explicitly named in the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24412154-noah-roskin-frazee?ref=404media.co">court records</a>, an unnamed "Company A" is located in Cupertino, California, and is clearly Apple. The court mentions that one of the perpetrators used gift cards to "purchase Final Cut Pro on Company A's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>," and Apple is the only company that sells the software.<br/>
<br/>
In 2019, Frazee and his accomplice used a password reset tool to gain access to an employee account that belonged to an unnamed "Company B," which does customer support for Apple. That account led to access to additional employee credentials, and Frazee accessed Company B's VPN servers. From there, Frazee was able to get into Apple's systems, placing fraudulent orders for Apple products.<br/>
<br/>
He used Apple's "Toolbox" program that could be used to edit orders after they were placed, and he changed order values to zero, added products to orders, and extended <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> contracts. He abused Apple's program from January to March 2019.<br/>
<blockquote>The defendants remoted into computers located in India and Costa Rica as part of the scheme, the indictment adds. The scam itself involved changing order monetary values to zero, adding products to existing orders without cost such as phones and laptops, and extending existing service contracts, the indictment adds. That included extending a customer service contract that was associated with one of the defendants and his family for an extra two years without paying.</blockquote><br/>
Apple thanked Frazee for in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214036">January support document</a> for finding several bugs in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, and the document was published less than two weeks after he was arrested. "We would like to acknowledge Noah Roskin-Frazee and Prof. J. (ZeroClicks.ai Lab) for their assistance," reads Apple's page in reference to a Wi-Fi vulnerability.<br/>
<br/>
Frazee has been charged with wire fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, and intentional damage to a protected computer. He will be required to forfeit all of the stolen goods, and he could be sentenced to more than 20 years in jail if convicted.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/security-researcher-apple-theft/">Security Researcher Allegedly Exploited Internal Apple Tool to Steal Millions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/security-researcher-allegedly-exploited-internal-apple-tool-to-steal-millions.2418847/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began offering <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">refurbished versions</a> of the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip, offering the machines at a discount for the first time since their October 2023 launch date.<br/>
<br/>

Pricing on the refurbished 14-inch MacBook Pro models starts at &#36;1,359, a &#36;240 discount off of the original &#36;1,599 starting price.<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, Apple appears to be offering only MacBook Pro models with the standard M3 chip, with no M3 Pro or M3 Max machines available for purchase. Apple has several configurations listed with additional storage space.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the entry-level models have already sold out, and availability will fluctuate as Apple restocks the refurbished store. Customers looking for a specific configuration should check back often.<br/>
<br/>
All of Apple's refurbished Macs are close to identical to new products. They are subject to a refurbishment process that includes full functionality testing, with any defective modules replaced, as well as a thorough cleaning and inspection. Refurbished products are eligible for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ and have the same 14-day return period as new Apple devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro/">Apple Now Selling Refurbished 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro.2418844/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new iOS 17.4 update that brings some major changes to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> (and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>) in Europe. Some of the biggest updates are only going to update people in the European Union, but there are also plenty of features in iOS 17.4 that are available worldwide. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In this article, we've rounded up everything new so far in iOS 17.4. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="eu_changes">EU Changes</h2><br/>
Apple implemented notable changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act. These changes are included in iOS 17.4, but are limited to countries that are in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833990" /><br/>
<h3 id="alternative_app_stores_and_new_app_store_terms">Alternative App Stores and New App Store Terms</h3><br/>
App developers in the EU can opt to offer alternative app stores or install their apps through alternative stores, and Apple has a whole new fee structure that goes along with this change. There's a new business structure that developers can opt in to, which applies to both apps distributed in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and apps that are distributed through alternative means.<br/>
<br/>
App developers using the new system will need to pay a standard fee of 0.50 euros per user per year, with the first million installs offered for free. Apps distributed through alternative app stores will have no commission. Apps distributed through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will pay a reduced 17 percent commission, or 10 percent for those in the small business program or for user subscriptions older than a year.<br/>
<br/>
Developers can choose not to opt in to the new system and can use the existing system with the same 15/30 percent commission that's available elsewhere in the world. Apple has a fee calculator to help developers determine what they'll pay with the existing setup, with the new setup, with the new setup using alternative app stores, and with the new setup using the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Users are able to set their preferred alternative app store as the default app store on their device if desired. EU users will see an option for this in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
There are a huge number of behind-the-scene changes that are enabling this feature in the EU, with updates to all kinds of system messaging. Users in the EU will, for example, get a pop up warning when an app from an alternative app store contains malware, and there are new screens for verifying the information from an alternative app.<br/>
<br/>
A Screen Time setting will allow parents to decide whether their children's devices are able to install apps from alternative app marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="alternative_payment_options">Alternative Payment Options</h2><br/>
Apple is also allowing apps to use alternative payment options in their apps, and there is no longer a requirement to use in-app purchase. Developers who distribute apps through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and use an alternative payment option will see a three percent discount in their &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fees.<br/>
<br/>
Developers who distribute through alternative apps and also use an alternative payment option will pay Apple no fees beyond the set 0.50 euro fee per user.<br/>
<br/>
With alternative payments, purchases for digital goods and services can be made directly in an app or a developer can choose to link to their website to have a user make a payment. Apple is requiring developers to use a known, secure payment provider.<br/>

<h3 id="third-party_browser_updates">Third-Party Browser Updates</h3><br/>
After updating to iOS 17.4, EU users that open Safari will see a pop up that allows them to choose a new default browser option from a list of the most popular browsers on iOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also allowing alternative browser engines, and will not limit browsers like Chrome to the WebKit engine.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="nfc_access">NFC Access</h3><br/>
Third-party payment apps and banks have access to the NFC chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in iOS 17.4, and can offer contactless payments directly on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or the Wallet app in the European Economic Area. Users can set a default contactless payment provider that activates at tap-to-pay terminals or when the Side button on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is pressed twice.<br/>
<br/>
The option for setting a default contactless payment provider is available in the Settings app in the EU, and this section will also provide details on all apps that have requested and been granted contactless payment access.<br/>
<br/>
EU users can also change the default Wallet app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="gaming_app_changes">Gaming App Changes</h2><br/>
Streaming game apps are now allowed on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; worldwide, which means services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW can be offered as standalone &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously only allowed cloud gaming services to be offered via the web, but dedicated apps that let users stream games from servers are now permitted.<br/>
<br/>
Mini-app, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins are also now able to use the in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_emoji">New Emoji</h2><br/>
The iOS 17.4 beta adds new emoji characters that include lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).<br/>
<br/>

These emoji are part of the Unicode 15.1 update that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ios-17-future-emoji/">approved in September 2023</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messaging_with_siri">Messaging with Siri</h2><br/>
The Automatically Send Messages setting under <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> & Search has been renamed "Messaging with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;," and there is an option to set &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to read incoming messages in a specific language like Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and many more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-messaging-with-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932819" /><br/>
The change does not update the primary language that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; listens in and responds to, but is limited to message playback.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="podcasts_and_music">Podcasts and Music</h2><br/>
The "Listen Now" tabs in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and Podcasts have been renamed to "Home."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-music-home.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932818" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="podcast_transcripts">Podcast Transcripts</h2><br/>
The Podcasts app now offers transcripts, similar to how lyrics work in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/podcast-app-transcript.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932875" /><br/>
Podcasts also uses the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Now Playing bar when collapsed. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2><br/>
The URL/search bar in Safari is now wider than it was before.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-wider-safari-url-bar.jpg" alt="" width="2807" height="1579" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932817" /><br/>
<h2 id="stolen_device_protection">Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
In the Stolen Device Protection section of the Settings app, there is now an option to require a security delay always or only when away from familiar locations. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932874" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="next-generation_carplay_support">Next-Generation CarPlay Support</h2><br/>
Next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> is set to launch in the U.S. later in 2024, and code in iOS 17.4 references eight new &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; apps. <br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Car Camera:</strong> This app will display the vehicle's rear-view camera feed.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> For electric vehicles, this app will display battery level, charging status, time remaining until the battery is fully charged, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Climate:</strong> This app will provide access to a vehicle's climate controls within &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heating system, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Closures:</strong> This app will display if any of the vehicle's doors are opened, and it might also display vehicle warning symbols.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> This app will provide access to FM and AM radio station controls within &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, along with other media options like SiriusXM. It is unclear if SiriusXM will offer satellite connectivity, or remain limited to internet streaming. Users will be able to select from a list of music genres, such as Top 40 and Rock.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Tire Pressure:</strong> This app will display air pressure for each of the vehicle's tires, and provide low pressure, high pressure, and flat tire warnings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Trips:</strong> This app will provide a variety of driving-related data, including the vehicle's average speed, fuel efficiency or energy efficiency, the total time elapsed and distance traveled on a trip, and more.</li></ul>An image in iOS 17.4 beta suggests that &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will also likely display a "Goodbye" screen after the driver shuts off the vehicle.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="shareplay">SharePlay</h2><br/>
SharePlay music control <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/">is expanding</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> with iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4. With the feature, a user's family and friends can control the music that is playing on a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, so long as the user has granted permission.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933114" /><br/>
The person who owns the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; needs to have an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription, but the person who is granted SharePlay access can play music using &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; without a subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Connecting to a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; to use SharePlay can be done by scanning a QR code on the device owner's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (for &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;) or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. Users can connect to a device while in the same space or remotely.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="stopwatch_live_activity">Stopwatch Live Activity</h2><br/>
iOS 17.4 adds a Live Activity function for the Stopwatch feature on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. When activated through the Clock app, the Stopwatch now shows up in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and on the Lock Screen. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stopwatch.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933379" /><br/>
There are controls for pausing the Stopwatch, clearing it, and starting a new lap. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_tv_app">Apple TV App</h2><br/>
The "How to Watch" section in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app that shows where a movie or TV show can be viewed now has a list interface rather than a card interface. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-how-to-watch.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933405" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="app_store">App Store</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;'s Purchase feature now shows account-wide purchase history for an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>. It includes TV and movie purchases, music purchases, subscriptions, and app purchases, and it is the same interface that is available when accessing the purchase information for any &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/app-store-purchase-history-ios-17-4.jpg" alt="" width="5289" height="2975" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933406" /><br/>
Apps are still listed, but under a new "Apps" section.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="clock_widget">Clock Widget</h2><br/>
There's a new City Digital Clock widget that can be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ios-17-4-city-digital.jpg" alt="" width="5344" height="3006" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935544" /><br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
Apple will release iOS 17.4 in March, likely during the first week of the month. <br/>
