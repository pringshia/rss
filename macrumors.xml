		<description><![CDATA[Verizon today has a few rare Apple deals, including record low prices on the <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-tv-4k-wifi-with-64-gb-storage%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku5710030">64GB Apple TV 4K</a> and <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-homepod%2F">second generation HomePod</a>. These deals are available to all shoppers and you don't need to be a Verizon customer to get the discounts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Apple-TV-Deals-22-Feature-Multi0011.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850916" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Verizon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the 64GB Apple TV 4K for <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-tv-4k-wifi-with-64-gb-storage%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku5710030"><strong>&#36;89.99</strong></a> in this sale, down from &#36;129.99, which is a new all-time low price. We haven't tracked any notable deals on the 2022 A15 Apple TV 4K in nearly a year, much less one as low as Verizon's sale.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-tv-4k-wifi-with-64-gb-storage%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku5710030"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;40 OFF</div>Apple TV 4K (64GB) for &#36;89.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Secondly, Verizon has the second generation HomePod for <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-homepod%2F"><strong>&#36;174.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;299.99. This is a massive &#36;125 discount on the 2023 smart speaker, beating the traditional discounted price by nearly &#36;100. This one is only available in Midnight.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/new-homepod-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953293" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-homepod%2F"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;125 OFF</div>HomePod (2nd Gen) for &#36;174.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Lastly, the carrier has a few buy one, get one half off deals going on right now on both <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-11557999?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fonesearch%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dairpods%26ES%3Dshop%26src%3Dwireless">AirPods</a> and <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-homepod-mini%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku4240002">HomePod mini</a>. AirPods under this deal include AirPods Pro 2, AirPods 3, and AirPods 2. All colors of the HomePod mini are available for the BOGO deal, and would effectively make each speaker about &#36;75.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a new version of iPadOS 17.5.1, specifically for the 10th-generation low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. The update is a second version of iPadOS 17.5.1, with a version number of 21F91, up from the original 21F90 version.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951676" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-17.5.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The iPadOS 17.5.1 update can be downloaded through Finder or iTunes, and it does not appear to be over-the-air as of yet. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 10 owners who already installed iPadOS 17.5.1 may not see the update, and it may be limited to those who have not yet downloaded the software.<br/>
<br/>
There is no word on why Apple has released a new version of iPadOS 17.5.1 for the 10th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5.1 and iPadOS 17.5.1 previously came out on Monday, May 20, and included a fix for a bug that could cause images to reappear in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app even after being deleted. Apple said the bug was caused by a database corruption issue.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-releases-ipados-17-5-1-ipad-10/">Apple Releases Revised iPadOS 17.5.1 Update for iPad 10</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-revised-ipados-17-5-1-update-for-ipad-10.2428059/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated its Apple Developer app in preparation for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a>, which is set to begin next Monday with a keynote event at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-795934" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-developer-app-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" /><br/>
The updated version of the Developer app will host 2024 session videos, 1-on-1 labs with Apple engineers and designers, and more. Apple plans to stream the WWDC keynote event in the Apple Developer app, as well as the Platforms State of the Union and other developer sessions that are set to come out throughout the week.<br/>
<br/>
With the refreshed Developer app, Apple has added related videos and an option to quickly view full-screen videos on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> when it's held in landscape mode, along with bug fixes. Apple's release notes:<blockquote>New in this release:<br/>
- Explore all WWDC24 has to offer, including video sessions, consultations, and more.<br/>
- When a video ends, you'll see a related video to play next.<br/>
- When viewing a video in landscape orientation on iPhone, you can tap its thumbnail to present it full-screen.<br/>
- We've fixed bugs and added various other enhancements.</blockquote>With every pre-WWDC update, Apple introduces new stickers, and this year there are nine sticker options that have been included. The stickers, many of which are animated, can be used in iMessage, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and other apps. Stickers include animated emoji characters, an Apple logo, a Vision Pro, and static dogcow and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/wwdec24-stickers.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953281" /><br/>
&zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; will focus on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a>, and more, with no hardware expected this year.<br/>
<br/>
Developers can use the WWDC app to access all of what Apple has to offer. Since 2020, the bulk of the WWDC event has been online, with all developers able to view sessions and engage with Apple employees. A select number of developers have also been invited to &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; for a viewing event.<br/>
<br/>
It is available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac.

<br/>
Apple partners with several retailers to offer three percent Daily Cash back on ‌‌&zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;‌‌ purchases made with ‌‌&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;‌‌, including Ace Hardware. Three percent cash back can also be earned from Panera Bread, T-Mobile, Nike, Uber Eats, Uber, Panera, Walgreens, Exxon Mobil, and Apple's own retail stores.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a trio of humorous Mac ads that focus on the battery life, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and the performance capabilities of Apple silicon notebooks. The "Charged" ad, for example, shows a serious professor commenting on a student's remaining battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Mac Charged Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZpLYP-JHg9A" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
"First class of the day and no charger? You're playing a dangerous game..." he says, but the student says that she doesn't have to worry about it because the Mac's battery lasts all day.<br/>
<br/>
In "Powered," a student in a library is approached by a woman who says that laptops aren't meant to handle big files and multiple apps. "You think it won't crash?" she says. "You're a hot dog in a hurricane." The student lets her know that "it's a Mac," so it's "running fine."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Mac Powered Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb4jrtDzFhE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The "Found" ad features a student looking for her laptop. "Yeah, computers have a funny way of vanishing around here..." says a man nearby. The student uses &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; to ping her laptop and is able to locate it while he's still going on about how computers are often sold for parts. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UeE4l2MlWMo" title="Mac | Found | Apple" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
All three videos have a dramatic, funny vibe that should play well on social networks. The ads are 38 seconds long, so they'll likely be shown on TikTok, Instagram, and other social networks.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/mac-ads-apple-silicon-battery-life/">Humorous Apple Ads Highlight MacBook&#039;s Power and Battery Life</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/humorous-apple-ads-highlight-macbooks-power-and-battery-life.2428045/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is unlikely to release a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> before 2027, but it could significantly disrupt the market when it launches, according to Taiwanese research firm <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240603-12170.html">TrendForce</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="820" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-797652" /><br/>
The report highlights that foldable phones currently represent a mere 1.5% of the smartphone market, with projections suggesting an increase to 4.8% by 2028. Apple is apparently "still evaluating component specifications and performance, with strict requirements for crease and reliability." Screen creasing is an issue that plagues many current foldable devices, raising concerns about long-term durability and the risk of screen damage from debris. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the emergence of a range of popular foldable devices from the likes of Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, and Nubia, Apple's delayed entry to the foldable space is not necessarily a disadvantage. The company's significant market influence and established customer base mean that a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; could quickly gain popularity upon release. As a result, analysts believe that Apple's entry into the foldable phone space could "significantly shift market dynamics."<br/>

<br/>

In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0">latest edition of his <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> on Sunday, Gurman said Control Center will feature an upgraded music widget and improved controls for HomeKit smart home accessories. However, he did not provide any further details about these changes, so all we know for now is these will apparently be two focus areas for Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will unveil iOS 18 during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and the first beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the presentation.

		<title>Apple Vision Pro Mindfulness App May Get &#039;Respiration Tracking&#039; Feature</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new "respiration tracking" feature for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> that is likely to be functional during mindfulness sessions, based on backend code discovered by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/mindfulness-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953177" /><br/>
Contributor Aaron Perris found references to the previously unheard-of feature in lines of code related to the headset's Mindfulness app, which offers users an immersive meditation experience using either guided meditations or self-guided sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Mindfulness app essentially encourages the user to cultivate awareness of their own breath to support mental wellbeing. Attention to breathing is generally considered to be a foundational component of mindfulness practice, and long-term mindfulness training is associated with reliable differences in resting respiration rate, according to empirical research. <br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch can already track respiration rate while wearers are sleeping. Apple Watch uses its built-in accelerometer, which measures vibration and movement, to determine how many times a person breathes each minute. While the Vision Pro also has an accelerometer, it's unclear whether this hardware or sensors that track changes in facial musculature would be involved when a mindfulness session is in progress. <br/>
<br/>
There's no information suggesting if or when the feature could make an appearance, but Apple is expected to announce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2 at its annual developers conference, WWDC, which begins next week, June 10.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-vision-pro-mindfulness-respiration/">Apple Vision Pro Mindfulness App May Get &#039;Respiration Tracking&#039; Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-mindfulness-app-may-get-respiration-tracking-feature.2428034/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Fitness-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0CSVB8BP1%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1">large collection of Apple Watch Series 9 models</a> on sale at all-time low prices, including both GPS and cellular devices. It's been a few weeks since we last tracked any notable markdowns on the Series 9, so if you've been waiting for a deal now is definitely the time to buy the wearable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/series-9-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926442" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get up to &#36;100 off most Apple Watch Series 9 models right now on Amazon, starting at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Fitness-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0CSVB8BP1%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;299.00</strong></a> for the 41mm GPS watches. We've rounded up all of the deals in lists below, focusing on the aluminum devices, but you can also find &#36;100 discounts on a few stainless steel models as well.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F2053BA59-F374-47FC-9333-5BF1839E8DEB%3Fingress%3D2%26visitId%3D41892507-7fff-44b6-896a-be2f1740c26f%26ref_%3Dast_bln"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 Discounts at Amazon</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
All of the Apple Watch Series 9 devices in this sale lack the Blood Oxygen feature that were available on models prior to the sales ban that began in the United States back in January. The sales ban covers any Apple Watch model with blood oxygen sensing, and since it began most retailers continued to sell through their stock of devices that still supported the feature.<br/>
<br/>
Now that it's been a few months, retailers like Amazon are starting to see their stock dwindle on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models with blood oxygen support. Other than this, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the exact same as it was when it launched, the new models just have blood oxygen disabled.<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953125" /><br/>
iOS 18 is set to be unveiled during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and the first beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately after the presentation. The first public beta of iOS 18 will likely follow in July, and the update should be widely released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap what to expect from the Messages app on iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support</h2><br/>
Last year, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS (Rich Communication Services)</a> in the Messages app starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
These features are already available for iMessage conversations with blue bubbles, and RCS will extend the capabilities to green bubbles over both Wi-Fi and cellular networks. It is expected that SMS will remain available as a fallback option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Per-Word Effects</h2><br/>
Apple plans to add a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-imessage-text-effects/">per-word text effects option</a> to the Messages app on iOS 18, multiple sources familiar with the matter told <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
While it is already possible to send iMessages with entire-bubble or full-screen effects, such as invisible ink or confetti, the text effects would allow you to animate individual words within a message. Our hope is that Apple will also add bold, italics, and underline formatting options, but we have not confirmed that possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Suggested Replies</h2><br/>
iOS 18 will add AI-generated suggested replies to the Messages app, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/more-details-about-ios-18s-ai-features-revealed/"><em>AppleInsider</em></a>. This feature would analyze recent messages in a conversation and provide a few suggested replies that users could tap on to send.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Custom Emoji</h2><br/>
Another rumored AI-powered feature is the option to send <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">custom emoji that are automatically generated</a> based on the context of recent messages.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Message Recaps</h2><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to provide <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">AI-generated recaps of information</a> from several apps, including recent messages received in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Tapback Icons</h2><br/>
Tapback icons (the heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, "haha," exclamation marks, and question mark that can be added to messages) may be redesigned on iOS 18, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/ios-18-rumored-features-for-messages-app/">iOS 18 Rumored to Add These 6 New Features to iPhone&#039;s Messages App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumored-to-add-these-6-new-features-to-iphones-messages-app.2428029/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has seemingly updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/specs/">tech specs webpage</a> for the latest M2 iPad Air models to indicate the M2 chip has a 9-core GPU, rather than 10 cores as previously stated.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M2-iPad-Air-Hero-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949534" /><br/>
The change was first reported by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/01/m2-ipad-air-gpu-core-count/">9to5Mac</a></em>. Based on available web snapshots, the update to Apple's US website was made within the last 10 days. However, the equivalent webpage on many of Apple's regional stores still lists the M2 iPad Air as having a 10-core GPU. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-the-redesigned-11-inch-and-all-new-13-inch-ipad-air-with-m2/">press release</a> originally announcing the product on its Newsroom also mirrors the original 10-core spec, as does <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/119894">support documentation</a> for the device.  <br/>
<br/>
Apple has not commented on the change, which, if accurate, makes the new iPad Air the first M2-based Apple device with a 9-core GPU. Since the change went live on Apple's site, the going theory is that Apple's processor yield of 10-core chips was not sufficient, so it is using a "binned" version of the 10-core chip with one of the GPU cores disabled. The practice of "binning" is sometimes used to optimize processor yields and reduce waste. <br/>
<br/>
In all likelihood, every M2 iPad Air model that Apple has sold includes a 9-core GPU, and Apple is simply updating its product information for accuracy. Any real-world performance difference between an M2 iPad Air with a 9-core versus a 10-core GPU would have arguably been unnoticeable to most users. Even so, some customers will probably want to know why Apple's marketing materials were mistaken.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-says-m2-ipad-air-9-gpu-cores-not-10/">Apple Says M2 iPad Air Has 9 GPU Cores, Not 10 as Originally Stated</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-m2-ipad-air-has-9-gpu-cores-not-10-as-originally-stated.2428016/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Justin Long, the face of Apple's iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eEG5LVXdKo">"I'm a Mac" commercials</a>, now stars in a short Qualcomm skit promoting Snapdragon-powered PCs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5R3QpKMciEw?si=gr4XADXs59lte8Ku&amp;start=4626" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
At the Computex 2024 keynote, Qualcomm unveiled the new skit featuring Long, who is well-known for his role in Apple's "Get a Mac" commercials nearly two decades ago. Long is depicted as being overwhelmed by a barrage of notifications about app compatibility, low disk space, and battery issues in macOS, prompting him to search for an alternative in the form of a Windows on ARM PC. The ad concludes with Long stating, "Things change," a sentiment echoed by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon during the event's closing remarks. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips debut in new Copilot Plus PCs on June 18.<br/>
<br/>
Long's participation in the skit is the latest development in a series of marketing strategies where tech companies use his association with the "I'm a Mac" persona to promote their products. The trend began in 2017 when Huawei featured Long in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/31/justin-long-joins-huawei-ad-campaign/">ad for its Mate 9 smartphone</a>. In 2021, Intel also employed Long to create commercials that praised PCs and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/justin-long-get-a-mac-intel-ad-campaign/">mocked various aspects of Apple's M1 MacBooks</a>, including the Touch Bar and its limited color options.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the original "Get a Mac" ad campaign in 2006. Long played a personified Mac, characterized as easygoing and efficient, while John Hodgman portrayed a PC, depicted as conformist and prone to problems like viruses and system crashes. The ads ran for three years and consisted of 66 different commercials, although Long revealed in 2019 that approximately 300 were filmed.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/im-a-mac-snapdragon-pc-skit/">Qualcomm Enlists &#039;I&#039;m a Mac&#039; Ad Star for Snapdragon PC Skit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/qualcomm-enlists-im-a-mac-ad-star-for-snapdragon-pc-skit.2428015/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sonos in May decided to get into the headphone market with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/hands-on-sonos-ace-headphones/">launch of the Sonos Ace headphones</a>. The <a href="https://howl.me/cmn5Z7bb51W">&#36;449 Sonos Ace headphones</a> have some enticing design elements and features you won't see in Apple's headphones, so we thought we'd compare them to the &#36;549 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> to see which is ultimately better.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="13" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xzG_OcEjNw8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
In terms of design, both the Sonos Ace and &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are over-ear headphones that have a premium look, but the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; have a fancier feel because of the aluminum material. While Apple opted for brushed aluminum ear cups in a range of colors, Sonos went for recycled plastic in either black or white.<br/>
<br/>
Both have a minimal aesthetic, but the lack of aluminum makes the Sonos Ace lighter and more comfortable to wear. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are 13.6 ounces, and the Sonos Ace weigh 11 ounces. Two ounces might not sound like a lot, but it impacts comfort. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; also tend to clamp tightly to the head, which the Sonos Ace don't do, so it's just easier overall to wear the Sonos Ace with the gentler fit.<br/>
<br/>
The ear cups on the Sonos Ace are made from memory foam covered with vegan leather, and Apple's ear cups are made from a mesh acoustic fabric that's supposed to better conduct sound than other materials. The soft Sonos Ace ear cups will probably be more comfortable for most people, but there might be less breathability just because of the nature of the fabric. Apple created a u-shaped mesh headband with telescoping arms, while the Sonos Ace uses the same vegan leather material also with telescoping arms.<br/>
<br/>
You can't fold the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, and you also can't fold the Sonos Ace, but Sonos made a better case. It's slim, light, and offers full protection, unlike the unpopular case Apple offers with the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Sound quality is similar, but the Sonos app has an adjustable EQ for tweaking sound to your liking, which is something that can't be done on the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;. Both support spatial audio and Dolby Atmos, and Sonos' spatial audio is just as impressive as Apple's. The Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency options perform close to the same, and while Apple has the best Transparency mode, Sonos is right behind.<br/>
<br/>
You can pair the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; and the Sonos Ace to a TV set, but for the AirPods you'll need a &#36;129 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and for the Sonos Ace, you'll need the Arc Soundbar, which is &#36;719. Sonos plans to add Ace integration to its other soundbars, but none are cheap.<br/>
<br/>
Both pair to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac with no additional hardware, but you get better connectivity with the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; thanks to fast switching and one tap pairing. It's more of a hassle to pair the Sonos Ace because it uses standard Bluetooth with no automatic pairing via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, so when you're changing devices, you'll need to manually reconnect.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos' headphones are several years newer than the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; at this point, and battery technology has improved. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; only offer 20 hours of battery life with ANC and spatial audio turned on, while the Sonos Ace offer 30 hours of battery. Apple also hasn't updated the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; with USB-C, so they're still using the Lightning port that's being phased out. Unless you want to have to use a Lightning port for several more years, it's best to go with the Ace, another set of headphones, or wait for the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; USB-C refresh that's supposed to be coming later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos priced the Ace &#36;100 cheaper than the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, but it's pretty easy to find the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; at a discount these days. If you can live without quick pairing, automatic switching, and the Apple aesthetic, the Sonos Ace offer the same sound quality and ANC, plus they're more comfortable.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models will have the thinnest bezels of any smartphone, beating the screen border thinness of even its latest iPhone 15 Pro devices. That's according to the leaker known as "Ice Universe," who has divulged accurate information about Apple's plans in the past.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928695" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/">multiple sources</a>, despite minimal design changes, both iPhone 16 Pro models will increase in size this year. The iPhone 16 Pro is said to be 6.3 inches (up from 6.1), while the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to measure in at 6.9 inches (up from 6.7), potentially making it Apple's biggest iPhone ever. <br/>
<br/>
But it seems that Apple isn't just relying on larger physical dimensions to make the viewing experience more immersive. <a href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1797408311513600503">According to Ice Universe</a>, this year's Pro models will also have reduced bezels that could be the thinnest yet seen on any smartphone, including those on the Samsung Galaxy S24. <br/>
<br/>
The breakthrough for achieving this could be Apple's rumored use of Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology, which allows for a more compact and efficient layout of the circuitry under the display, resulting in even slimmer bezels. Ice Universe did not mention BRS, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/">two</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/">rumors</a> out of Asia have referenced the technology in relation to iPhone 16 models.<br/>

Last year, Apple reduced the bezels on iPhone 15 Pro models using low-injection pressure over-molding, or LIPO, to shrink the display border size to 1.5 millimeters (versus around 2.2 millimeters on iPhone 14 models). Besides that, Apple has not significantly tweaked iPhone screen sizes since the introduction of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12 models in 2020. But as mentioned, things are set to change with the Pro models in the 2024 iPhone 16 lineup. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/universeice/">UniverseIce</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/iphone-16-pro-thinnest-bezels-smartphone/">iPhone 16 Pro Could Break Record for Thinnest Bezels on a Smartphone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-could-break-record-for-thinnest-bezels-on-a-smartphone.2428008/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0">does not expect</a> Apple to announce any new hardware during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC 2024 keynote on June 10</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" /><br/>
"There's no hardware slated to be announced at WWDC, unless Apple unexpectedly previews a new device launching later (to be clear: I don't expect that)," said Gurman, in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, Gurman now says a new Apple TV model "isn't imminent," despite previously reporting that Apple was aiming to release a new Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">in the first half of 2024</a>. The current Apple TV was introduced in October 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Here is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li><br/>
<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li><br/>
<li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV:</strong> March 2012</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The next Apple TV is rumored to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">could have a &#36;99 starting price</a> in the U.S., down from &#36;129 currently.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls on the TV, but this currently requires using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/02/gurman-no-new-hardware-at-wwdc-2024/">Gurman: No Hardware at WWDC, Next Apple TV No Longer Coming Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-hardware-at-wwdc-next-apple-tv-no-longer-coming-soon.2427954/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy has a huge collection of discounts on Apple's MacBook Air this weekend, including both the previous generation M2 models from 2022 and the brand new M3 computers that launched this year. In regards to the M2 models, you'll find the best deals at Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M2 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Amazon today has every model of the 2022 13-inch MacBook Air available for &#36;170 off, representing new all-time low prices on the notebooks. These prices are available to all shoppers and do not require a coupon code.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/macbook-air-bb-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946063" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The 256GB model is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;829.00</strong></a> and the 512GB model is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3CGXWN4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,029.00</strong></a>. These deals beat the previous prices we tracked earlier in the year by about &#36;50.<br/>

<br/>
You can get both models in all four colors: Starlight, Space Gray, Silver, and Midnight. Following the introduction of the M3 MacBook Air, Apple knocked the price of the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air down by &#36;100, and it's still selling them alongside the M3 model.<br/>
<h2>M3 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
You can find all-time low prices across the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air lineup at Best Buy, including up to &#36;100 off these 2024 computers.

<br/>
<h2>Apple Now Selling Refurbished iPhone 14 Models</h2><br/>
Apple this week began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/apple-now-selling-refurbished-iphone-14-models/">selling refurbished iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max models</a> in the U.S. and some other countries for the first time since the devices were released in September 2022. The models quickly sold out, but inventory should be replenished over time.<br/>
<br/>

Apple's refurbished iPhones come with a new battery, outer shell, and box, along with a charging cable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>These 10 New AI Features Are Reportedly Coming in iOS 18</h2><br/>
iOS 18 is widely rumored to add a wide range of new AI features to the iPhone, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">new report has provided more details about what to expect</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Apple-Music-Messages-and-Notes-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948782" /><br/>
The new features will allegedly include AI-powered photo retouching, voice memo transcription, suggested replies to emails and messages, auto-generated custom emojis based on the content of a user's messages, improved Safari web search, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
On <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/the-macrumors-show-new-ios-18-rumors/">this week's episode of The MacRumors Show</a>, Dan and Hartley discuss a wide array of rumors about iOS 18 across Apple's built-in apps and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What to Expect From CarPlay on iOS 18</h2><br/>
iOS 18 will include some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/what-to-expect-from-carplay-on-ios-18/">new features for Apple's in-vehicle software system CarPlay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-CarPlay-Dash.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934995" /><br/>
In a press release earlier this month, Apple highlighted three new accessibility features coming to CarPlay as part of the update, including Sound Recognition, Voice Control, and Color Filters. In addition, Apple's website says the first vehicles with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/apple-next-generation-carplay-recap/">next-generation CarPlay</a> will arrive in 2024, so that rollout could coincide with iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Beats Solo Buds Available to Order June 18, Launch June 20</h2><br/>
Beats Solo Buds were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">first announced in April</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/beats-solo-buds-launch-date/">now Apple has shared availability details</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-red-pairing.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948608" /><br/>
Apple says the Solo Buds will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/beats-solo-buds-launch-date/">available to order on June 18, and launch on June 20</a>. Priced at &#36;79.99, the wireless earbuds feature up to 18 hours of battery life, a USB-C carrying case, and Find My support on iOS and Android. However, they lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Beats Pill Speaker Listed on Apple's Regulatory Website</h2><br/>
After appearing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/">alongside famous athletes</a>, in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-beats-pill-ios-17-5/">iOS 17.5 code</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/beats-pill-fcc-database/">in the FCC database</a>, a new Beats Pill speaker has now been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/new-beats-pill-speaker-on-apple-regulatory-website/">listed on Apple's regulatory compliance website</a> for Europe.<br/>
<br/>

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/beats-pill-discontinued/">discontinued the previous Beats Pill+ speaker</a> in 2022. The new version is likely to feature a USB-C charging port, support for a newer Bluetooth version, a built-in lanyard option, longer battery life, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While Apple refreshed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> in May, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> is still in need of an update. Apple last introduced a new &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; in September 2021, so it's overdue for an overhaul.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ipad-mini-blue-2.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937844" /><br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple has plans to refresh its smallest tablet in 2024, and this guide highlights all of the rumors we've heard about the device so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="display_and_design">Display and Design</h2><br/>
We haven't heard rumors of design changes for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, which means it will likely feature the same 8.3-inch size and all-display design. The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> Power Button, which we're also expecting for the new model.<br/>
<br/>
According to a 2023 rumor, Apple will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">make a small tweak</a> to the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s display in an effort to cut down on "jelly scrolling." The screen assembly will be rotated, which is supposed to reduce the effect when using the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; in portrait orientation.<br/>
<br/>
Jelly scrolling refers to noticeable lag when scrolling vertically through text-based context like a webpage. Each line appears to tilt downward toward the left of the screen as it passes, which makes it look like one side of the display is responding faster. Apple says that this is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/28/apple-jelly-scrolling-normal-behavior/">normal behavior</a> for LCD iPads, but the company still wants to make a change to minimize the effect.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="a-series_chip">A-Series Chip</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; have M-series chips, but we're not expecting the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; to get a Mac chip this year. Instead, Apple is likely to go with the A17 Pro that was used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, or some other A17 variant.<br/>
<br/>
It's also possible that the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will get an A18 chip if it comes after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, as rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will have chips in the A18 family.<br/>
<br/>
With an A17 Pro or better, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; would be on par with or faster than the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, but it won't have the speeds of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is overhauling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and iPadOS 18 with a focus on AI, so high powered chips are a must for upcoming devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_colors">New Colors</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is available in space gray, starlight, pink, and purple right now. Apple often refreshes color options with updates, so new colors are a definite possibility. With the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, which the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; often mimics, Apple got rid of pink.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple makes the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; available in the same colors as the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, it could come in space gray, purple, blue, and starlight.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="front_camera">Front Camera</h2><br/>
Apple moved the front-facing camera on the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to the landscape edge of the device, and it could make the same change for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;. It may make less sense to have a landscape camera on an &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, though, because it's less often used with keyboards.<br/>
<br/>
The camera could get support for HDR 4 and it could have a wider aperture, if it adopts the camera used in the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2><br/>
Apple has been adding Wi-Fi 6E to each product as it's updated, and it should be the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s turn this year. Wi-Fi 6E will allow the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; to connect to the 6GHz Wi-Fi network on supported routers.<br/>
<br/>
Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected, as that's another update Apple has been making to new devices, and the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; could lose its nano-SIM slot, with Apple opting only for eSIM.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_pencil_pro">Apple Pencil Pro</h2><br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> 2, so the new model will likely support the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro. The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro has a squeeze gesture, haptic feedback, a gyroscope for barrel roll support, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> integration.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover might also be a new feature, as the current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; does not support it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
Apple will likely release a new &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; toward the end of the year, likely in September or October. In some years, Apple holds a special October event for Macs and iPads, and we could get that in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
MacBook Pro models, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, and the low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> could all be refreshed alongside the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="future_ipad_mini_models">Future iPad mini Models</h2><br/>
There are rumors that Apple is working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/">foldable iPad mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/apple-planning-to-bring-oled-to-ipad-mini-and-air/">OLED display technology</a> for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, but neither of these updates are expected in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
OLED, a foldable &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, or a foldable OLED &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; are technologies not expected until 2026, 2027, or even later.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/">What to Expect From Apple&#039;s 2024 iPad Mini 7</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-2024-ipad-mini-7.2427857/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
