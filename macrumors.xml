		<description><![CDATA[A recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDI-WYr5aOM">video</a> uploaded to the Apple Support channel on YouTube offers five helpful tips and tricks for AirPods that you may not have known about.<br/>
<br/>

AirPods features highlighted in the video include <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102526">Audio Sharing</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102479">Live Listen</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/airpods/deva1bf8faad/1.0/web/1.0">Background Sounds</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102536">Announce Notifications with Siri</a>, and the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/airpods/deva392f031a/web">ability to rename AirPods</a> in the Settings app on the iPhone. Most of these functions are available on all AirPods models, but Announce Notifications with Siri does not work with first-generation AirPods.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Matthew Cassinelli, one of the minds behind Workflow, joins us on this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apples-ai-powered-shortcuts-for-ios-18/id1602394741?i=1000652267451">The MacRumors Show</a> to talk Apple Shortcuts and potential improvements and AI features coming to the app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edlNruuPMCA?si=qVtbgoKh9mmxWzEH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div> <br/>
Workflow was a unique iOS app that allowed users to create macros for executing specific sequential tasks on their device. In 2017, Apple acquired Workflow and, the following year, it was rebranded as "Shortcuts." Shortcuts have since become a key part of Apple's ecosystem and can be used for a huge range of powerful, automated actions. Matthew was present at Workflow throughout its transition to Apple and now offers his own library of complex Shortcuts, which you can <a href="https://matthewcassinelli.com">access over on his website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">report from <em>The Information</em></a> claimed that &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will introduce some major AI features to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and the Shortcuts app. Apple apparently wants ‌&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌ to be able to help users automate complex, multi-step tasks with voice-based commands and have much deeper integration with Shortcuts, such as by potentially helping users build them.<br/>
<br/>
We break down Apple Shortcuts for beginners and look at some of the many use-cases for the app, as well as consider where it could go next with AI. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> is now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips going forward:<br/>

With the newest version, this support has been expanded so that users can edit imported text as regular text layers. In practice, this means existing text in PDFs can be more easily replaced, formatted, and styled using Pixelmator Pro tools. As the developers explain:<br/>
<blockquote>Typically, text in PDF documents is not directly editable. Instead, it's stored as vector shapes to keep documents looking consistent across various platforms and apps. To make text editable again, Pixelmator Pro extracts various embedded data from the original PDF, allowing it to recover the original text, fonts, and formatting. Even if some of these elements are missing, for instance, if the original font is not installed on your Mac, you can still import the text, select a different font, and continue with your edits.</blockquote>In addition, the new text editing abilities mean users can seamlessly export Apple Keynote and Pages projects and continue editing them in Pixelmator Pro. All text remains fully editable in its original fonts, including the SF Pro font that is used throughout the Apple ecosystem.  <br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in this update, the Style tool has been improved to simplify the creation of custom outlines around text layers. Users now have the option to add strokes inside, within, or outside of the text, choose from various stroke ends and corners, and also add dashed strokes.<br/>
<br/>
Pixelmator Pro 3.5.8 also includes 12 new templates for web, social media, and more. All of the templates include a set of alternative color palettes for adjusting the theme to custom requirements. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/">Pixelmator Pro</a> is available exclusively <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/pixelmator-pro/id1289583905">from the Mac App Store</a> as a free update for existing users and &#36;49.99 for new customers.

		<description><![CDATA[Several third-party browser companies have experienced a spike in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> installs since Apple made major changes to iOS in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act in the European Union, but many are not happy with Apple's implementation of its default browser choice screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alternative-browser-list-eu.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941009" /><br/>
In iOS 17.4, released last month, Apple no longer limits EU users to the handful of browser options that iOS currently offers as alternatives in other parts of the world. Instead, users in the EU who open Safari for the first time are presented with a choice screen that allows them to opt for a new default browser from a list of popular alternatives in their country.<br/>
<br/>
The change has led to a sharp increase in third-party browser usage, based on several reports. On Wednesday, <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-new-tech-laws-are-working-small-browsers-gain-market-share-2024-04-10/">Reuters</a></em> reported that users of privacy-first browser Aloha had jumped 250% in March. The jump in users largely came in France, Belgium (3x growth), Germany, The Netherlands, Spain and Sweden (2.5x growth), and Denmark, Italy and Poland (2x growth).<br/>
<br/>
Aloha browser markets itself as a privacy focused alternative to browsers that earns its money through paid subscriptions rather than selling ads by tracking users. The Cyprus-based company says it has 10 million monthly average users.<br/>
<br/>
"Before, EU was our number four market, right now it's number two," Aloha CEO Andrew Frost Moroz said in an interview with <em>Reuters</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Norway's Vivaldi browser, Germany's Ecosia and U.S.-based Brave have all seen user numbers rise following the new regulation. U.S.-based DuckDuckGo, which has about 100 million users, and its more popular rival, Norway-based Opera, have also reported substantial increases.<br/>
<br/>
To be eligible for consideration in the alternative browsers list, companies must have the Default Browser Entitlement that is available to developers. Apple also requires that the app has been downloaded by at least 5,000 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users‌ across all 27 EU countries in the prior calendar year. Apple selects up to 11 of these for the browser choice screen in addition to Safari, updating the list once per calendar year. <br/>
<br/>
Google has also updated its Pixel software to show alternative browser choices, and says that new Android devices made by other companies will also display the choice screen in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
Despite users increasingly choosing alternative options, browser companies have criticized Apple and Google for the slow rollout of the change, and believe it is hampering the migration away from Safari and Chrome. Mozilla, which owns Firefox, estimates that only around a fifth of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in the EU have received the iOS update, and claims that the rollout is much slower than Apple's previous software updates.<br/>
<br/>
Some alternative browser makers are also concerned that the design of choice screens is sub-optimal at best. For example, Vivaldi CEO Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner notes that Apple's choice screen only appears when &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users open Safari, while the list of browsers provides no additional information. <br/>
<br/>
"The process is just so convoluted that it's easiest for (users) to select Safari or potentially some other known name," he told <em>Reuters</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Vivaldi is also unhappy with the design. "The list of browsers does not show additional information and that does not help users to make a meaningful choice," a company spokesperson told <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/eu-dma-browser-choice-screen-early-impact/">TechCrunch</a></em>. "If the user has already selected a browser of their own choice, the choice screen can actively try to push them away from it, and may not even include it in the list that it presents to the user."<br/>
<br/>
Ecosia has also been critical, and says Apple's implementation involves an "overly complex installation process" and keeps Safari front and center on the user's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Home screen.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/eu-to-investigate-apple-dma-compliance/">investigating</a> Apple's choice screen design for suspected noncompliance. The probe is being conducted in consultation with browser companies, who are likely to encourage regulators to push for a stronger implementation to level the competitive playing field. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/apple-eu-default-browser-options-criticized/">Browser Companies Criticize Apple&#039;s EU Choice Screen in iOS 17.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/browser-companies-criticize-apples-eu-choice-screen-in-ios-17-4.2424048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google One VPN will be discontinued later this year, according to a customer email seen by <em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/vpn-by-google-one-shut-down-3433530/">Android Authority</a></em>. The service was rolled out for Android in October 2020, before coming to iOS devices and Macs in 2022.<br/>
<br/>

When it originally launched it was part of Google One's Premium 2TB storage plan, priced at &#36;9.99 per month or &#36;99.99 per year. Last year, availability was expanded to all <a href="https://one.google.com">Google One</a> plans, including the cheapest offering for &#36;1.99 per month, making it significantly more affordable.<br/>
<br/>
The company told <em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/11/google-one-vpn-discontinued/">9to5Google</a></em> that it is killing the service because "people simply weren't using it." Existing users will be directed to third-party VPN alternatives instead.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo today announced the launch of <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/meetprivacypro/">Privacy Pro</a>, a new subscription service that bundles three privacy-focused features together.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/duckduckgo-privacy-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945898" /><br/>
Privacy Pro includes a VPN for anonymous browsing and secure connections regardless of location, personal information removal for removing personal data from data broker sites, and identity theft restoration should any DuckDuckGo subscriber suffer from an identity theft situation.<br/>
<br/>
The VPN works on up to five devices simultaneously, so it can be installed and used on a Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and other devices at the same time. It is turned on through the DuckDuckGo browser so a second app is not required, and it does filter traffic through all apps and browsers.<br/>
<br/>
DuckDuckGo's personal information removal tool regularly scans 50 sites that sell information, such as Spokeo. Personal information is stored on device, and removal requests are initiated using the information provided during setup. The process is automated, and there is a dashboard to monitor results.<br/>
<br/>
Identity theft restoration includes the support of a dedicated advisor that will work with users to restore stolen accounts, replace bank cards and other identifying documents, recover financial losses, and correct credit reports.<br/>
<br/>
Privacy Pro from DuckDuckGo is <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/meetprivacypro/">priced at &#36;9.99 per month</a> or &#36;99.99 per year, and it is currently only available in the United States. Users will need to ensure they are using the latest version of the DuckDuckGo browser to take advantage of the features.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duckduckgo/">DuckDuckGo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/duckduckgo-privacy-pro-subscription/">DuckDuckGo Launches 3-in-1 &#039;Privacy Pro&#039; Subscription With VPN and Personal Data Removal Tool</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/duckduckgo-launches-3-in-1-privacy-pro-subscription-with-vpn-and-personal-data-removal-tool.2424020/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular home lighting company <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/">Nanoleaf</a> today introduced its latest product, Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights that bring HomeKit-compatible decorative lighting to decks, porches, backyards, gardens, pool areas, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-outdoor-lights-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945596" /><br/>
Nanoleaf is known for unique light designs, and the Outdoor String Lights aren't an exception. The bulbs have an angular five-sided shape that makes them more geometric than soft. They're made from a hard, clear plastic material and they look like they're made from crystal or ice. If you want cozy, romantic-style lighting, Nanoleaf's lights might not be the right vibe because of the shape, but if you want lights that are fun and eye-catching, these are perfect.<br/>
<br/>
There are multicolor LEDs in each bulb, so you can control the lights individually and set them to any color, including shades of white. If you unscrew one of the bulbs, there's actually a second protective plastic dome inside that further diffuses the light. The bulb shape might not have a cozy feel, but the lights can be soft yellows and whites, or any other shade of the rainbow, plus there are dimming controls. The colors are accurate and it does well with blues, purples, and greens, shades that can sometimes be off with LED lighting.<br/>
<br/>
The Outdoor String Lights are meant for ambient lighting, and even at 100 percent brightness, they're on the dimmer side depending on the colors used. Nanoleaf says they're 55 lumens per bulb, so a 15-meter strand is 1100 lumens total. These are available in 15-meter (49ft) and 30-meter lengths (98ft), with the 15-meter version offering 20 bulbs and the 30-meter version offering 40 bulbs. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-outdoor-lights-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945597" /><br/>
Strands can be connected together, but the maximum length is 45 meters or 147 feet, equivalent to one 30-meter strand and one 15-meter expansion. For anything longer, you'll need separate sets with multiple power supplies. The lights have thick black cabling for weather protection, so these are probably not string lights you're going to want to use indoors unless you have a room where an industrial look works.<br/>
<br/>
There's 6.5 feet of cord between the power supply and the controller and then another foot or so between the controller and the first light. The bulbs are spaced about two feet apart, and they hang down four inches, so they look best when draped down across beams or using outdoor light poles.<br/>
<br/>
The lights have IP65 water resistance and the controller is IP67 rated, so they can be used outdoors in the rain and elements without protection all year. Nanoleaf offers a two-year warranty on the lights.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-outdoor-lights-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="2000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945598" /><br/>
In terms of aesthetics, the Nanoleaf Outdoor Lights are great, but connectivity needs improvement. These connect to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> through Matter, and Matter devices continue to face issues on Apple's platform. I think it's more of an Apple issue than a Nanoleaf issue because I see these same Matter problems regardless of device, but it's a problem any potential buyer needs to be aware of.<br/>
<br/>
The Outdoor String Lights have randomly disconnected or become unreachable for no particular reason a handful of times. Sometimes unplugging them fixes it, and sometimes they just start working again after being unreachable. As a caveat, I don't know if the Matter/&zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; interoperability issue I have is exacerbated by my Wi-Fi network or other factors. I have an Orbi mesh Wi-Fi 6E network, and while my standard &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; products seem to generally be reliable (especially those with hubs), Matter is not. The Outdoor String Lights are mostly functional and the disconnects aren't constant, but it is worth noting that the lights may not always work seamlessly for &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; users.<br/>
<br/>
I would have preferred native &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; support to Matter for the lights, but these are Matter only. There is no Thread support, and as with other Nanoleaf products, you can only use a 2.4GHz network.<br/>
<br/>
On a more positive note, Nanoleaf has one of the better smart home apps. There are built-in scenes available in the app for the Outdoor String Lights, but I can also create my own or use scenes created by other Nanoleaf users. Nanoleaf also has an AI feature where you can type in any phrase like "tropical sunset" or "ocean waves" to get a custom scene in colors that match what you're aiming for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-outdoor-lights-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945599" /><br/>
The AI works with a fairly wide range of suggestions, and I get a good range of colors. The only downside is that it appears to have a single color-shifting pattern, but Nanoleaf does support other patterns when you create your own scenes or download them. As these are able to connect to &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; via Matter, you can use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> commands and turn them on and off with the Home app.<br/>
<br/>
The Home app also supports automations for turning the Outdoor Lights on and off at select times or pairing them with other &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
The Nanoleaf Outdoor String Lights are some of the neatest outdoor lights that I've seen, and the multicolored LEDs pair well with the geometric shape. These are expensive and are not cost efficient if you have a large area to cover in lights, but one or two strands will elevate any outdoor setup.<br/>
<br/>
I have not seen flawless operation from the Outdoor String Lights, and have had to deal with some disconnects, so that's something to be aware of. I am hopeful that Apple and Nanoleaf updates in the future will fix any of the lingering issues that Matter-enabled devices are still experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2><br/>
Nanoleaf's Outdoor String Lights can be <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/essentials/outdoor/multicolor-string-lights/">purchased from the Nanoleaf website</a>. A 15-meter strand is priced at &#36;100, and a 30-meter strand is priced at &#36;180. Additional 15-meter expansion packs are available for &#36;70.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will begin updating its Mac lineup with M4 chips in late 2024, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-11/apple-aapl-readies-m4-chip-mac-line-including-new-macbook-air-and-mac-pro"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The M4 chip will be focused on improving performance for artificial intelligence capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-silicon-feature-joeblue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945652" /><br/>
Last year, Apple introduced the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips all at once in October, so it's possible we could see the M4 lineup come during the same time frame. Gurman says that the entire Mac lineup is slated to get the M4 across late 2024 and early 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, high-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> machines will be updated with M4 chips first, followed by the 13-inch and 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models in spring 2025, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> in mid-2025, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> later in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be nearing production of the M4 processor, and it is expected to come in at least three main varieties. Chips are codenamed Donan for the low-end, Brava for the mid-tier, and Hidra for the top-end. The Donan chip will be used in the entry-level MacBook Pro, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; machines, and the low-end &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, and the Brava chips will be used in the higher-end MacBook Pro and the higher-end &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The Hidra chip is designed for the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;, which suggests it is an "Ultra" or "Extreme" tier chip. As for the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, Apple is testing versions with an unreleased M3-era chip and a variation of the M4 Brava processor that would presumably be higher tier than the M4 Pro and M4 Max "Brava" chips. <br/>
<br/>
M4 versions of the Mac desktops could support as much as 512GB Unified Memory, which would be a marked jump over the current 192GB limit.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that customers and independent repair shops will be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/apple-to-allow-used-parts-for-repairs/">repair select iPhones with used genuine Apple parts</a> starting later this year. Alongside the announcement, Apple's hardware engineering chief John Ternus <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2024/04/11/apple-opens-access-to-used-iphone-components-for-repair/">spoke with <em>TechCrunch</em></a> about the iPhone's controversial "parts pairing" process.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912514" /><br/>
Repair website iFixit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ifixit-lowers-iphone-14-repairability-score/">criticized Apple's parts pairing process</a> last year, and Oregon recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/oregon-right-to-repair-law/">passed a law</a> that would ban Apple from using a "parts pairing" process in the state for devices manufactured after January 1, 2025. <br/>
<br/>
Ternus argued that iPhones still work with most third-party parts:<blockquote>"'Parts pairing' is used a lot outside and has this negative connotation," Apple senior vice president of hardware engineering, John Ternus, tells TechCrunch. "I think it's led people to believe that we somehow block third-party parts from working, which we don't. The way we look at it is, we need to know what part is in the device, for a few reasons. One, we need to authenticate that it's a real Apple biometric device and that it hasn't been spoofed or something like that. … Calibration is the other one."</blockquote>One exception is third-party parts related to Face ID and Touch ID, which do not work in iPhones for security reasons, according to Ternus:<blockquote>"You think about Touch ID and Face ID and the criticality of their security because of how much of our information is on our phones," says Ternus. "Our entire life is on our phones. We have no way of validating the performance of any third-party biometrics. That's an area where we don't enable the use of third-party modules for the key security functions. But in all other aspects, we do."</blockquote>Apple does alert customers if an iPhone part is not genuine. If an iPhone has been repaired, a "Parts and Service History" section appears in the Settings app under General → About, and it shows if non-genuine Apple parts have been installed.<br/>
<br/>
Ternus said this transparency surrounding repairs is important:<blockquote>"We have hundreds of millions of iPhones in use that are second- or third-hand devices," he explains. "They're a great way for people to get into the iPhone experience at a lower price point. We think it's important for them to have the transparency of: was a repair done on this device? What part was used? That sort of thing."</blockquote>Apple says it will be expanding the "Parts and Service History" section to show whether a used part is a genuine Apple part later this year.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-to-expand-repair-options-with-support-for-used-genuine-parts/">announced</a> that customers and independent repair shops will be able to utilize used genuine Apple parts in repairs starting later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Self-Service-Repair-Program-iPhone.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895789" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/11/apple-repaired-used-parts-pairing/">told <em>The Washington Post</em></a> that the new policy will initially apply to parts for iPhone 15 models and newer, including screens, batteries, and cameras. Apple's press release said the policy will eventually extend to used biometric sensors for Face ID and Touch ID. Apple's existing parts "pairing" process will confirm whether or not a used part is genuine.<br/>
<br/>
In the fall, Apple says calibration for both new and used genuine Apple parts will happen on device after the part is installed. If an iPhone has been repaired, a "Parts and Service History" section appears in the Settings app under General → About, and Apple says it will be expanding this section to show whether a genuine part is new or used.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also announced that customers and service providers will no longer need to provide a device's serial number when ordering parts from its <a href="https://selfservicerepair.com/">self-service repair store</a> for repairs not involving replacement of the logic board.<br/>
<br/>
To deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts, Apple said it will be extending its Activation Lock security feature to iPhone parts:<blockquote>Apple will also extend its popular Activation Lock feature to iPhone parts in order to deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts. Requested by customers and law enforcement officials, the feature was designed to limit iPhone theft by blocking a lost or stolen iPhone from being reactivated. If a device under repair detects that a supported part was obtained from another device with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled, calibration capabilities for that part will be restricted.</blockquote>Apple's hardware engineering chief John Ternus said the new policy will be more environmentally friendly by extending the lifespan of parts:<blockquote>For the last two years, teams across Apple have been innovating on product design and manufacturing to support repairs with used Apple parts that won't compromise users' safety, security, or privacy. With this latest expansion to our repair program, we're excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our customers, while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts.</blockquote>Apple said the policy will apply to future iPhone models.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google next month will make its latest AI-powered photo editing feature available to all users of Google Photos on iOS, the company has <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-editing-features-availability/">announced</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/google-photos-magic-editor.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945799" /><br/>
Magic Editor, which featured heavily in last year's Google Pixel 8 series marketing blitz, uses generative AI to perform complicated photo edits, such as filling in gaps in a photo, repositioning subjects, and additional foreground/background adjustments like making a cloudy, grey sky look blue.<br/>
<br/>
The edits mimic the kind of possibilities afforded by more professional editing tools like Photoshop, except Magic Editor achieves its automated results via AI, rather than the user having to do them manually.<br/>
<br/>
The editing tool debuted as one of the headline AI features on the company's flagship phone when it launched six months ago, and has since been exclusive to Google Pixel 8 owners and Google One subscribers. The tool will become available to all users of Google Photos starting May 15.<br/>
<br/>
Google Photos for iOS and Android will include 10 Magic Editor saves per month. To use more than that, users will need to buy a Premium Google One plan, which starts at 2TB of storage for &#36;10 per month or &#36;100 annually.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to Magic Editor, Google is bringing <a href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/268658175/ai-editing-tools-are-coming-to-all-google-photos-users">several more editing tools</a> to Google Photos, including Photo Unblur, Sky suggestions, Color pop, HDR effect for photos and videos, Portrait Blur, Portrait Light (plus its add light/balance light features), Cinematic Photos, Styles in the Collage Editor, and Video Effects.<br/>
<br/>
To use the AI features, Apple devices must be running iOS 15 or later. Google Photos is a free download for iPhone and iPad <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/google-photos/id962194608">available on the App Store</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-photos/">Google Photos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/google-pixel-magic-editor-coming-to-iphone/">Google Pixel 8&#039;s Flagship AI Photo Editing Feature Coming to iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-pixel-8s-flagship-ai-photo-editing-feature-coming-to-iphones.2423988/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Warns Users in 92 Countries About Mercenary Spyware Attacks</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Wednesday sent threat notifications to users in 92 countries warning that they may have been targeted by mercenary spyware attacks, likely because of who they are or what they do.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-security-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1145" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-796484" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/apple-warning-mercenary-spyware-attacks/">TechCrunch</a></em>, Apple sent the alerts to the individuals at 12 p.m. Pacific Time, delivered via email and iMessage using the contact details associated with the user's Apple ID. A notification also appears at the top of the page if the user signs into <a href="https://appleid.apple.com">appleid.apple.com</a>.<br/>
<blockquote>"Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-," the company wrote in the warning to affected customers. "We are unable to provide more information about what caused us to send you this notification, as that may help mercenary spyware attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future."<br/>
<br/>
"This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it's never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously," added the warning.</blockquote>In an updated <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102174">support document</a>, Apple said it has sent similar threat notifications to users in over 150 countries since 2021. "The extreme cost, sophistication, and worldwide nature of mercenary spyware attacks makes them some of the most advanced digital threats in existence today," said the company. "As a result, Apple does not attribute the attacks or resulting threat notifications to any specific attackers or geographical regions."<br/>
<br/>
Last October, Apple sent similar warnings to some journalists and politicians in India. Soon after, nonprofit advocacy group Amnesty International reported that it had found Israeli cyber-arms company NSO Group's invasive spyware Pegasus on the iPhones of prominent journalists in India. Users in India are among those who received the latest threat notifications, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to <em>TechCrunch</em>.<br/>
<br/>
The alerts come at a time when many nations are preparing for democratic elections. Apple previously described the attackers as "state-sponsored" in the support document, but has replaced those references with "mercenary spyware attacks." The warning to customers reads: "Mercenary spyware attacks, such as those using Pegasus from the NSO Group, are exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware." <br/>
<br/>
Apple advises those who have received a threat notification to seek expert help, such as the rapid-response emergency security assistance provided by the Digital Security Helpline at the nonprofit Access Now. Apple threat notification recipients can contact the Digital Security Helpline 24 hours a day, seven days a week <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/">through their website</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Users who have not received an Apple threat notification but have good reason to believe they may be individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks are advised to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-lockdown-mode-ios/">enable Lockdown Mode</a> on their devices for additional protection.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/">Apple Security</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/apple-warns-users-mercenary-spyware-attacks/">Apple Warns Users in 92 Countries About Mercenary Spyware Attacks</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-warns-users-in-92-countries-about-mercenary-spyware-attacks.2423987/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The touch-related bug that was known to be impacting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> also affects the Apple Watch Series 7, Series 8, and Ultra 1, Apple <a href="https://twitter.com/stellafudge/status/1778197004029394994">said in a memo</a> shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-watch-series-8-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901498" /><br/>
Service providers have been told not to replace watches for the ghost touch problem, instead instructing customers to fix the issue <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/force-restart-your-apple-watch/">through a force restart</a>. A force restart can be initiated by simultaneously holding down the side button and the Digital Crown for 10 seconds. AASPs have also been asked to make sure affected Apple Watches are running the latest version of watchOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first began looking into the touch-related problem affecting some Apple Watch models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/10/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-touch-screen-issue/">in February</a>. At the time, it was a bug that had been seen on the Series 9 and the Ultra 2. Apple Watch owners were experiencing "false" or "ghost" touches on the display, which could cause the screen to "jump erratically" or exhibit unexpected behavior without user interaction.<br/>
<br/>
A fix for the ghost touch issue was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-watchos-10-4/">added in watchOS 10.4</a>, so presumably that version of the software addresses the issue on all impacted models. If not, the wording of Apple's memo suggests a further fix will be coming in the near future.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/apple-watch-ghost-touch-issue-series-7/">Apple Suggests Solution for &#039;Ghost Touch&#039; Issue on Apple Watch Series 7 and Later</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-suggests-solution-for-ghost-touch-issue-on-apple-watch-series-7-and-later.2423963/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 192 includes fixes and updates for Authentication, CSS, Editing, JavaScript, Media, Rendering, Web API, and Web Extensions. <br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-192/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 192 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-192-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2423956/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple employees at the <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/shorthills/">Apple Store in Short Hills</a>, New Jersey have petitioned to unionize, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-10/apple-store-in-new-jersey-files-to-unionize-in-renewed-effort">Bloomberg</a></em>. Retail store unionization efforts have died down in recent months after locations in Oklahoma and Maryland <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/14/apple-store-oklahoma-city-unionizes/">successfully unionized</a> in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-short-hills-new-jersey.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945775" /><br/>
There are 104 workers at Apple Short Hills, which is located in the Short Hills Mall. Communication Workers of America (CWA) filed a unionization petition with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of employees earlier this week.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement, the CWA said that forming a union would be the best way to "ensure all Apple workers receive the respect, pay, benefits and working conditions" that they deserve. The group has requested that Apple "not to interfere in our ongoing organizing efforts and, instead, allow workers to freely determine for themselves whether to form a union."<br/>
<br/>
Apple told <em>Bloomberg</em> that it offers "exceptional" benefits and competitive pay to its employees.<br/>
<blockquote>We have always paid our retail teams in the top tier of the market. And we provide exceptional and comprehensive benefits for all full- and part-time employees as a part of the overall support we provide to our valued team members.</blockquote><br/>
Following the petition, workers at the store will need to vote on whether to join the union. If a majority decide to do so, the store will unionize. Union employees are able to negotiate with Apple for improved working conditions and benefits. In Maryland, workers have been working to negotiate with Apple for a 10 percent pay increase, tips from customers, and changes to overtime and leave policies.<br/>
<br/>
While two stores have unionized, unionization efforts have failed in other locations. An Apple retail location in St. Louis <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/05/apple-st-louis-rejects-unionization/">voted not to unionize</a>, and a store in Atlanta withdrew its request to unionize after alleged interference from Apple. The U.S. National Labor Relations Board said in December 2022 that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/05/apple-atlanta-illegal-anti-union-tactics/">violated federal law</a> by holding mandatory anti-union meetings and coercing and interrogating the Atlanta workers.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/apple-store-new-jersey-union-filing/">Apple Store Employees in New Jersey File to Unionize</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-employees-in-new-jersey-file-to-unionize.2423952/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It's been a bit over six months since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup came out in September, and <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera has been using an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max sans case since launch. Over on our YouTube channel, Dan did a long term review to demo how his phone has held up and his thoughts on the Action button, battery life, and camera features.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYOXToOgmSs" title="iPhone 15 Pro Max Review: 6 Months Later!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max are Apple's first iPhones with a titanium shell instead of a stainless steel or aluminum shell, and titanium is supposed to be more durable. After suffering from several drops without a case, Dan's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is scuffed and chipped, but there are no scratches. As for the screen, it has a minor scratch or two.<br/>
<br/>
Battery health is at 98 percent and 174 cycles, and there have been some fluctuations in battery life with software updates. It's a little hard to get a solid read on battery because of day-to-day differences in usage.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have had trouble finding a use for the Action button, but assigning it to the camera is one way to ensure that it gets used. With the camera setting, a quick press on the button launches the camera so there's no need to press on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or open up the Camera app. Apple is rumored to be adding a dedicated Capture button for the camera with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, so the Action button might get less useful at that point for those who use it for the camera.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-ios-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">first iOS 17.5 beta</a> is slim on new features, there is one fun addition for Apple News+ subscribers: a daily word game called Quartiles.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-17.5-Quartiles-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945719" /><br/>
<br/>
Quartiles tasks you with combining tiles to form words and earn points. Each puzzle starts with a grid of 20 tiles, and words can be formed with one to four tiles. A quartile is a four-tile word, and if you find all five in each puzzle, you earn a 40-point bonus. The website <em>Gadget Hacks</em> shared a <a href="https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/apple-has-killer-new-word-game-puzzle-called-quartiles-hiding-ios-17-5-0385513/">walkthrough of the game</a> with more details.<br/>
<br/>
Quartiles is the third puzzle game included with an Apple News+ subscription, alongside Crossword and Crossword Mini. Starting with the iOS 17.5 beta, all three games integrate with Game Center to display leaderboards.<br/>
<br/>
On an iPhone updated to the iOS 17.5 beta, Quartiles can be found in the Apple News app under the Following tab → Puzzles. The game is also available on the iPad and Mac starting with the iPadOS 17.5 and macOS 14.5 betas.<br/>
<br/>
Apple News+ is available in the U.S., Australia, Canada, and the U.K., but the puzzle games seem to be limited to the U.S. and Canada for now.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5 will likely be released in May.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/">Apple News</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-17-5-apple-news-quartiles-game/">iOS 17.5 Adds New &#039;Quartiles&#039; Word Game for Apple News+ Subscribers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-5-adds-new-quartiles-word-game-for-apple-news-subscribers.2423939/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

This price is only available in the (PRODUCT)RED color, and it's a limited time deal at Amazon so be sure to check out the sale before it's fully claimed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-watch-9-red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945687" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
This is a new all-time low price on this model of the Series 9, beating previous low prices by about &#36;5. Unfortunately, there aren't really any notable Apple Watch deals besides this sale, so you'll need to be sure the 41mm case size with the M/L Sport Band will fit your wrist.<br/>
<br/>
