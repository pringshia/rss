		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/">developer documentation</a> outlining systemwide changes to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> in the European Union, Apple explains why alternative app stores, alternative payment options, and other updates are being limited to the EU.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/07/iPhone-Security-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2844" height="1600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-751214" /><br/>
Apple claims that these changes are introducing notable risks for users and developers, introducing "new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats."<br/>
<br/>
Further, Apple says that the updates compromise its ability to "detect, prevent, and take action" against malicious apps, and also to support users impacted by issues with apps that are downloaded outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
"We're limiting these changes to the European Union because we're concerned about their impacts on the privacy and security of our users' experience - which remains our North Star," Apple writes.<br/>
<br/>
To limit risk, Apple is requiring alternative app stores to undergo a notarization process that will check for malware and viruses, but Apple will not evaluate an app's content. Though notarization will add safeguards, Apple says there is risk involved with the alternate app store system.<br/>
<blockquote>If not properly managed, alternative distribution poses increased privacy, safety, and security risks for users and developers. This includes risks from installing software from unknown developers that are not subject to the Apple Developer Program requirements, installing software that compromises system integrity with malware or other malicious code, the distribution of pirated software, exposure to illicit, objectionable, and harmful content due to lower content and moderation standards, and increased risks of scams, fraud, and abuse. Apple has less ability to address these risks, and to support and refund customers regarding these issues. Even with safeguards, many of these risks remain.</blockquote><br/>
Going forward, Apple plans to engage with the European Union, developer community, and EU users about the impacts of alternative app stores.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of the EU, app developers must continue to use the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and in-app purchase system as usual.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/alternative-app-store-eu-risks/">Apple Limiting Alternative App Stores and Payments to EU Due to Malware, Fraud and Scam Risks</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-limiting-alternative-app-stores-and-payments-to-eu-due-to-malware-fraud-and-scam-risks.2417436/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in iOS 17.4 will begin allowing apps in the European Union to be distributed through alternative app stores rather than the iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, but the Cupertino company warns that this means certain features users have come to rely on will not work as they do for standard &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; apps.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Clorange.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833988" /><br/>
Restrictions on In-App Purchases in Screen Time will not be available, for example, nor will Family Purchase Sharing for apps and subscriptions that are made outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Ask to Buy is not a supported feature, and universal purchase, a feature that allows apps to work across all of a user's devices, is not offered. <br/>
<br/>
Apple will not be able to offer these features because it will not be facilitating purchases of apps distributed through alternative app stores. <br/>
<br/>
Screen Time, parental controls, and Spotlight will continue to function, according to Apple, but parents will need to adjust to not having access to purchasing restrictions for apps installed outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also warns that it will not be able to assist users with refunds, purchase history, subscription management and cancelation, violations of user data privacy, abuse, or fraud and manipulations. <br/>
<br/>
Developers or the alternative app marketplace an app was downloaded from will need to handle issues like refunds and subscription cancelations. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users will be able to choose not to install apps outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, of course, and these changes are limited to users in the European Union. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.4 beta that was released today introduces new emoji characters, which include lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/emojipedia-15-1-emoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903229" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Mockup of new emoji <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/whats-new-in-unicode-15-1-and-emoji-15-1/">via Emojipedia</a></div></em><br/>
These characters are part of the Unicode 15.1 update that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ios-17-future-emoji/">approved in September 2023</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There are also four new family emoji combinations, along with updates to six people emoji that now have direction specifications such as facing right or facing left. The direction options can be used with person walking, person running, person kneeling, person with white cane, person in manual wheelchair, and person in motorized wheelchair.<br/>
<br/>
This is a smaller update than we typically get, with fewer emoji characters, but that is because it is a .1 Unicode Consortium update rather than a major point update.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 is limited to developers at the current time, but it should soon be coming to public beta testers. It will see an official launch sometime in March.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-adds-new-emoji/">iOS 17.4 Beta Adds New Emoji: Shaking Head, Lime, Phoenix, Brown Mushroom and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-beta-adds-new-emoji-shaking-head-lime-phoenix-brown-mushroom-and-more.2417425/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As part of major changes being made to the app ecosystem in the EU in iOS 17.4, Apple is allowing apps to access and use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s NFC chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-pay-feature-dynamic-island.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921515" /><br/>
Going forward, NFC payments will be available directly in apps without the need for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or the Wallet app, paving the way for third-party payment services and banks to offer their own tap-to-pay solutions on Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users can set a default app that will be activated when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is near an NFC terminal or when the side button on the device is double clicked, which means native support for tap-to-pay payments that are not &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; is now available.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will require apps using NFC for payments to confirm to industry security standards, such as having valid agreements with an authorized Payment Service Provider.<br/>
<br/>
Like changes to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> that are being implemented today, access to NFC technology is limited to banking and wallet apps that are in the European Economic Area.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-nfc-third-party-apps-eu/">Apple Opens Up NFC to Third-Party Apps in EU, Allowing New Tap-to-Pay Options</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-opens-up-nfc-to-third-party-apps-in-eu-allowing-new-tap-to-pay-options.2417424/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the iOS 17.4 update, Apple is making sweeping changes to iOS in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act in the European Union. Apple is opening up the browser engine, and giving users more choice over what apps and services they use as the defaults on their devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" /><br/>
Users in the EU who update to iOS 17.4 will be presented with a splash screen upon opening Safari that allows them to choose a new default browser. Apple is not providing just the standard browsers that have been options on iOS in the past, but a list of the most downloaded browsers on iOS devices. Some of the options include Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge. <br/>
<br/>
Browser apps can also now use browser engines other than WebKit, both for browser apps and in-app browsing experiences within apps. At the current time, Apple requires all browsers on iOS to use the WebKit engine, including popular options like Chrome and Firefox. Going forward, Chrome will be able to use Blink, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Users will also be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">choose a default app marketplace</a>, thanks to support for alternative marketplaces, and they will be able to select a default contactless app for contactless payments. These changes are limited to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users in the European Union, and they are being implemented as part of iOS 17.4, which is available to developers as a beta as of today.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-eu-ios-17-4/">Apple Now Allowing Non-WebKit Engines in EU, Offering More Options for Changing Default Browser</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-allowing-non-webkit-engines-in-eu-offering-more-options-for-changing-default-browser.2417423/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=f1v8pyay">announced</a> that it now allows streaming game apps on the App Store worldwide, in response to feedback from developers. This will pave the way for services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW to be available as standalone iPhone and iPad apps, whereas they were previously only accessible via the web.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/App-Store-and-XCloud.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-758525" /><br/>
These cloud gaming apps will allow iPhone and iPad users to stream games from servers, with the entire selection of games available within a single app.<br/>
<br/>
"Developers can now submit a single app with the capability to stream all of the games offered in their catalog," reads Apple's announcement.<br/>
<br/>
Streaming game apps will need to maintain an age rating of the highest age-rated content included in the app, and the apps will of course also need to respect all of the latest App Store Review Guidelines, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also announced that mini-apps, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins will be able to use Apple's in-app purchase system for digital content and services worldwide. For example, Apple says users could subscribe to an individual chatbot.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-allows-game-streaming-apps-on-app-store/">Apple Now Allows Game Streaming Apps on App Store Worldwide</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-allows-game-streaming-apps-on-app-store-worldwide.2417422/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced major changes to its app ecosystem in the European Union, implementing updates that will allow <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users to download and install apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> through alternative app marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
Alternative app marketplaces will function as an iOS app that is able to install other iOS apps on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. Any developer can create an app marketplace, so long as they meet Apple's criteria for customer experience, fraud prevention, customer support, and more. Apple is creating new APIs to build marketplaces on iOS to distribute apps to users. <br/>
<br/>
In the EU, when an app developer submits an app to Apple for distribution, they can choose the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; or any alternative app marketplaces. This includes distribution through multiple alternative app marketplaces or through both the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and an app marketplace. <br/>
<br/>
Apps installed through alternative app stores will need to go through a notarization process that includes safety and security checks, which is how Mac apps work. <br/>
<br/>
Apple will not charge a commission on apps installed through alternative marketplaces, nor will it charge commission for alternative payment systems, which are also allowed under the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; updates in the European Union. Developers can integrate an alternative payment processor into their app that allows a user to make a purchase and check out entirely in an app, or developers can link out to their websites where users can make a purchase. <br/>
<br/>
While there are no commissions for alternative app marketplaces and alternative payment systems, there is a Core Technology Fee that is .50 euros per install per account on an annual basis. The first 1 million installs are free for all developers, but after 1 million installs, the fee comes into play.<br/>
<br/>
App developers who choose to continue to distribute under the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will pay Apple reduced commission with the new terms. Apple is dropping the 30 percent commission to 17 percent, and the 15 percent commission paid for subscriptions over a year old or by small businesses will drop to 10 percent. Apple says the vast majority of apps will qualify for the 10 percent rate. <br/>
<br/>
Developers have a choice between opting into the new business terms in the EU or sticking with the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; terms as they are today. Developers who choose to maintain the status quo will pay the fees they pay now -- 15 to 30 percent commission.<br/>
<br/>
Developers who opt for the updated business terms will pay the reduced commissions, will have access to alternative app stores, and will also be subject to the Core Technology Fee. There is an also optional 3 percent payment processing fee for those who choose to continue to use Apple's integrated payment system rather than an alternative payment system under the new terms. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's Core Technology Fee will be paid annually, and Apple says that the fee reflects the value that developers get from Apple's tools and platform. Apps distributed by government agencies, non-profits, and educational institutions will be exempt from the Core Technology Fee. To help developers decide between the existing policies and the new system, Apple is providing a fee calculator and analytics report for the first annual install metric. <br/>
<br/>
Apple believes that allowing for alternative app installations will bring a major risk to platform integrity, but the measures that it is taking with notarization are aimed at reducing the risk of malware and other issues as much as possible. Apple's automated notarization checks will scan for known viruses and malware, plus there will be a baseline human review to ensure an app meets platform policies for security and privacy.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; review, notarization will not enforce quality or content standards.There will be a system sheet for a notarized app that displays the app's name, screenshots, and more so that a user can verify an app's information before choosing to install it. <br/>
<br/>
Users will be able to install multiple app marketplace apps, and they will need to give permission before an app marketplace can install apps on a device. There is a management system in the Settings app that allows users to revoke permissions for app marketplaces and also, set a default app marketplace on their device.<br/>
<br/>
There are other changes coming as well. Users in the European Union will have an option to choose a default browser after updating to iOS 17.4, with Apple providing a list of the most downloaded browsers. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is giving app developers in the EU access to NFC and allowing for alternative browser engines, so WebKit will not be required for third-party browser apps. Apps will be able to offer NFC payments without using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or the Wallet app through Host Card Emulation. Apps can also access field detect, and a default app can be set to activate when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is placed near a terminal.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 betas to developers for testing purposes, with the updates coming a day after the launches of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-releases-ios-17-3/">iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has a March 6 deadline to introduce app sideloading in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">iOS 17.4 will add support for this</a>. Sideloading will allow Apple users in Europe to download apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, but the change will be limited to the EU and won't impact customers in other parts of the world. <br/>
<br/>
There's no word yet on what else is included in iOS 17.4, but Apple's updates around this time often introduce new emoji characters. If there are indeed new emoji in the update, we can expect to see the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ios-17-future-emoji/">Unicode 15.1 additions</a>, which include phoenix, lime, an edible mushroom, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake), and broken chain.<br/>

<br/>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.4 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software releases are usually minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/tvos-17-4-beta-1/">Apple Seeds First Beta of tvOS 17.4 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-tvos-17-4-to-developers.2417421/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the past few weeks, some Mac users have complained that their computer automatically upgraded itself from macOS Ventura to the latest macOS Sonoma release, even with the automatic updates setting turned off.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/sonoma-desktop-wwdc.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900001" /><br/>
There are widespread complaints about this issue across the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255413533">Apple Support Community</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ventura-magically-updated-to-sonoma.2416284/">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/193tmio/macos_monterey_automatically_updated_to_sonoma/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/macz_music/status/1748747516839936403">X</a>, and <a href="https://www.askwoody.com/forums/topic/forced-upgrade-to-macos-sonoma/">other</a> <a href="https://talk.tidbits.com/t/apple-just-force-upgraded-me-to-sonoma/26342">websites</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In most cases, it appears that affected users received a desktop notification alerting them that macOS Sonoma was an available software update. However, despite dismissing the notification and having automatic updates turned off, affected users said their Mac proceeded to install macOS Sonoma regardless. Apple began showing the notification to users on January 10, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The underlying cause of the issue is unclear, and an Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to downgrade a Mac to an older macOS version by using a bootable installer to erase and install the older version and then restoring your data from a Time Machine backup. Always make sure to back up your data before downgrading a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
To review your Mac's update settings, open the System Settings app, click General → Software Update, and click the info symbol next to Automatic Updates.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has reportedly cut components orders for its upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models, suggesting that the company is now anticipating lower demand than previously expected.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
According to a report from <a href="https://www.yazhouribao.com/view/20240123075734572"><em>Aju Korea Daily</em></a>, cited by <em><a href="https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/01/25/news-possible-30-cut-in-orders-for-new-ipad-pro-impacting-tsmc-foxconn-and-novatek/">TrendForce</a></em>, Apple has reduced orders of the OLED display panels designed for the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> by 20 to 30%. Apple's original order of ten million panels was split between LG Display, with six million units, and Samsung, with four million units. The cut is expected to hit LG's order specifically, reducing to three or four million units, while Samsung's order remains unchanged. This also suggests that it is primarily the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; that is affected by Apple's expectation of reduced sales, since Samsung is exclusively supplying panels for the 11.1-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/2024-ipad-pro-what-to-expect/">2024 iPad Pro: 12 Rumors About What to Expect</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The scaling back of the order suggests that Apple is now planning to sell fewer new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models than it initially expected. Some reports have suggested that OLED display technology will make the ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">much more expensive</a>. The 11-inch OLED ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ could be priced starting at &#36;1,500, while the 13-inch model could be priced starting at &#36;1,800. Currently, the 11-inch ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ is priced starting at &#36;799, while the 12.9-inch model with a mini-LED display is priced starting at &#36;1,099.

		<description><![CDATA[Security researcher Tommy Mysk has demonstrated that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> push notifications are being used by popular apps to covertly send data about the user. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/iPhone-12-Security-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-778674" /><br/>
In a new video outlining the practice, Mysk highlighted how certain iOS apps exploit a feature introduced in iOS 10 that is designed to allow apps to customize push notifications. This feature, initially intended to enable apps to enrich notifications with additional content or decrypt encrypted messages, has seemingly been repurposed by some developers for more secretive activities. According to Mysk's findings, various popular applications, including TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Bing, are using the short background execution time granted for notification customization to send analytics information.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZPTjGG9t7s?si=A_mDfRwyDBoPV1jK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<br/>
This practice is particularly worrisome because it circumvents the typical restrictions imposed by iOS on background app activities. Apple has always maintained strict control over applications running in the background to protecting user privacy and ensure optimal device performance. However, the push notification feature appears to have unintentionally provided a backdoor for apps to conduct background data transmission.<br/>
<br/>
The type of data being sent includes unique device signals that can be used for fingerprinting and tracking users across different apps. Fingerprinting is a method of collecting specific information about a device, such as its hardware and software configurations, to create a unique identifier for the user. This identifier can then be used to track the user's activities across different applications, which can then be used for various activities such as targeted advertising.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not permit fingerprinting and will soon require developers to explicitly state why their apps need access to APIs that are often used for fingerprinting. This move is in line with Apple's efforts to strengthen user privacy, such as the introduction of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14.5, which requires apps to obtain user permission before tracking their activity across other companies' apps and websites.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/">Apple Security</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/">Apple Privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/push-notifications-leak-user-data/">Research Reveals How iPhone Push Notifications Leak User Data</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/research-reveals-how-iphone-push-notifications-leak-user-data.2417372/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

In the video, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_magpie#Swooping">magpie</a> attempts to attack a woman riding a bicycle, causing her to fall over. In the process, the iPhone she was using for cycling directions also drops to the ground, but it does not suffer damage due in part to the Ceramic Shield.<br/>

		<title>Apple to Get TSMC&#039;s First 2-Nanometer Chips</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will be the first company to receive chips built on the TSMC's future 2-nanometer process, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> said today. According to sources that spoke to the site, Apple is "widely believed to be the initial client to utilize the process."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
The report comes from <em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em> "Tomorrow's Headlines" alert, so additional details may be available in the full news story.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC is expected to begin producing 2nm chips starting in the second half of 2025. Terms like "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a>" and "2nm" refer to the specific architecture and design rules TSMC is using for a family of chips. Decreases in node size correspond to a smaller transistor size, so more transistors can fit on a processor, leading to boosts in speed and more efficient power consumption.<br/>
<br/>
This year, Apple adopted 3-nanometer chips for its iPhones and Macs. Both the A17 Pro chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and the M3 series chips in Macs are built on the 3-nanometer node, an upgrade over the prior 5nm node. The jump from 5nm technology to &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; technology brought notable 20 percent faster GPU speeds, 10 percent faster CPU speed, and a 2x faster Neural Engine to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and similar improvements on Macs.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC is building two new facilities to accommodate 2nm chip production, and working on approval for a third. TSMC generally builds new fabs when it needs to increase production capacity to handle significant orders for chips, and TSMC is expanding in a major way for 2nm technology. The transition to 2nm will see TSMC adopting GAAFET (gate-all-around field-effect transistors) with nanosheets instead of FinFET, so the manufacturing process will be more complex. GAAFETs allow for faster speeds with a smaller transistor size and lower operational voltage.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC is spending billions on the change, and Apple will also need to make chip design changes to accommodate the new technology. Apple is TSMC's main client, and it is typically the first to get TSMC's new chips. Apple acquired <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-buys-all-3nm-tsmc-chips-2023/">all of TSMC's 3-nanometer chips</a> in 2023 for iPhones, iPads, and Macs, for example.<br/>
<br/>
In between the &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; and 2nm nodes, TSMC will introduce several new &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; improvements. TSMC has already come out with N3E and N3P chips that are enhanced &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; processes, and there are other chips in the works such as N3X for high performance computing and N3AE for automotive applications.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that TSMC is already starting work on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/next-gen-chip-technology-on-track-for-2025/">more advanced 1.4-nanometer chips</a>, which are expected to come out as soon as 2027. Apple is said to be looking to reserve TSMC's initial manufacturing capabilities for both 1.4nm and 1nm technologies.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2nm/">2nm</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/apple-tsmc-first-2nm-chips/">Apple to Get TSMC&#039;s First 2-Nanometer Chips</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-get-tsmcs-first-2-nanometer-chips.2417323/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon Stewart is set to return to Comedy Central series "The Daily Show" eight years after he stepped down and handed the reins over to Trever Noah. Stewart plans to host the series every Monday starting on February 12, with a rotating lineup of regular correspondents handling the other days.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Developers who offer the ability to sideload their apps in the European Union will still face restrictions and fees imposed by Apple, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-plans-new-fees-and-restrictions-for-downloads-outside-app-store-f464f426?"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Clorange.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833988" /><br/>
App sideloading capabilities will allow users to download apps from outside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for the first time, but only in the EU. The change is necessitated by the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which seeks to rein in the apparent anticompetitive conduct of big tech companies.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reportedly plans to comply with EU law in a way that retains close control over the apps downloaded outside the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apple has not yet revealed its final plans to comply with this aspect of the DMA, but the <em>WSJ</em> today provided new details citing people familiar with the company's plans. Specifically, Apple will apparently retain the ability to review each app offered outside the app store, as well as take a fee from developers that offer them. <br/>
<br/>
Exact details of the fee structure are unknown, but Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/04/apple-reveals-dutch-in-app-payment-commission/">charges a 27% commission</a> on in-app purchases made through alternative payment systems in the Netherlands, a capability that was initially triggered by a Dutch regulatory ruling. This is just three percent lower than its default fee, but unlike Apple's commission, it does not include tax, making the net total more than Apple's fee for most developers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly been working on the plan for offering sideloading for over a year and the company has held meetings with EU officials in recent months to discuss the new rules. The deadline to enact the changes is Thursday, March 7.<br/>
<br/>
Companies are already said to be lining up to take advantage of the impending changes. For example, Spotify is mulling offering its app via its website to skirt the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, Microsoft has considered launching its own third-party app store specifically for games, and Meta is planning to launch a system to download apps directly from ads.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/sideloading-in-europe-app-review-and-fees/">Report: Sideloading in Europe Will Still Involve App Review and Fees</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-sideloading-in-europe-will-still-involve-app-review-and-fees.2417299/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
