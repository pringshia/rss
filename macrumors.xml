		<description><![CDATA[The list of this week's best deals is headlined by a new record low price on the Apple Pencil 2, but you can also find solid discounts on Apple's M2 Mac mini and Studio Display. We're also still tracking markdowns on a wide variety of Anker products on Amazon.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>20W USB-C Power Adapter</h2><br/>

<br/>
Earlier in the week, Amazon introduced steep &#36;300 discounts on two Studio Displays, and right now you can still save on the nano-texture glass model. It's on sale for &#36;1,599.99 on Amazon, down from &#36;1,899.00, which is a solid second-best price and the first discount we've seen in months.<br/>

		<title>Testing Belkin&#039;s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Belkin recently came out with the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro for capturing video, and while there are several other similar products with video tracking on the market, we thought we'd test Belkin's because it brings something new - support for DockKit.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wj5o8tHCXZM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
DockKit is a feature that provides automated subject tracking technology through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> itself, which means the Stand Pro is the most advanced of the movement tracking stands on the market. Note that the Stand Pro is only for capturing video - it doesn't work with still photos.<br/>
<br/>
The Stand Pro can follow you on camera as you move around a room, offering 360 degrees of panning and 90 degrees of tilting for video calls and recording content. It is compatible with both the front and rear cameras of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and can be used in either vertical or landscape orientation.<br/>
<br/>
The Stand Pro requires an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 or later with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, because it uses a magnetic attachment to hold the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in place. Pairing to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is done through NFC, and then the Stand Pro can be used with any app that needs the camera. It works with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and more, and turning it on and off is as simple as pushing the single button on the device.<br/>
<br/>
With a built-in battery, the Stand Pro can work for up to five hours so it can be used anywhere. When it is plugged in, it can charge a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at up to 15W. Belkin includes a five foot USB-C cable and 30W power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
The Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is <a href="https://www.belkin.com/auto-tracking-stand-pro-with-dockkit/P-MMA008.html">available from Belkin</a> for &#36;180.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/">Belkin</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/belkin-stand-pro-hands-on/">Testing Belkin&#039;s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-belkins-auto-tracking-stand-pro-with-dockkit.2420228/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17.4 Beta Adds New App Verification Screen to App Store in EU</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-beta-4-to-developers/">latest iOS 17.4 beta</a>, Apple asks iPhone users in the EU to verify an app's information before installing it from the App Store. The prompt was spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1761031633774190980">Dimitris Sartzetakis of @iSWUpdates</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1avtztu/ios_17_db4_if_an_app_is_installed_via_spotlight/">others</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Shazam-Authentication-App-Store-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937777" /><br/>
iOS 17.4 will allow iPhone users in the EU to install apps from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">so-called "alternative app marketplaces,"</a> and the verification screen will appear in those storefronts too. Apple is likely aiming to avoid anticompetitive complaints by also showing the prompt in its own App Store, should it remain in the public release of iOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously announced that iOS 17.4 will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/04/ios-17-4-new-features-and-changes/">released in March</a>, and the App Store changes only apply in the <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/easy-read_en">27 countries</a> that are part of the EU, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and others.

		<title>Handful of Apple Vision Pro Units Develop Identical Crack in Cover Glass</title>

		<description><![CDATA[A small number of Apple Vision Pro owners have claimed that their headsets developed a hairline crack down the middle of the front cover glass, despite having never been dropped or mishandled.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/cracked-glass-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937762" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Photo of hairline crack in Vision Pro front glass (credit: Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1axc3bo/sudden_random_crack_in_the_front_glass/">Inphenite</a>)</em></div><br/>
The first report was posted in the subreddit /r/VisionPro about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ajl51r/3_days_in_and_we_have_a_crack_on_the_outer_glass/">18 days ago</a>, and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1axj5sp/woke_up_today_with_a_crack_down_the_front_middle/kror2jt/">several more have appeared</a> in the last week. All of the images show a distinctly similar vertical hairline crack above the nose bridge, implying that the damage is occurring at a particular point of tension, where the curvature of the laminated glass is most pronounced.  <br/>
<br/>
We were unable to find additional similar reports on social media, on Apple's online Support Community, or in the <em>MacRumors</em> forums, suggesting that this is quite possibly a manufacturing defect limited to a small batch of units, rather than a widespread problem.<br/>
<br/>
The reports all mention that the crack became visible suddenly and for no apparent reason, after the headsets had been connected to the external battery pack and stored overnight (some in Apple's Travel Case) with the soft front cover attached. <br/>
<br/>
One theory is that the crack is due to pressure exerted on the glass when tightening the straps, which is causing "bowing" of the surrounding frame. Others speculate that the problem may be due to an overheating issue which is expanding the glass and leading it to crack at its weakest point. Given that the battery is external to the headset, any heat generated would presumably need to be caused by a background software process gone haywire.  <br/>
<br/>
Apple's documentation <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117740">states</a> that Apple Vision Pro continues to draw power from the battery pack when it is not in use, allowing the device to sync mail, photos, and other data. If the headset isn't worn for 24 hours, Vision Pro powers down automatically.<br/>
<br/>
With AppleCare, the deductible fee for a <a href="https://support.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/repair">cover glass repair</a> costs &#36;300. Without AppleCare coverage, the same repair costs &#36;800. Some of the owners affected say they have contacted Apple Support and have been asked to pay the repair costs, since the crack has not officially been identified as a manufacturing defect.<br/>
<br/>
Apple typically introduces special repair programs for products that have a recognized hardware issue, but Apple is unlikely to undertake an internal manufacturing probe unless reports of identical defects become more widespread. Anyone with the same issue is advised to contact <a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/topics">Apple Support</a> and escalate their case to increase the likelihood that Apple sees a potential problem requiring a formal investigation.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/apple-vision-pro-front-glass-cracked-reports/">Handful of Apple Vision Pro Units Develop Identical Crack in Cover Glass</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/handful-of-apple-vision-pro-units-develop-identical-crack-in-cover-glass.2420222/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is relying on different OLED display suppliers for the upcoming 11-inch and 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, with Samsung exclusively producing 11-inch panels and LG making the 13-inch panels. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=26128">The Elec</a></em>, Samsung has cemented its position as the sole supplier of the initial quantity of OLED displays for the 11-inch model, or the first batch to be mass produced for the launch of the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
LG was originally scheduled to also begin producing the 11-inch OLED panel, but as things stand the two panel companies are currently producing only one type of OLED display each. Initial production at both suppliers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/oled-ipad-displays-enter-production/">started last month</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Industry insiders suggest the division of labor is due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies. Apple is rumored to be aiming for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/oled-ipad-lightweight-design-and-image-quality/">"unrivaled" image quality</a>, as well as a design that cuts down on the thickness and weight of the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>‌ display.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Korean-language report, the situation may change after production of the initial quantity, depending on fluctuations in production yield and possible adjustments to Apple's demand forecast for the new &zwnj;OLED &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro&zwnj; models. Apple's shipments forecast for the year have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-planning-to-sell-fewer-oled-ipad-pros/">reportedly</a> decreased to 8 million units, down from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year. <br/>
<br/>
OLED displays are a first for the ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌ lineup. Apple has been using OLED technology for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the Apple Watch, but larger OLED screens are more expensive. Compared to LED or mini-LED, OLED brings deeper blacks and more vivid colors. The OLED ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ models could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">much thinner</a> than the current LED versions thanks to the new display technology. The larger 12.9-inch ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌, for example, could be more than 1mm thinner.<br/>
<br/>
Along with new displays, the ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ models are expected to be powered by Apple's latest M3 chip, which debuted in new MacBook Pro models last year. The M3 is built on 3-nanometer technology, and should bring a notable graphics improvement over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip that is currently used in the ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌. <br/>

The new displays are expected to come to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">as soon as March 2024</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is internally testing a new ChatGPT-like generative AI tool that will enable employees to offer faster technical support going forward.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Support-App-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908138" /><br/>
Apple recently launched a pilot program that provides select AppleCare support advisors with access to a new tool called "Ask" that can automatically generate responses to technical questions they receive from customers, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. Advisors can then relay the info to customers in online chats or on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
"Ask" will automatically respond to a query with relevant information from Apple's internal knowledge base, and advisors can rate an answer as "helpful" or "unhelpful." Advisors can ask up to five follow-up questions per topic. Apple said it plans to make the tool available to more advisors in the future, after collecting feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Apple encourages participating advisors to use "Ask" before using traditional search methods or consulting a senior advisor for info, and it says the tool is useful for solving complex or unfamiliar issues. As the tool is linked to Apple's internal knowledge base, the company ensures that the responses are factual, traceable, and useful.<br/>
<br/>
An example of a query that "Ask" can respond to: "A customer is unable to update their device to iOS 13.7. What can be done?"<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to adopt generative AI in a major way this year. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">iOS 18 will include many new generative AI features</a> across Siri, Spotlight, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, and he was first to report that the AppleCare team would use generative AI to speed up customer support. This is the first time that details about Apple's internal "Ask" tool have been reported.<br/>
<br/>
On an earnings call earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on generative AI and would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a> iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update should be released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022 when OpenAI released <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, a chatbot that can respond to text and voice prompts. The chatbot is trained on large language models, allowing it to respond like a human. OpenAI has also developed tools that can automatically generate <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-3">images</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/sora">videos</a> based on text prompts.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/applecare-advisors-testing-new-ask-tool/">AppleCare Support Advisors Testing New ChatGPT-Like Tool &#039;Ask&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/applecare-support-advisors-testing-new-chatgpt-like-tool-ask.2420196/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> users have been experiencing ongoing Bluetooth connection issues that have persisted since the new devices launched, based on complaints on the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255184161?sortBy=best&amp;page=42">Apple Support Community</a> and the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bluetooth-problems-with-older-devices.2416344/"><em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911148" /><br/>
Affected customers are having trouble keeping their iPhones connected to older Bluetooth devices such as in-car systems or headphones that rely on the technology. From <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bluetooth-problems-with-older-devices.2416344/post-32854348">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Since ios 17 I have been having frequent disconnects in my car (no carplay. BMW 2014) bluetooth for calls. I make a hands free call in my car and after a few seconds bluetooth disconnects and I have manually switch to the speaker in my Iphone. I have had this car since new and I switch iphones almost every year and usually the release x.0 has some bluetooth problems, but now 2 major releases for ios 17 and the issue is not solved. Another iphone 12 does not have the problem in my car.</blockquote><br/>
Many of the complaints come from &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; users who are attempting to connect their iPhones to Bluetooth headphones, car systems, and similar devices, but some users are <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255184161?answerId=259967295022&sortBy=best#259967295022">also experiencing issues</a> with more modern products like the AirPods.<br/>
<blockquote>I moved from 15 plus to 15 pro max (silly but switched carriers so I got it for free) and am having terrible bluetooth connections. Car bluetooth is fine. But on both my AirPods Max and and Beats Studio Buds, my music will cut out and reconnect and calls will drop after 5 to 10 minutes. Done all the resets. Hoping we are sent a software update soon.</blockquote><br/>
Reports of Bluetooth issues date back to October 2023, which is just a month after the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models were released. They have continued across multiple updates, with the most recent reports coming from those running iOS 17.3.1. Some customers were told that the problems would be resolved with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> update, but based on the continuing complaints, it does not appear that Apple has fully resolved the issue as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
The cause of the problem is not clear, but affected users have both &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models. Some people have been able to get their iPhones replaced, which has been the only way to solve the issue. Restarting, resetting, and other typical fixes have not worked for those who are having problems.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In the months leading up to Apple announcing the AirPods Pro in October 2019, the company considered changing the name of the wireless headphones to AirPods Extreme, according to internal information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862208" /><br/>
The name AirPods Extreme was floated by at least one member of Apple's leadership team, but the company ultimately decided to move forward with AirPods Pro branding after many employees objected to the change, we have learned.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has used "Extreme" branding in the past for its discontinued AirPort Extreme router and wireless card for Macs, first released in 2003.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the name AirPods Pro is more consistent with Apple's branding for several product lines. In addition to AirPods, Apple offers both regular and Pro versions of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and there will likely be a regular version of the Apple Vision Pro headset in the future. Nevertheless, Apple has used a few other suffixes for higher-end products over the years, such as the AirPods Max and the Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
Apple went on to release second-generation AirPods Pro in September 2022, and it updated the headphones with a USB-C charging case and a few other features a year later. Third-generation AirPods Pro are rumored to be released in 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/airpods-pro-were-almost-named-airpods-extreme/">AirPods Pro Were Almost Named AirPods Extreme</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-were-almost-named-airpods-extreme.2420187/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Readdle <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/blog">today announced the launch</a> of a new "My Writing Style" artificial intelligence feature created for the <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com">Spark email app</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/spark-my-writing-style.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937595" /><br/>
Spark already had an option for using AI to write emails in different styles like formal, neutral, and friendly, but the updated AI option is designed to write emails in each user's own voice. According to Readdle, it is able to mirror style, tone, and personality traits "to a degree."<br/>
<br/>
Users can enable Spark AI in the Spark Settings, and from there, the app will select three samples of recently sent emails to analyze writing style. This style will then be applied to AI-generated emails and replies.<br/>
<br/>
AI-generated text can be edited and reviewed before it is sent, and there is an option to disable the feature for those who do not want to use it. Spark suggests that the tool is useful for journalists, content creators, researchers, academics, and professional teams.<br/>
<br/>
Readdle recommends providing simple prompts to the AI to get the best results, such as "write an intro email to Bob and suggest setting up a call at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow."<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://sparkmailapp.com">Spark's AI tool</a> uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI as its AI service provider, and it says that data is not used for model training nor stored for more than a month. Spark Premium is required to use the feature, with the Premium update priced at &#36;7.99 per month or &#36;59.99 per year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spark/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/spark-mail-ai-writing-assistant/">Spark Mail Gets &#039;My Writing Style&#039; AI Email Assistant</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spark-mail-gets-my-writing-style-ai-email-assistant.2420185/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amid rumors that the European Commission <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/apple-fined-500-million-eu-music-probe/">will soon fine Apple</a> 500 million euros for breaking EU law over access to streaming music services, Apple today commented on its relationship with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> competitor Spotify and the ongoing complaints that Spotify has made to the EC to attempt to get the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules changed.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801789" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-vs-Spotify-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
In a statement to <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple said that Spotify is aiming to get unlimited access to Apple's tools and services without paying anything for the value that Spotify receives from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<blockquote>"We're happy to support the success of all developers -- including Spotify, which is the largest music streaming app in the world. Spotify pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped them build, update, and share their app with Apple users in 160 countries spanning the globe. Fundamentally, their complaint is about trying to get limitless access to all of Apple's tools without paying anything for the value Apple provides."</blockquote>The European Union's investigation into the streaming music market and Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; policies was initially sparked by Spotify. Spotify has complained multiple times about the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules that prevent it from allowing users to subscribe to Spotify without using in-app purchases and without paying a fee to Apple. <br/>
<br/>
Spotify began working with the European Commission in 2015, and the company filed a final complaint in Europe in 2019. That led to a Statement of Objections from the European Commission in 2021. After that, the European Commission filed a "replacement" Statement of Objections on two separate occasions as it narrowed the focus of its investigation, with the latest statement released in December 2023. Over the last 10 years, Spotify met with the European Commission 65 times in an attempt to convince the EU that Apple's rules negatively impact streaming music services. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says that while Spotify has claimed that Apple policies were harming competition and stifling growth, the streaming music market was in reality growing, presenting a challenge to the European Commission and leading to the revisions in the Statement of Objections. The commission was not able to pursue Apple for requiring app developers to use in-app purchase nor did it find that Apple was harming consumers with anti-competitive practices, so the investigation shifted to the anti-circumvention rules that prevent apps from informing users about lower subscription prices available outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, Spotify wants to rewrite the rules for its own gain. Apple does not believe that Spotify's complaints are about competition or finding a better deal for consumers -- it says Spotify simply wants a better deal and is using the European Commission to try to get it. Spotify wants access to Apple's technology, &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; reach, and to monetize through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; without paying anything to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission has said that Apple's anti-circumvention rules are "detrimental to users of music streaming services on Apple's mobile devices" and could lead to confusion for consumers that results in higher prices, but it is Apple's opinion that the European Commission's view on this point is misguided and has been heavily influenced by Spotify's ongoing complaints. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says that Spotify is the dominant streaming music provider in Europe and other countries, and that much of the company's success can be attributed to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Spotify's apps are able to work seamlessly across Apple devices because of Apple's engineering efforts. Spotify has used TestFlight for almost 500 versions of its app, and it uses thousands of Apple's APIs across 60 frameworks.<br/>
<br/>
If and when the EU fines Apple over this matter, the company will almost certainly appeal the decision, so the antitrust battle between Apple and Spotify is likely far from over. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> In a statement, Spotify said it does not have a level playing field with Apple and trusts that the European Commission will take action to create a fair ecosystem.<blockquote>Spotify’s success has happened despite Apple's best efforts to gain an artificial advantage by favoring their own music service at every turn while placing roadblocks and imposing unfair restrictions on ours. Under their current rules Apple controls Spotify’s access to its own customers and gives Spotify one of two untenable options: We either have to deliver a poor user experience where we can’t directly communicate how to buy or subscribe to Spotify on iPhones or we have to accept a 30% cost disadvantage against our biggest competitor. This is not a level playing field. We support the European Commission and trust that they will take action soon to create a fair ecosystem for everyone involved.</blockquote><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today announced the launch of a new "Help me Write" feature that is available for the Chrome browser on both Macs and Windows PCs. It is a tool that is able to help users start writing something, or refine something that's already been written.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/google-help-me-write-example-1.jpg" alt="" width="1581" height="889" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937562" /><br/>
Help me Write uses the Gemini model that Google announced back in December. At the time, Google said that Gemini was its most capable and general model to date, created through large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google.<br/>
<br/>
According to Google, the Help me Write feature can be used for everything from online reviews to support requests to product listings. The AI model is able to understand the context of the webpage that the user is on to provide suggestions for relevant content.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/google-help-me-write-example-2.jpg" alt="" width="1533" height="862" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937563" /><br/>
As an example, a person writing a review for a pair of shoes might see suggestions that include key features from the product page that support the user's opinion to make a review more valuable. For an online listing of something that's being sold on eBay or another site, users can write a quick outline and have the Help me Write feature provide a more well-written summary. The same goes for online support inquiries.<br/>
<br/>
Help me Write is available in Chrome M122, and it can be used in the United States in English. The feature can be enabled by signing into Chrome, selecting the Settings option from the three-dot menu, and navigating to the Experimental AI page. To use it, right click on any open text field in Chrome and choose the Help me Write option.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/">Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/google-chrome-mac-help-me-write-ai/">Chrome for Mac Gains &#039;Help Me Write&#039; Generative AI Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chrome-for-mac-gains-help-me-write-generative-ai-feature.2420158/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is now deciding on the design of its first foldable device as work on the project ramps up, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240221PD221.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/FoldPad-Redux-24-Magenta-and-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-934078" /><br/>
Citing Taiwanese supply chain sources in a paywalled report, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> claims that Apple has been developing its first foldable product for at least five years. Corroborating previous rumors, the publication claims that the foldable is set to be a "larger device" rather than an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, instead embodying a tablet or notebook. Design efforts on the device are now said to be converging ahead of plans for mass production.<br/>
<br/>
Since hinge mechanisms for foldable devices have become increasingly advanced in recent years, the main problem for Apple's foldable is said to be developing a panel that meets its quality demands. The report adds that Apple's rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/foldable-iphone-paused-failing-screens/">suspension of Samsung foldable display panel development</a> and internal reorganization to move Vision Pro engineers to the foldable project are not contradictory moves, since the company is overwhelmingly prioritizing quality.<br/>
<br/>
The report clarified that Apple has not suspended work on foldable devices, with the company allegedly now possessing multiple departments responsible for different foldable product lines. Apple's first foldable device will not launch until 2025 at the earliest.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/">Foldable MacBook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/first-apple-foldable-wont-be-an-iphone/">Apple&#039;s First Foldable Device Won&#039;t Be an iPhone, Say Supply Chain Sources</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-foldable-device-wont-be-an-iphone-say-supply-chain-sources.2420149/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp has added new text formatting options to the chat platform, enabling users to message each other everything from grocery lists to step-by-step instructions in mid-conversation. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/whatsapp-formatting-options.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937510" /><br/>
Following Wednesday's update, WhatsApp users can now use bulleted and numbered lists, block quotes, and inline code to communicate more effectively. <br/>
<br/>
The new formatting options join the existing bold, italic, strikethrough, and monospaced formats that have been available to WhatsApp users for a while now.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>How to Use New WhatsApp Text Formatting Options</h3><br/>
<ul><li><strong>Bulleted list</strong>: Start a new line with a - (dash) symbol, followed by a space.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Numbered list</strong>: Start a new line with 1 or 2 digits, followed by a period and a space.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Block quote</strong>: Start a new line with the > symbol, followed by a space.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Inline code</strong>: Wrap any code or text you want to highlight using the ` (backtick) symbol.</li></ul><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/whatsapp-text-formatting-options.jpg" alt="whatsapp" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937511" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>All of WhatsApp's text formatting options (Image: WhatsApp)</em></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[PlayStation account owners will soon be able to start using a passkey as an alternative to a password when logging into a PlayStation account on the web, in an app, or on a PlayStation device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/playstation-passkey.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937465" /><br/>
Passkey integration is <a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1760406409743593687">set to be introduced</a> at some point today, and users will be able to log in and authenticate their accounts with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, or a device passcode on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Passkeys are considered more convenient and secure than a traditional password, with sign-ins streamlined through biometric authentication. Passkeys are resistant to online attacks such as phishing because there's no password to steal and no one-time SMS code that can be intercepted.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has supported passkeys since 2022, and passkeys are available on iOS 16 and later, iPadOS 16 and later, and macOS Ventura and later.<br/>
<br/>
Many companies have been implementing support for passkeys, including Twitter, Google, PayPal, Best Buy, Microsoft, and eBay.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/passkeys/">Passkeys</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/playstation-passkeys-support/">PlayStation Adds Support for Passkeys as Password Alternative</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/playstation-adds-support-for-passkeys-as-password-alternative.2420098/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has frustrated another app developer with arbitrary enforcement of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules, with Insight Timer CEO Christopher Plowman this week <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christoplowman_two-weeks-ago-after-months-of-negotiations-activity-7165191328073519104-ubyo/">taking to LinkedIn</a> and speaking with <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/in-a-reversal-apple-is-now-demanding-30-of-the-donations-to-meditation-app-insight-timers-teachers/">TechCrunch</a></em> to complain about a frustrating experience with the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; review team.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
Insight Timer is a meditation app that is subscription based. Customers pay &#36;60 per year to access guided meditations, yoga classes, and other teacher-led courses. In addition to the subscription fee, Insight Timer accepts tips for teachers, which is what is at the heart of the dispute.<br/>
<br/>
In 2022, Insight Timer started allowing app users to provide their teachers with digital donations or tips, and these donations were not initially subject to Apple's 30 percent fee on digital goods per Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules. Apple approved 47 Insight Timer updates that had the tipping functionality, but late last year, Apple's review team decided that these payments weren't considered tips, but digital goods purchases, which subjected them to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in-app purchase fee.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase">App Store rule 3.2.1 vii</a> says that apps can allow users to give a gift to another individual without using in-app purchase, so long as the gift is an optional choice and 100 percent of the funds go to the receiver of the gift. This was the case with Insight Timer, as it was not taking a cut of tips, but the individual to individual wording is what became murky, as well as an addendum to that rule that says a gift "connected to or associated at any point in time with receiving digital content" requires in-app purchases.<br/>
<br/>
Apple took issue with Insight Timer accepting tips for live events and meditations, deciding that this money was for digital content. Plowman did not agree with Apple's assessment, and spent months negotiating. Apple did agree to allow tip links on teacher profile pages that are not subject to a 30 percent fee, but donations from live events and meditations are not considered tips. Apple's reasoning is that a one-to-one donation is a monetary gift, but a workshop or class with at least two people is digital content that's subject to a commission.<br/>
<br/>
Plowman suggested that the meditation and yoga experiences are no more digital than renting an Airbnb or taking an Uber, and Apple does not collect fees from these kinds of purchases.<br/>
<blockquote>Just as homeowners don't pay 30% of their Airbnb income to Apple - imagine the outrage - teachers shouldn't have to pay Apple 30% of their donation income either. Many Insight Timer teachers are doctors, nurses and educators who return home from their day jobs to work in the evenings on Insight Timer for critical supplemental income. They give up their personal time recording audio replies to classroom questions, responding to user reviews, hosting live events, writing music, creating guided meditations and leading discussion groups. There's nothing 'digital' about these experiences no matter how much the definition is contorted. The more teachers work, the more they earn. The correlation is obvious and the term 'digital content' simply does not apply.</blockquote><br/>
Of the &#36;60 subscription fee that customers pay, Apple collects 15 to 30 percent. The remainder is split between Insight Timer and the teachers that participate on the platform, with each getting a 50 percent cut. Insight Timer earned &#36;20 million in subscription revenue in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Apple required Insight Timer to comply with the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules to submit further app updates, with a February deadline. Insight Timer complied this week, submitting an update that eliminates the tipping feature except on teacher profiles. Plowman says that while he is frustrated, he believes Apple is willing to listen and that the company can be convinced to change. He asks that people share his story, but in a constructive manner. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> Apple says that while it originally approved the tipping feature attached to a user profile, tipping for live events and digital content was not enabled until August 2023. It was at that point that the Insight Timer update was rejected. While working with Insight Timer, Apple approved 17 app updates, and Insight Timer was told in November 2023 that the issue had to be fixed by February 2024. <br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, Insight Timer's latest update with the requested changes has been approved and no further action is required.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/insight-timer-ceo-app-store-dispute/">Insight Timer CEO Upset With Apple&#039;s Abrupt Enforcement of App Store Rules [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/insight-timer-ceo-upset-with-apples-abrupt-enforcement-of-app-store-rules-updated.2420092/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>FDA Warns Consumers Not to Use Smart Watches or Rings That Claim to Measure Blood Glucose Levels</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not want consumers to purchase or use smart watches or smart rings that claim to measure blood glucose levels using non-invasive methods. In <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/do-not-use-smartwatches-or-smart-rings-measure-blood-glucose-levels-fda-safety-communication">a safety warning shared today</a>, the FDA says that smart devices that claim to check blood sugar without piercing the skin can lead to errors in diabetes management, including taking too much or too little medication.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/Apple-Watch-Blood-Glucose-Monitoring-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-888310" /><br/>
No smart watch or smart ring that is intended to measure or estimate blood glucose values non-invasively has been authorized, cleared, or approved by the FDA. These non-invasive devices are different from continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) that relay data through a smart watch app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on a version of the Apple Watch that will be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/22/apple-blood-glucose-monitoring-technology/">measure blood glucose non-invasively</a>, but launch of such a device is still several years away. Apple has been exploring optical absorption spectroscopy using a laser to shine light under the skin to determine a person's blood glucose level, but as of 2023, Apple's work remained at a proof-of-concept stage.<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, there are several low-cost smart watches and smart rings that claim to be able to monitor glucose levels without a skin prick or without integrating with a CGM device. The FDA says patients should avoid such devices, and doctors should warn patients about the risks of using unauthorized blood glucose measuring products.<br/>
<blockquote>Sellers of these smartwatches and smart rings claim their devices measure blood glucose levels without requiring people to prick their finger or pierce the skin. They claim to use non-invasive techniques. These smartwatches and smart rings do not directly test blood glucose levels.<br/>
<br/>
These smartwatches and smart rings are manufactured by dozens of companies and sold under multiple brand names. This safety communication applies to any smartwatch or smart ring that claims to measure blood glucose without piercing the skin, regardless of manufacturer or brand.</blockquote><br/>
The FDA says that it is working to ensure that manufacturers, distributors, and sellers do not illegally market unauthorized smart watches or smart rings that claim to measure blood glucose levels.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple does end up releasing an Apple Watch that includes a sensor for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, Apple will need to get FDA approval before it is allowed to sell it in the U.S. Other companies like Samsung are working on similar technology, but there is no proven and approved non-invasive blood sugar monitoring method on the market as of right now.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fda/">FDA</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/fda-smart-watch-blood-sugar-warning/">FDA Warns Consumers Not to Use Smart Watches or Rings That Claim to Measure Blood Glucose Levels</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fda-warns-consumers-not-to-use-smart-watches-or-rings-that-claim-to-measure-blood-glucose-levels.2420089/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Astropad is launching a new version of the <a href="https://astropad.com/product/rock-paper-pencil/?sca_ref=5507981.N2my3G8kPZ">Rock Paper Pencil kit</a> that it came out with last summer, bringing some notable improvements that will allow for a better paper-like writing experience on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/rock-paper-pencil.jpg" alt="" width="3556" height="2000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937405" /><br/>
Rock Paper Pencil combines a screen protector and a unique <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> tip so that writing on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; feels like writing on a piece of paper. The new version of Rock Paper Pencil has a NanoCling Screen Protector that attaches to an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; using static cling rather than a magnetic edge like the prior version.<br/>
<br/>
Astropad says that NanoCling is stronger than magnets, and it provides a thinner bezel and a flatter surface on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The NanoCling Screen Protector is 40 percent thinner than the magnetic version, so there are no gaps or ridges to contend with. The screen protector continues to be easily removable and reusable so you can take it off when you're not writing, and it is not adhesive so it leaves no residue.<br/>
<br/>
The Pencil tip has also been redesigned to withstand heavy daily use. It has a wear-resistant copper alloy core and palladium coating, and it is able to hold up to more pressure. The Pencil tip has been slimmed down too, so it's equivalent to a standard 0.7mm ballpoint pen. The Rock Paper Pencil ships with two of the pencil tips and a protective storage sleeve for the screen protector.<br/>
<br/>
Rock Paper Pencil can be <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/rock-paper-pencil?sca_ref=5507981.N2my3G8kPZ">purchased from the Astropad website</a> for &#36;40. It is compatible with the 11-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, the third-generation 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and later, the seventh-generation 10.2-inch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and later, the 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and the sixth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/astropad/">Astropad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-2/">Astropad Launches Updated Rock Paper Pencil Kit for Realistic Writing Experience on iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/astropad-launches-updated-rock-paper-pencil-kit-for-realistic-writing-experience-on-ipad.2420079/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
