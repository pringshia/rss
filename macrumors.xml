		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to have enough upcoming product announcements to justify a full event this month, yet all signs indicate these reveals will be handled through a series of press releases instead.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Tim-Cook-Apple-Park.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="551" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-986877" /><br/>
There are a multitude of rumors from reliable sources about specific announcements in the coming weeks, so here's everything that Apple could have feasibly included in a hypothetical February event: <br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>iOS 18.4 preview (beta expected next week)</li><br/>
    <li>New <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> color option</li><br/>
    <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> (fourth generation)</li><br/>
    <li>Apple's first custom modem chip (debuting in &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;)</li><br/>
    <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> (11th generation, A17 Pro or A18)</li><br/>
    <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> (11- and 13-inch, M3 or M4)</li><br/>
    <li>Redesigned Magic Keyboard for &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;</li><br/>
    <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> (13- and 15-inch, M4)</li><br/>
    <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> (second-generation)</li><br/>
    <li>Vision Pro-related announcement (hardware refresh to add the M5 chip with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support, a price drop, a significant software update, or something else)</li><br/>
    <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">Apple Command Center</a> smart home hub preview (launch later in 2025)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/">recent social media teaser</a> for an Apple "launch" on February 19 is widely expected to relate to the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;. While the post confirms at least one product unveiling, it also suggests the company will not be holding a full-fledged event in the next few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Historically, Apple has used press releases to introduce products when the updates are more iterative, but the company has also hosted entire events for relatively modest announcements, such as the "Scary Fast" event in October 2023, which only saw the reveal of the M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> models. <br/>
<br/>
Several new devices are widely expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/what-to-expect-from-the-apple-launch-next-week/">announced soon</a>, including the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, the new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with the M4 chip, and updated &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> says that the M4 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; should launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/gurman-iphone-se-4-by-next-week/">within weeks</a>, while Apple's supply chain has been preparing for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-suppliers-prepping-for-new-macs-and-ipads/">arrival of new iPads</a>. Software references have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/m4-macbook-air-chip-identifiers/">already confirmed</a> the existence of many of these products, so launch is almost certainly right around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has occasionally held February events, but they are rare. In recent years, the company has preferred March for spring product announcements, as seen with the 2022 event that introduced the green <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 13, third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, and Studio Display. If Apple had opted for a February event this year, it would seemingly have had a more substantial series of announcements than some of its previous keynotes. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/15/things-apple-could-have-rolled-into-an-event/">10+ Announcements Apple Could Have Rolled Into a February Event</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/10-announcements-apple-could-have-rolled-into-a-february-event.2449431/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is in the middle of trickling out a variety of announcements including Powerbeats Pro 2 and an Apple TV+ app for Android phones this week, and based on a tease from Tim Cook it looks like there's at least one bigger announcement in store for next Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/top-stories-2025-02-15.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990139" /><br/>
While a new iPhone SE is the odds-on favorite for Wednesday's announcement, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/what-to-expect-from-the-apple-launch-next-week/">there are a few other products</a> we're expecting to see launch in the relatively near future, so we'll have to hang tight to see just how Apple plans to roll them out. Read on below for all the details on this week's biggest stories!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Tim Cook Teases an 'Apple Launch' Next Wednesday</h2><br/>
In a bit of an unusual move, Apple CEO Tim Cook has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/">teased an upcoming "launch" of some kind scheduled for Wednesday, February 19</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-launch-feb-2025.jpg.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989883" /><br/>
"Get ready to meet the newest member of the family," he said in a social media post, with an #AppleLaunch hashtag.<br/>
<br/>
Cook did not provide an exact time for the launch, or share any other specific details, so his post is a bit of a mystery. However, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman believes the post is a teaser for Apple announcing a new iPhone SE.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone SE 4 Launch is Imminent - What to Expect</h2><br/>
If next week's launch is indeed the next-generation iPhone SE, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/iphone-se-coming-wednesday-rumor-roundup/">we're expecting a host of upgrades</a> to modernize Apple's low-end iPhone, including Face ID, an A18 chip with Apple Intelligence support, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
Timing for a launch has been a bit unclear, with <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously claiming it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/09/gurman-new-iphone-se-this-week/">would be arriving this week</a> and a generic listing for it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/new-iphone-se-product-listing/">popping up on a French reseller's website</a>, but it now looks like things are lining up for a slightly later debut.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M4 MacBook Air Release Continues to Appear Imminent</h2><br/>
There continue to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/m4-macbook-air-chip-identifiers/">signs of a new MacBook Air with an M4 chip</a>, indicating that we could see the machine launch in the not too distant future. A reliable source this week shared the identifiers that the ‌MacBook Air‌ will use, and those identifiers correspond to the M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/m2-macbook-air-blue.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972561" /><br/>
Rumors have suggested that the M4 MacBook Air has been in production for months already, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/macos-sequoia-15-2-m4-macbook-air-leak/">Apple itself leaked references to it</a> in macOS Sequoia 15.2 back in December, but Apple has yet to officially announce it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Powerbeats Pro 2 Debut With Heart Rate Monitoring, H2 Chip, Active Noise Cancellation, and More</h2><br/>
Apple's Beats brand <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-announced/">officially introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 this week</a>, bringing significant updates to the wireless earphones aimed at active users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Powerbeats-Pro-2-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989403" /><br/>
Among the upgrades for Powerbeats Pro 2 are Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) with Transparency mode, Personalized Spatial Audio, an H2 chip for improved power efficiency and Apple ecosystem integration, and for the first time in an Apple audio product, Heart Rate Monitoring.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV+ App Now Available on Android</h2><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/apple-tv-app-android/">debuted a new Android smartphone app</a> on the Google Play store that will allow users on that platform to more easily subscribe to and watch Apple TV+ content, including MLS Season Pass.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-TV-App-Android.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989703" /><br/>
Android users can access Apple TV+ and MLS Season Pass by signing into their Apple Account, or subscribe directly through Google Play's billing system.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases iOS 18.3.1 With Bug Fixes</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/apple-releases-ios-18-3-1-with-bug-fixes/">released iOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1</a>, which offer bug fixes and security improvements including a fix for a vulnerability that "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/ios-18-3-1-vulnerability-fix/">may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack</a> against specific targeted individuals."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iOS-18.3.1-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988425" /><br/>
On devices that support Apple Intelligence, some users who previously turned off the feature have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-intelligence-re-enabled-in-latest-updates/">found it automatically turned back on</a> after updating, so be sure to double check your settings if you don't wish to use Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>World's Thinnest Foldable Phone Launches Next Week</h2><br/>
Apple has yet to enter the foldable smartphone market, but other manufacturers continue to press forward with their efforts and push the boundaries of what's physically possible.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/oppo-find-n5-fingers.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989071" /><br/>
Oppo has confirmed it will debut its Find N5 or OnePlus Open 2 foldable phone on February 20, with the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/worlds-thinnest-foldable-phone-launches-next-week/">reportedly measuring just 4mm thick when open</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/">teased an Apple announcement</a> that's coming on Wednesday, February 19, and it's looking like that mystery announcement will be the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
We've been hearing about the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 for quite some time now, and we essentially know everything to expect. If you want a sneak peek at what's coming, read on.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Naming</h2><br/>
Apple first introduced the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; in 2016, and the "SE" stands for Special Edition. Apple has used the SE naming for the last three models, but it's possible that's going to change this year.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors that the new low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/01/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-be-named-iphone-16e/">could be called</a> the "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6E" instead of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4, but the information came from a source without a well-established track record.<br/>
<br/>
The low-cost &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will have the same chip as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, along with a few other &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; features, so it would not be a shock for Apple to give it a new name to better tie it into current flagship models. When announcing the upcoming product launch, Cook also said "get ready to meet the newest member of the family," which could be a reference to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; family. At the same time, "family" could also just be the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; family.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design</h2><br/>
We're expecting the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; to have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14-style design, with a 6.1-inch display. Its launch will mark the end of smaller iPhones, and 6.1 inches will be the smallest screen size that Apple offers.<br/>
<br/>
While the current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is 4.7 inches, the size difference between the 4.7-inch model and the new 6.1-inch model isn't as extreme as you might think. The updated size will be noticeable, but getting rid of those thick bezels means there's a limited increase in physical size despite the larger display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iphone-se-4-mockups-bu-e1737971887187.jpg" alt="" width="6000" height="3375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987846" /><em><div class="center-wrap">An &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 dummy model</div></em><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is 5.45 inches tall and 2.65 inches wide with a thickness of 7.3mm, and the new model will be 5.78 inches tall, 2.82 inches wide, and a thickness of 7.8mm. Weight will increase just an ounce.<br/>
<br/>
Apple used to sell a 5.4-inch &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; "mini," but it was discontinued after the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 mini because it didn't sell well. In the future, Apple may appease those who want a small &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a clamshell device that folds in half, but rumors suggest that such a device is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">a year or more off</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to know what the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will look like, take a look at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>. It'll have the same general design with an all-display design, aluminum and glass build, mute switch, volume buttons, notch, power button, and 5G antenna/SIM tray. The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is expected to have a single-lens rear camera, though, rather than the dual-lens setup of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-14-Yellow-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887953" /><br/>
You likely saw early rumors about an Action Button or Camera Control button for the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 during the rumor cycle, but it sounds like those are not features that are coming to Apple's low-cost device after all. &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; dummy models have not included an Action button or a Camera Control button, nor have cases designed for the device.<br/>
<br/>
Both early &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cases and dummy models are often crafted based on supply chain leaks, and they're usually accurate because there's a good money in having a case ready to go right when a new device launches.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Display</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; introduced Ceramic Shield, which is stronger than typical smartphone glass and better able to hold up to drops and scratches, and it's likely the low-cost &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will adopt the Ceramic Shield material.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is updating the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; with an OLED display, which means the end of LCD display technology in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup when the current model is discontinued. LCDs are still used for some Macs and iPads, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup will be all OLED when the SE 4 launches. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/iphone-13-face-id-notch.jpg" alt="" width="1902" height="1070" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816362" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; had a notch to house the TrueDepth front-facing camera and facial recognition hardware, and the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will have the same notch design. There were rumors suggesting Apple could use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, but that's another feature that looks like it'll be reserved for the more expensive &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; options.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>No More Touch ID</h3><br/>
With an all-display design like the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, Apple is eliminating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>. When the current-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is discontinued in favor of the new model, there will be no &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; in the lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/iphone-se-7.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-841340" /><em><div class="center-wrap">The current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;</div></em><br/>
&zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; is still used for Macs and some iPads, but Apple will transition fully to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> for its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models with the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who prefer &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; to &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, but Apple is all-in on facial recognition, and it's more secure than &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj;. There's a less than <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/optic-face-touch-passcodes-passwords-sec9479035f1/web">1 in 1,000,000 chance</a> that a random person could unlock your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, but a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105095">1 in 50,000 chance</a> for &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Eliminating the &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; home button provides much more viewable screen space, which is a major bonus. Android manufacturers have married large display sizes with fingerprint recognition by putting sensors on the back of their smartphones, but Apple has never adopted that kind of design.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>No More Lightning</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will have a USB-C port for charging, with Apple continuing its mission to phase out the Lightning port.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is one of the last Apple devices that continues to use Lightning, and when Apple discontinues the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, which could happen with the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; launch, Lightning will be eliminated from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup. It's quite possible the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; will be discontinued when the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; launches because it makes little sense to keep a lower spec &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; around for &#36;599 when there's a more powerful &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; available that costs less.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>MagSafe</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; added support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a>, and since the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is using an &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; design, it will work with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories and will support &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; wireless charging. &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; is not an option for the current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, but &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging and &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories have become an increasingly important part of the Apple ecosystem over the last few years.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/magsafe-charger-early-black-friday.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974492" /><br/>
<h2>A18 Chip and 8GB RAM</h2><br/>
Apple plans to equip the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 with the same A18 chip that's in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, which means it's going to have flagship performance at a much more affordable price. The A18 chip will allow it to last for years to come, and it's going to be the most affordable way to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> in a smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/a18-chip.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965153" /><br/>
With the A18 chip, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features, and it's going to be a huge improvement over the A15 chip in the current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;. &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; requires 8GB RAM, so the new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will also have double the RAM of the current model.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Storage Space</h2><br/>
There's no concrete storage space rumor, but the rest of Apple's iPhones start with 128GB of storage, so it's quite possible we're going to see the end of the 64GB storage option this year. 64GB is simply not enough storage space, even for a low-cost &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Camera</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; could get the same 48-megapixel Wide lens that's in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, which will bring a major leap in photo quality compared to the 12-megapixel camera in the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-bu.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987257" /><em><div class="center-wrap">An &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; dummy model</div></em><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 won't have a Telephoto lens or an Ultra Wide lens, but if it does indeed use the same Wide lens, it will support next-generation portraits with focus and depth control, the newest photographic styles, and an option to crop in to 2x optical zoom.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Connectivity</h2><br/>
Apple is going to debut its new in-house modem in the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4, and it'll give us our first look at how Apple's modem technology compares to Qualcomm's modem technology.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/5G-Modem-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886940" /><br/>
Apple's modem chip won't support the fastest mmWave 5G speeds, but it will connect to the more widespread 6GHz 5G networks. Apple wants to cut down on its reliance on Qualcomm, and this new modem chip is the first step.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know how much Apple will promote the new modem, but expect to see a range of speed and performance comparisons where the new modem is pitted against Qualcomm's current &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; modem.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Emergency SOS via Satellite and Crash Detection</h3><br/>
This is speculation, but with the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, Apple added a Crash Detection feature that alerts emergency services if you're in a car accident. It's an important safety feature that's likely to be included in the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/iPhone-14-Emergency-SOS-via-Satellite-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-873507" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and later also support Emergency SOS via Satellite, and there's a good chance that'll be added to the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 too. Apple loves to promote its safety features, and they can be a major selling point, so we wouldn't be surprised to see both of these options.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Battery Life</h2><br/>
Rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will have the same battery as the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, which means it'll offer up to 20 hours of video playback, up to 16 hours of streaming video, and up to 80 hours of audio playback.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's quite a bit more space in a 6.1-inch device for a battery than there is in a 4.7-inch device, so it should come as no surprise that there will be a major improvement in overall battery life.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; offers 15 hours of video playback and up to 10 hours of streaming video playback.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Pricing</h2><br/>
With higher-end components, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 could be more expensive than the current model, but Apple is still aiming for a price point under &#36;500. The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3 is priced starting at &#36;429.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Apple-Logo-Cash-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-796910" /><br/>
<h2>No Event</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is an important new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in Apple's lineup, but it reuses components from the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, so it's not the most exciting device. Apple isn't going to hold an event to unveil the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4, instead introducing it through a press release and coverage on the Apple website.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Get ready to meet the newest member of the family.<br><br>Wednesday, February 19. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleLaunch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AppleLaunch</a> <a href="https://t.co/0ML0NfMedu">pic.twitter.com/0ML0NfMedu</a></p>&mdash; Tim Cook (@tim_cook) <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple did promote the launch early on social media, but without hints about just what product is coming on February 19.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Launch Date</h2><br/>
After being introduced on February 19, Apple will likely accept pre-orders for the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 before launching it a bit later in the month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/iphone-se-coming-wednesday-rumor-roundup/">Apple&#039;s Next iPhone SE Launching on Wednesday - Here&#039;s What We Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-next-iphone-se-launching-on-wednesday-heres-what-we-know.2449399/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Facebook parent company Meta is investing heavily in AI-powered humanoid robots, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/meta-plans-major-investment-into-ai-powered-humanoid-robots">Bloomberg</a></em>. Meta wants to create robots that can act like humans and help people with physical tasks, and has developed a new team in its Reality Labs hardware to work on the project.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-Robot-Emoji-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990175" /><br/>
Meta's first focus will be on robots that can do household chores, but the company's overarching goal is to develop AI, sensors, and software for robots that can be manufactured and sold to third-party companies to allow those companies to develop their own robots. Meta is aiming to be the Android of robots.<br/>
<br/>
Robot technology is not currently advanced enough to allow robots to fold clothes, do dishes, or complete other household chores, but Meta feels that its work in artificial intelligence and virtual reality could boost robot development.<br/>
<br/>
In 2025, Meta will spend around &#36;65 billion on artificial intelligence infrastructure, robotics, and virtual reality products. Meta plans to build some of its own hardware, and work with robotics manufacturers to build prototypes.<br/>
<br/>
If Meta does end up creating a humanoid robot, it could compete with an Apple-designed robot in the future. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/kuo-apple-robots-likely-2028-or-later/">is working on</a> both humanoid and non-humanoid robots, but the company's work on humanoid robotics is in the proof-of-concept stage and years away from launching.<br/>
<br/>
Non-humanoid robots could come sooner. Apple is said to be working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/">a tabletop robot</a> with an iPad-style display that's attached to a robotic arm, and such a product could come as early as 2026 or 2027.<br/>
<br/>
Apple robotics researchers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/apple-prototypes-tabletop-robot/">recently shared details</a> on a lamp-like robot prototype with lifelike movements and human-like interaction capabilities.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/meta-humanoid-robots-development/">Like Apple, Meta is Working on Humanoid Robots</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/like-apple-meta-is-working-on-humanoid-robots.2449398/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's smarter version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that incorporates <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features could end up being delayed, reports <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-s-long-promised-ai-overhaul-for-siri-runs-into-bugs-possible-delays"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple is running into engineering problems and software bugs that could push back the launch of the new functionality.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
Rumors suggested that Apple planned to introduce the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features in iOS 18.4, but the first iOS 18.4 beta is expected as soon as next week, and it appears &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; won't be ready in time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already promised that &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; will be available in new languages in April, suggesting that's when the iOS 18.4 update will launch, so Apple has a limited amount of time to get &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; ready to go. Some features may now need to be postponed until May later, with Apple perhaps planning to introduce them in an iOS 18.5 update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has promised three &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, including personal context to better understand and respond to requests, the ability to do more in and between apps, and on-screen awareness to respond to requests that involve content the user is looking at. Employees testing the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features have reportedly said that they are not yet working consistently.<br/>
<br/>
Major new features rarely come as late as May, because Apple typically transitions to working on the next-generation version of iOS in June after WWDC.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says that Apple could still debut the features in iOS 18.4, but turn them off by default as testing continues until iOS 18.5, and in that case, we'd still see the new functionality in iOS 18.4. We should be getting the first iOS 18.4 beta soon, though it is not likely that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be in the initial beta given today's report. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/apple-intelligence-siri-overhaul-could-get-delayed/">Apple Intelligence Siri Overhaul Could Get Delayed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-siri-overhaul-could-get-delayed.2449396/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that it will soon be opening a <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/downtowndetroit/">new retail store in Downtown Detroit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Apple-Store-App-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886114" /><br/>
At this time, the store page on Apple's website does not provide any further details, including an exact location or grand opening date.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does mention that the Downtown Detroit store is <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?location=michigan-state972&team=sales-APPST-ARSS+support-APPST-ARSCS+leadership-APPST-ARSLD">now hiring</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/new-apple-stores-planned-in-detroit-miami-more/">reported</a> that the Downtown Detroit store will be located on the 1400 block of Woodward Avenue, and construction was already underway.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already has three stores in the Detroit area, but this would be the first location serving the city's downtown core, which has been experiencing a revival in recent years. The store could also serve customers from nearby Windsor, Ontario in Canada.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple launched the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> 19 years ago today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/original-macbook-pro-2006.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-984873" /><br/>
Jobs <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/01/10Apple-Introduces-MacBook-Pro/">announced</a> the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; at the Macworld Conference & Expo in 2006. It was the first Mac notebook to transition from PowerPC processors to Intel's Core Duo architecture. Designed to be an Intel-based replacement for the PowerBook line, the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; took a similar aluminum chassis and added an Intel Core processor, a webcam, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> power connector. Its display was 67% brighter than its predecessor, matching the luminance of Apple's standalone Cinema Displays.<br/>
<br/>
Apple claimed that the Intel processors delivered "up to four times the performance of the PowerBook G4." The transition was supported by Rosetta, a software translation layer that allowed PowerPC applications to run on Intel-based Macs.<br/>
<br/>
The original &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; came in two configurations, both with 15.4-inch widescreen displays offering 1440 x 900 resolution. The entry-level model featured a 1.67 GHz Intel Core Duo processor, 512MB of DDR2 RAM, and an 80GB hard drive, while the higher-end model boasted a 1.83 GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and a 100GB hard drive. Both models included ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics cards. The 15-inch model weighed just 5.6 pounds and was only one inch thick.<br/>
<br/>
It also featured two USB 2.0 ports, a FireWire 400 port, a Gigabit Ethernet port, and an ExpressCard/34 slot for expandability. The exclusion of FireWire 800 in the initial 15-inch models drew criticism from some users, but this port was later restored in subsequent revisions. Initially only available with a 15-inch display, Apple introduced a 17-inch variant in April 2006.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; line evolved through various design and technological iterations, including the unibody construction in 2008, the Retina display in 2012, and the controversial Touch Bar in 2016. The transition from Intel to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a> in 2020 marked the end of the Intel-based &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; era, as Apple moved to its proprietary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/">M1 Max</a> chips.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/apple-launched-macbook-pro-19-years-ago/">Apple Launched the MacBook Pro 19 Years Ago Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launched-the-macbook-pro-19-years-ago-today.2449392/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier today, some Netflix users in the United States began seeing Netflix content in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app's Continue Watching queue, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/netflix-shows-in-apple-tv-app-for-some-users/">which prompted speculation</a> that Netflix was rolling out &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; integration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884792" /><br/>
As it turns out, Netflix content showing up in new places in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; interface was a bug, and Netflix is not introducing expanded &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; functionality. In a statement to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613307/netflix-apple-tv-app-support-mistake">The Verge</a></em>, a Netflix spokesperson confirmed that temporary support for the Continue Watching feature was an error, and it has been rolled back.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix is one of the only major streaming services that has refused to offer integration with the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app, preferring instead for customers to manage watch lists and browse for content directly in the Netflix app.<br/>

Netflix has never supported integration with the built-in content tracking feature in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app, so &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; users are not able to see Netflix shows and movies in their watchlists. Content from &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+, Hulu, Disney+, Max, Amazon Prime Video, and other services can be tracked with the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app across Apple devices, but that is not the case for Netflix.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/netflix-no-apple-tv-integration/">Netflix Isn&#039;t Adding Apple TV Integration After All</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-isnt-adding-apple-tv-integration-after-all.2449388/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Instagram is testing a "dislike" button that can be used for comments, Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DGD12NZPjwb">confirmed today</a>. The dislike button is designed to give people a "private" way to signal that they don't feel good about a particular comment.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Instagram-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786417" /><br/>
Mosseri says that the feature is just a test at the current time, but the goal is to help "make comments more friendly." If the test goes well, the dislike signal could be integrated into comment ranking to move disliked comments lower down in the comment section of an Instagram post or reel.<br/>
<br/>
There is no dislike count for posts, nor can the post creator or other commenters see if a user has disliked a post. Dislikes are an internal signal hidden from users. In a statement to <em>TechCrunch</em>, an Instagram spokesperson said the company is testing the feature with a small number of users.<br/>
<blockquote>We're working on ways to help people better control their Instagram experience and what they're seeing on the app. We're testing a new button next to each comment on a Reel or Feed post for people to privately signal they don't feel good about that particular comment or find it relevant. We're testing this with a very small group of people to start. Later, we may also test moving these comments lower down in the comments section to help create a better experience.</blockquote><br/>
Users who have access to the dislike feature will see a downward pointing arrow available to tap, which is similar to the downvote feature that Reddit uses.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/instagram-comment-dislike-button/">Instagram Tests New Dislike Button for Comments</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-tests-new-dislike-button-for-comments.2449386/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/apple-launch-set-for-february-19th-new-products-on-the-way/id1602394741?i=1000692269934">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss the imminent Apple product "launch" that is widely expected to be the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJ2kVhQUX3o?si=Pmw5nofTNFuzfWpd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
In a social media post on Thursday, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/">teased an upcoming "launch"</a> of some kind scheduled for Wednesday, February 19. "Get ready to meet the newest member of the family," he said, with an #AppleLaunch hashtag. The post includes a short video with an animated Apple logo inside a circle.<br/>
<br/>
We analyze the possibilities for the announcement and why it's most likely to be a new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, with rumored features including the A18 chip, a larger 6.1-inch OLED display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, a USB-C port, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support, and more. The launch of other new devices, such as the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/m4-macbook-air-chip-identifiers/">appear to be</a> right around the corner. <br/>
<br/>
We also discuss Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2 earphones, which tout Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) with Transparency mode, Personalized Spatial Audio, an H2 chip for improved power efficiency and Apple ecosystem integration, and Heart Rate Monitoring–a first time for an Apple audio product. We talk through the utility of the heart rate monitoring feature, fit, and how they compare to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is likely to sell over 20 million <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> 4 units this year, making it the most popular &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; model ever, according to Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-SE-4-Blue-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-990157" /><br/>
In a new <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1890443592545743356?s=46">post on X</a>, Kuo said that the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is expected to see shipments of approximately 12 million in the first half of 2025 and 10 million in the second half of 2025–which is apparently better than previous &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
The new device will reportedly reduce the impact of lower <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> shipments at this time of year, as well as "accelerate the penetration of models that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>."<br/>
<br/>
Kuo also noted that the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;'s custom modem may be the source of patent litigation from Qualcomm. The company apparently believes it may be able to obtain part of the patent licensing fees from Apple's custom modem to reduce losses from cancelled component orders.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is expected to debut as soon as next week, featuring the A18 chip, a larger 6.1-inch OLED display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, a USB-C port, &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; support, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/iphone-se-likely-to-become-more-popular/">iPhone SE Likely to Become More Popular Than Ever</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-likely-to-become-more-popular-than-ever.2449380/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon this week updated its <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-prime-video/id545519333">Prime Video app</a> for the Apple TV with several improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Amazon-Prime-Video-Apple-TV.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990147" /><br/>
According <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612513/amazon-prime-video-apple-tv-app-update">to <em>The Verge</em></a>, the app is now better optimized for the tvOS platform. You can now use the Siri Remote to swipe through TV shows and movies, and touchpad gestures for fast forwarding and rewinding content are now supported.<br/>
<br/>
Suggested search results now appear as you type, and you can search with the Siri Remote.<br/>
<br/>
The app now shows higher-resolution imagery, and there are new motion and sound effects.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Amazon-Prime-Video-Apple-TV-Playback-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990148" /><br/>
Last, the app now supports the Apple accessibility features VoiceOver, Hover Text, and Bold Text.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, the app now provides a more "native" experience on tvOS.<br/>
<br/>
You can download the Prime Video app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-prime-video/id545519333">from the App Store</a> for free, but you will need a Prime subscription to stream content. The latest version of the app is compatible with all Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon-prime-video/">Amazon Prime Video</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/revamped-prime-video-app-for-apple-tv/">Amazon Revamps Prime Video App on Apple TV — Here&#039;s What&#039;s New</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amazon-revamps-prime-video-app-on-apple-tv-—-heres-whats-new.2449374/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple may have a fight on its hands in the 27-inch 5K display space. Recently we've seen a solid budget competitor to the &#36;1,600+ Apple Studio Display arrive on the market with the &#36;799 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/asus-proart-5k-display/">ASUS ProArt 5K Display</a>, and now here we have the <a href="https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/professional/pd2730s.html">BenQ PD2730S</a>, part of the company's Designer Series that promises "always accurate and consistent colors." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730s-studio-display.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990127" /><br/>
Price-wise, this monitor sits &#36;400 either side of the Apple and ASUS offerings at &#36;1,200. As you'd expect, it packs more features than the cheaper ASUS display. For a start, it's Thunderbolt 4. But the extra capabilities don't end there. I've spent several weeks with it, putting it through its paces alongside an Apple Studio Display. So how did it fare?<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Key Display Specifications</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li><strong>Panel Type:</strong> 27-inch IPS with Nano Matte coating</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 5120 x 2880 (5K)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> 400 nits peak</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Contrast Ratio:</strong> 2000:1 (IPS Black technology)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Color Gamut:</strong> 98% P3, 100% sRGB</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Refresh Rate:</strong> 60Hz</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Response Time:</strong> 5ms (GtG)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>HDR Support:</strong> VESA DisplayHDR 400</li><br/>
    <li><strong>VESA Mount:</strong> 100 x 100mm</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Built-in Speakers:</strong> 2x 3W stereo</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Included Accessories:</strong> HotKey Puck G3 wireless controller</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Design and Build Quality</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730S-8.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990115" /><br/>
First off, the PD2730S doesn't match Apple's all-aluminum aesthetic. Let's be honest, nothing on the market quite does. But BenQ has remained faithful to the same design ethos that was evident in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/review-benq-ma270u-4k-mac-monitor/">MA270U 4K monitor review</a>. While it may not be to everyone's taste, it's tried and tested. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730s-x-e1739546575168.jpg" alt="" width="3905" height="2974" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990116" /><br/>
The monitor combines black, white, and silver elements into a cohesive whole. The black bezels remain pleasantly slim, the rear of the display is a white plastic that curves outwards slightly, and the silver stand is a brushed metal pipe about 2.5 inches in diameter. Assembly is extremely simple and requires no tools. You just click the neck of the stand to the back and then use the key-screw to fasten on the rectangular base.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730S-14-e1739545228563.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990117" /><br/>
Once set up, the monitor feels remarkably solid, and the stand deserves special mention - it's a robust piece of engineering that provides great stability. I particularly like how the display panel remains steady even when adjusting its position, something that's surprisingly rare in this price range.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of adjustments, BenQ hasn't skimped here. The stand offers a comprehensive range of movement: height adjustment up to 150mm, -5° to 20° tilt, and smooth 60° swivel capabilities. This versatility comes as standard - no &#36;400 upgrade required, Apple. For those preferring alternative mounting solutions, there's a standard VESA mount option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Connectivity and Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730S-5.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990118" /><br/>
Connectivity is where the PD2730S really shines. The monitor boasts a genuinely useful selection of ports. The Thunderbolt 4 input delivers 90W of power delivery, which is enough for my 14-inch MacBook Pro. You'll also find HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, and a downstream Thunderbolt 4 port supporting display daisy-chaining. These ports face outward rather than downward - a small detail that makes a big difference in daily use.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730S-7.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990119" /><br/>
A thoughtful array of USB ports rounds out the package. There's both USB-C (2x) and USB-A (3x) connectivity, making this an effective hub for any desk setup. That said, most of these are located directly under the panel next to a headphone jack and they face downwards, so the dangling cables can look a bit messy if you use them all. On the other hand, BenQ includes a hook that attaches to the stand behind the monitor for funnelling cables through, which is a much more aesthetically pleasing cable management system than the one found on the ASUS ProArt 5K Display.<br/>
<br/>
Another point worth noting is that the hub can provide power even when the display is off, so you can keep your MacBook and whatever else plugged in and charging regardless.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730S-13.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990120" /><br/>
BenQ also includes its unique HotKey Puck G3 controller. This wireless dial provides quick access to display settings and input switching. It's customizable and works well, and creative professionals might appreciate it, but it's not something I've found myself using regularly. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Display Performance</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730S-2.jpg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990122" /><br/>
Let's get down to brass tacks: image quality. The IPS panel delivers outstanding clarity. Text on the panel appears razor-sharp, and images pop with vivid detail. With 5120x2880 resolution, you're getting the same pixel density as Apple's Studio Display. And just like the Apple Studio Display, you get 218 pixels per inch, ensuring that sweet spot for 5K Retina.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730S-1.jpg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990121" /><br/>
Likewise, color accuracy impresses right out of the box. The monitor covers 98% of the P3 color gamut, which is crucial for creative work. BenQ's factory calibration proved spot-on as far as I'm concerned, although you can fine-tune things further using the included software tools. Display ColorTalk lets you easily match colors between a MacBook and the monitor or between two monitors – no calibrator needed – while Palette Master Ultimate lets you achieve more precise color matching using a calibrator.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-calibration-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="2397" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990132" /><br/>
The panel employs BenQ's Nano Matte coating, which effectively manages reflections without compromising image clarity. The panel's maximum brightness reaches 400 nits, which is less than the Studio Display's 600 nits. This is the one visually noticeable difference between the two panels, but I've found 400 nits to be perfectly adequate for my environment. It's worth noting that the panel is "only" 60Hz. That may irk hard-core gamers, but I had no problems playing Resident Evil 2, and it's totally adequate for everyday tasks and image editing work. Lastly, the PD2730S has 2000:1 contrast ratio, providing a solid dynamic range.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Software Integration</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/display-pilot-puck-benq.jpg" alt="" width="2662" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990123" /><br/>
We covered BenQ's Display Pilot 2 software in the MA270U review, but it deserves special mention. It enables seamless brightness and volume control using your Mac's keyboard - a feature that's surprisingly rare in third-party monitors. The software also provides straightforward access to color profiles and monitor settings. ICCsync ensures consistent color matching between your MacBook and external display, and while HDR support is limited to HDR400, it's there if you need it. The KVM switch functionality should also prove handy when working with multiple computers. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730S-11.jpg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990125" /><br/>
All that being said, you don't have to use the software to control the monitor, since you can access all of the settings in the OSD menu via the physical controls along the bottom of the display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Summing Up</h2><br/>
The BenQ PD2730S makes a compelling case for itself. At &#36;1,199, it delivers 5K resolution, excellent color accuracy, Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, and other thoughtful features at a significantly lower price point than Apple's Studio Display. Yes, the speakers are terrible, but that seems par for the course in third-party monitors. And no, it doesn't have a webcam like the Studio Display, but that just means you can invest in a better one than the latter offers. While the PD2730S can't match Apple's premium build quality or 600-nit brightness, it compensates with superior ergonomics and connectivity options.<br/>
<br/>
This monitor deserves serious consideration by creative professionals seeking a high-resolution display without breaking the bank. It strikes an impressive balance between performance and value, offering most of what makes the Studio Display great at a more accessible price point.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Where to Buy</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/benq-pd2730s.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989861" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix appears to have softened its stance on Apple TV integration, with some users in the US now reporting seeing prompts to connect their Netflix accounts directly to Apple's TV app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/netflix-apple-tv-app.jpeg" alt="" width="2400" height="1313" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990099" /><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1739529080">FlatpanelsHD</a></em> was first to spot the reports. The change means users can add Netflix Originals to their TV app watchlist. After accepting the integration prompt, these shows appear in the "Continue Watching" queue.<br/>
<br/>
The integration currently seems restricted to Netflix Original content rather than the service's full catalog of licensed shows and movies. When users select content to watch, they are still directed to the Netflix app for playback.<br/>
<br/>
Historically, Netflix has refused integration with Apple's TV app ecosystem. Before now, Netflix users had to use the company's standalone app exclusively.<br/>
<br/>
The feature appears limited to the US at this time, as users with non-US Apple IDs are not seeing the integration option. It's worth noting that the functionality is limited to Apple TV set-top boxes, since there are no reports of the connect prompt appearing in the Apple TV app on iPhones, iPads, or third-party devices like smart TVs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Am I dreaming? Netflix integration in the Apple TV app? <a href="https://t.co/yMeWk6x2US">pic.twitter.com/yMeWk6x2US</a></p>&mdash; FlatpanelsHD (@Flatpanels) <a href="https://twitter.com/Flatpanels/status/1890342210672935164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Neither Apple nor Netflix has made an official announcement about the integration, and it remains unclear whether this is part of a test or the beginning of a broader rollout. As always, watch this space.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> Netflix says that Netflix content appearing in the Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/netflix-no-apple-tv-integration/">was a bug</a>, and it has since been addressed.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working to bring its AI features to China as early as May, with Alibaba and Baidu acting as local partners to help the company meet strict state regulations, according to a new <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-plans-to-overhaul-china-iphones-with-ai-by-middle-of-year">Bloomberg</a></em> report. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-iPhone-16.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964551" /><br/>
Apple is said to have dedicated teams in both China and the US working to adapt its Apple Intelligence platform for the Chinese market, as it navigates the country's complex regulatory system. <br/>
<br/>
Alibaba is Apple's primary partner in the endeavor, with the e-commerce giant reportedly building an on-device system to analyze and modify Apple's AI models for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users in China. The system will include built-in censorship and filtering capabilities to comply with Chinese government requirements. Meanwhile, Baidu will act as a secondary partner, handling features like Visual Intelligence for the upcoming iPhone 16.<br/>
<br/>
The Chinese version of Apple Intelligence will differ significantly from the one featured on US Apple devices. The US version combines on-device features, server-based processing (<a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/">Private Cloud Compute</a>), and ChatGPT integration. In contrast, the Chinese version will rely heavily on local partnerships. Alibaba's software will basically be an intermediary layer that allows government-directed content filtering without the user knowing it.<br/>
<br/>
The AI features that result from the partnership will only be available on Apple devices sold within China, while devices purchased elsewhere and brought into the country won't have access to the local AI system. Apple has reportedly submitted materials to Chinese authorities for approval, but it still faces some regulatory hurdles before the features can be launched.<br/>
<br/>
The combined effort comes as Apple faces declining sales in China, its largest market outside the US, where local smartphone brands have gained market share partly thanks to their AI offerings.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/apple-intelligence-plan-for-china-report/">Apple Intelligence Plan for China Detailed in New Report</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-plan-for-china-detailed-in-new-report.2449364/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp has <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/chat-themes-to-reflect-your-style">announced</a> the introduction of chat themes, giving users the freedom to personalize their conversations using custom colors for both chat bubbles and backgrounds. The encrypted messaging platform is also adding 30 new wallpaper options to help users further customize their chat experience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/whatsapp-chat-themes.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990085" /><br/>
The new customization options let you either choose from preset themes that modify both chat bubbles and backgrounds simultaneously, or mix and match colors to create your own unique combinations. <br/>
<br/>
You can apply a unified theme across all your conversations and channels, but the new options mean you also have the flexibility to customize individual chats with different themes. WhatsApp notes that these customizations are visible only to the user who sets them, so personal preferences won't affect other people in the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
To set a default theme for all chats, navigate to Settings ➝ Chats ➝ Default chat theme. For individual chat customization, simply tap the chat name at the top of the screen. The new theme options are currently rolling out and will become available to all WhatsApp users over the next few weeks. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/whatsapp-rolls-out-chat-themes-colorful-bubbles/">WhatsApp Rolls Out Customizable Chat Themes and Colorful Bubbles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-rolls-out-customizable-chat-themes-and-colorful-bubbles.2449362/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 17 Air Could Look Like This in Real Life</title>

		<description><![CDATA[There have been several alleged leaked details of the iPhone 17 Air, Apple's rumored new slim iPhone, but images have been limited to grainy shots taken in component factories. However, this hyper-realistic concept created by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF5HXJItzsx">WEIS Studio</a> gives us the best idea yet of what Apple's thin device might actually look like.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-air-concept-weis.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990078" /><br/>
The concept design is inspired by recent leaks indicating that the device will have a super-slim 5.5mm profile. For comparison, the iPhone 16 Pro measures 8.25mm in thickness, while the 11-inch M4 iPad Pro comes in at 5.3mm. That measurement doesn't include the camera bump, which could be thicker to accommodate the single 48-megapixel rear camera rumored for the device.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of size, rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display, which will put it in between the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max in size. As mentioned, it will have a single-lens rear camera, and Apple could be planning for a horizontal bar-like camera bump at the back. <br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 17 Air is rumored to come with a 120Hz ProMotion display and Apple's in-house 5G modem. It's also expected to feature the A19 chip, Wi-Fi 7, and a more durable display material designed to resist drops and scratches. <br/>
<br/>
Unlike the iPhone 17 Pro models, which prioritize high-end hardware, Apple is reportedly positioning the iPhone 17 Air as a design-focused device. While it may not have the most advanced internal components, its refreshed aesthetic could be a major selling point.<br/>

There's no word on battery life for the iPhone 17 Air yet, but space will be limited so there may be battery life compromises. The device is expected to be priced more affordably than the iPhone 17 Pro, which will start at &#36;999. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation iPhone 17 Pro will feature three rear cameras arranged in a familiar triangular layout, but the cameras will be housed in an all-new rectangular camera bar with rounded corners, according to YouTube channel Front Page Tech.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-17-Pro-Render-Front-Page-Tech.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990064" /><em>iPhone 17 Pro camera design render created by <a href="https://x.com/asherdipps">Asher</a> for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FrontPageTech/">Front Page Tech</a></em></div><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08JoSCHV9VY">video uploaded today</a>, Front Page Tech host Jon Prosser said the camera bar will be considerably larger than many earlier concepts circulating online have showed. The camera lenses are positioned on the left side of the bar, while an LED flash, a rear microphone, and the LiDAR Scanner are lined up vertically on the right side.<br/>
<br/>
Prosser said the iPhone 17 Pro features a two-tone finish, with the camera bar appearing to be darker than the rest of the rear shell.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if this alleged design change has any benefits, or if it is purely for aesthetics.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/08JoSCHV9VY?si=Sa-wZzIaZTCW6CK0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Prosser said his information is based on multiple sources familiar with the iPhone 17 Pro's design, and he said that he has seen the device himself.<br/>
<br/>
The redesigned camera array would presumably extend to the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but Prosser did not confirm that. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/alleged-iphone-17-air-shell/">ultra-thin "iPhone 17 Air" is also rumored to feature a rear camera bar</a>, but with only a single camera. It is not clear if the camera bar will extend to the lowest-end iPhone 17 model, but it seems likely for consistency.<br/>
<br/>
Google's Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro also have a rear camera bar, but the lenses are arranged in a horizontal line rather than triangularly.<br/>
<br/>
Prosser has been a well-known tech YouTuber for more than a decade. Like most sources, he has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">mixed track record</a> with Apple rumors, with  some hits and some misses. In 2020, he was the first source to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/14/prosser-airtags-design-likely-announced-tomorrow/">reveal the design of the AirTag</a>, many months before it was announced. He also shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/">many accurate details about the iPad mini 6</a>, months before that device was announced. On the other hand, he and others were wrong about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/">Apple Watch Series 7 having flat edges</a>, although perhaps Apple tested such a design.<br/>
<br/>
Prosser recently claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">iOS 19 will introduce a redesigned Camera app</a> with a visionOS-like design, including translucent menus and buttons.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 series in September, and additional design-related rumors will likely surface before then.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-camera-design-leak/">iPhone 17 Pro With All-New Camera Bar Design Allegedly Revealed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-with-all-new-camera-bar-design-allegedly-revealed.2449343/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[TikTok is once again available for download from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, which means it can be installed on iPhones and will be able to receive updates. Apple's decision to start distributing TikTok again comes after a letter sent from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter">Bloomberg</a></em>, but the letter has not been shared. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/18/apple-removes-tiktok-from-app-store-in-us/">removed TikTok</a> from the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; on January 18, just ahead of when a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-january-19-ban-imminent/">law banning TikTok</a> went into effect on January 19.<br/>
<br/>
The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act that led to TikTok being removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/tiktok-sues-us-government/">first passed in April 2024</a>, and it gave TikTok parent company ByteDance a nine month period to sell the app to a non-Chinese company.<br/>
<br/>
ByteDance fought against the law, claiming that it was unconstitutional and violated the First Amendment, but U.S. courts, including the Supreme Court, were not swayed by the argument.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. President Donald Trump gave TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Department of Justice not to enforce the law for a 90-day period, but Apple did not return the app to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. In a support document explaining TikTok's removal, Apple said that it is "obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates."<br/>
<br/>
Even with the DoJ not technically enforcing the law, it is still a law, and Apple was likely concerned about facing future penalties. Nothing has changed with TikTok as of yet, and the law continues to be in place, but the DoJ has tried to assure Apple that it will not face consequences for allowing TikTok downloads. Apple appears to have been persuaded. <br/>
<br/>
While TikTok has been absent from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; for the last month, the social network has remained functional and those who previously downloaded TikTok have been able to continue to use the app. <br/>
<br/>
The Trump administration is attempting to work out a deal that would see TikTok sold to a U.S. buyer, and Vice President J.D. Vance has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-taps-vance-negotiate-sale-tiktok-ahead-deadline-rcna191185">reportedly been tasked</a> with securing a deal. The Chinese government has maintained that it will not allow TikTok to be sold, which complicates the matter, plus Trump has recently levied an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/tiktok-coming-back-to-apples-app-store-tonight/">TikTok Returns to Apple&#039;s App Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-returns-to-apples-app-store.2449339/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
