Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/">tech specs</a> for the laptops indicate that all of the latest 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models provide up to 600 nits of peak brightness for SDR content, which is a 20% increase over the 500 nits maximum on the previous models. For HDR content, all of the models can achieve peak brightness of up to 1,600 nits, which is unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
"The Liquid Retina XDR display is the world's best laptop display, with an exceptional 1000 nits sustained and 1600 nits of peak brightness for HDR content, impressive contrast ratio, vivid colors, and an outstanding viewing angle," said Apple. "SDR content is now displayed at up to 600 nits, which is 20 percent brighter than before."<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are available to order starting today, and they will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7.

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919526" /><br/>
The highest-end 16-inch MacBook Pro has a base cost of &#36;4,000 with 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 48GB Unified memory, and 1TB SSD. Fully upgrading the memory costs &#36;1,000, while opting for an 8TB SSD adds another &#36;2,200. The 14-inch MacBook Pro can be purchased with the same upgraded specs for &#36;6,899.<br/>
<br/>
128GB Unified Memory is only available with the M3 Max chip. The M3 chip is limited to 24GB Unified Memory like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, while the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro supports up to 36GB Unified Memory.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> has been updated with the new M3 chip that offers notable speed improvements over the prior <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>, but as it has not been refreshed since 2021, there are also a few other new features. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-M3-Blue-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917291" /><br/>
The machine's design has not been updated, and it comes in the same colors, but the more advanced M3 chip allows the 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; to be outfitted with up to 24GB Unified Memory, up from the 16GB maximum in the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; version.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also added Wi-Fi 6E support to allow the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; to connect to 6GHz networks, and it supports the Bluetooth 5.3 protocol for improved connectivity and range. <br/>
<br/>
The M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; still comes in two-port and four-port varieties with the latter featuring an extra two USB 3 ports. The two-port model has an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, while the four-port model has an 8-core GPU and 10-core GPU. The version with more ports also supports up to 2TB of storage, while the two-port model is limited to 1TB.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,299 for the two Thunderbolt port model, while the model with two Thunderbolt ports and two USB 3 ports is priced starting at &#36;1,499. Apple is accepting orders today, with the new machines set to arrive to customers next week. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/imac-max-memory-wi-fi-6e/">M3 iMac Gains More Maximum Memory, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-imac-gains-more-maximum-memory-wi-fi-6e-and-bluetooth-5-3.2409269/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips last for up to 18 hours when watching moves with the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app or up to 12 hours when browsing the web. The M3 Pro and M3 Max 14-inch models come with a slightly larger 72.4-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery.<br/>

Accordingly, Apple has released its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUVQ3AM/A/usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-2-m-space-black">USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable in Space Black</a> for &#36;49.<br/>

Apple already includes a color-matched MagSafe 3 charging cable in the box with the new MacBook Pro models, but the cable can be ordered individually from Apple's online store for those who want an extra one or need a replacement. The cable also remains available in Space Gray, Midnight, Starlight, and Silver.<br/>
<br/>
The cable is also compatible with 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M2 chip.<br/>
<br/>
MagSafe technology allows the cable to magnetically attach to a MacBook. If someone trips on the cable, it releases so that the MacBook does not go tumbling. The cable is two meters long and features a woven design for added durability.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-space-black/">Apple&#039;s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable Now Available to Order in Space Black</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-now-available-to-order-in-space-black.2409262/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-imac-with-m3-chip/">newly announced</a> M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> is still accompanied by peripherals with a Lightning port for pairing and charging, rather than USB-C as rumored.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-imac-whats-in-the-box.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919481" /><br/>
In recent months, Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">widely expected</a> to be planning to switch the Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse to USB-C upon the release of the M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, but that has not occurred. These peripherals continue to feature a Lightning port and are completely unchanged following Apple's series of Mac-related announcements. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to leave the accessories unchanged is notable because the company has otherwise progressively been moving to USB-C. The entire <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, all latest-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Remote for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, and new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> all now feature a USB-C port. Other than the three peripherals that accompany the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, the only latest-generation Apple devices that still have a Lightning port are the AirPods, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lightning/">Lightning</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-mouse/">Magic Mouse</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/">Magic Keyboard</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-trackpad/">Magic Trackpad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/magic-accessories-still-feature-lightning/">Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse Still Feature Lightning Instead of USB-C</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magic-keyboard-magic-trackpad-and-magic-mouse-still-feature-lightning-instead-of-usb-c.2409261/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of the new M3 14-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is no longer listed for sale through Apple's store, with the MacBook Pro section offering only 14-inch and 16-inch models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/13-inch-macbook-pro-2022-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1100" height="619" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850662" /><br/>
The 13-inch MacBook Pro was the last Mac with a Touch Bar, so the sunsetting of the 13-inch MacBook Pro also means that the Touch Bar has been officially discontinued.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> MacBook Pro was priced at &#36;1,299, making it &#36;100 more expensive than the very similar 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the new M3 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,599, which means the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is the only option for those looking for a more affordable notebook at the current time.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch MacBook Pro will still be available from Apple's refurbished store and from retailers until supplies run out.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/">MacBook Pro 13"</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13">13" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">Apple Discontinues 13-Inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro-with-touch-bar.2409256/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-supercharges-24-inch-imac-with-new-m3-chip/">announced</a> an updated version of the 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> featuring the all-new M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="902" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919460" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with M3 is up to 2x faster than the previous &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, which featured the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. For those upgrading from an Intel based &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, Apple says that the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is up to 2.5x faster than previous 27-inch models and 4.5x faster than previous 21.5-inch models.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; now supports up to 24GB of memory and the M3 chip's all-new GPU brings hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing to the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
The new machine also features Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. It continues to be available in the same green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and silver color options as the previous model, but it comes with new color-matched wallpapers.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; starts at the same &#36;1,299 price of the previous model.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple at its "Scary Fast" October event has announced a new dark aluminum <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">Space Black</a> color for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">M3 Pro and M3 Max chips</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
Apple calls the new MacBook Pro in Space Black, "a gorgeous dark aluminum finish, with a breakthrough anodization method that resists fingerprints." The enclosure is created from a custom alloy that uses 100% recycled aluminum and is described as "very durable."<br/>
<br/>
M3 Pro and M3 Max models are also available in Silver, while the 14‑inch MacBook Pro with M3 is available in Silver and Space Gray – but not Space Black.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/f-294923bf190716df76bddba370c3157d0f049ba0.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919452" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-new-macbook-pro-featuring-m3-chips/">announced</a> next-generation 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro personal computers during its "Scary Fast" event. These new computers include the new M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, which were also announced during the event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/new-macbook-pro-image.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1076" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919500" /><br/>
Every model of the new lineup features a Liquid Retina XDR display with 20 percent brighter SDR content, a built-in 1080p camera, and a six speaker sound system. The new MacBook Pros offer up to 22 hours of battery life as well. The display also features 1,000 nits sustained and 1,600 nits of peak brightness for HDR content.<br/>
<br/>
The standard M3 chip has up to an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, the M3 Pro chip has up to a 12-core CPU and up to a 18-core GPU, and the M3 Max chip has up to a 16-core CPU and up to a 40-core GPU. The M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips support up to 24GB, 36GB, and 128GB of unified memory, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro is up to 60 percent faster than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1. For users with more demanding workflows, the 14-inch and 16-inch M3 Pro MacBook Pro is up to 40 percent faster than the 16-inch model with M1 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/new-macbook-pro-image-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919499" /><br/>
For ultimate performance, the 14-inch and 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro models offer up to 2.5x faster speeds than the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max, and up to 11x faster speeds than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips are built using 3-nanometer technology and offer a faster, more efficient next-generation GPU. They feature "Dynamic Caching" technology, meaning the GPU allocates the use of local memory in hardware in real time, ensuring only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the internal upgrades, there's also a new color in the MacBook Pro lineup: Space Black. Only M3 Pro and M3 Max versions of the computer are available in Space Black. Apple says the finish greatly reduces fingerprints thanks to an anodization seal. M3 Pro and M3 Max models also come in Silver, and the 14-inch M3 model comes in Silver and Space Gray.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are available to order today, and they will launch on Tuesday, November 7. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,599 (&#36;1,499 for education); the 14-inch M3 Pro MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,999 (&#36;1,849 for education); and the 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;2,499 (&#36;2,299 for education).<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">Apple Announces New 14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Models With M3 Series Chips</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-new-14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-with-m3-series-chips.2409248/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

At the event, Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-october-2023-event/">expected to announce</a> an updated 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip, and updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips. In addition, the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad for the Mac are expected to be updated with USB-C charging ports instead of Lightning. There is also a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/apple-scary-fast-event-battery-filings/">slim chance</a> that a seventh-generation iPad mini will be announced at the event.<br/>
<br/>
The event is being held online, with no in-person component at Apple Park. A live stream will be available <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-scary-fast-event-oct-30/">on Apple's website, on YouTube, and in the Apple TV app</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The upcoming iOS 17.2 update should fix various Wi-Fi issues that some iPhone users have experienced since iOS 17 was released, according <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/91867/apple-says-ios-172-beta-fixes-wifi-issues">to <em>iClarified</em></a>.<br/>

In response to a bug report filed by the website, Apple said the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-beta-1-to-developers/">first iOS 17.2 beta</a> released last week addresses Wi-Fi connectivity issues, although the company did not provide any specific details. Some users have complained about slow Wi-Fi speeds and dropped connections, but it's unclear how widespread the issues are.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 is expected to be released to the public in December, so there are still several weeks remaining until the update will be available to all users.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">many new features and changes</a>, including the promised Journal app, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/">Apple Says iOS 17.2 Will Fix Wi-Fi Connectivity Issues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-ios-17-2-will-fix-wi-fi-connectivity-issues.2409237/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 16 Pro to Feature Major Telephoto Lens Revision</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro models that are coming next year will feature a major camera lens overhaul, according to <em><a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/7540381">Economic Daily News</a></em>. Apple plans to use more advanced glass molded lenses, which the site says will lead to a thinner and lighter design, lenses that are shorter, and improved optical zoom magnification.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-16-Cameras-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919420" /><br/>
The updated glass is said to be limited to the Telephoto lens because of the difficult production process and limited production capacity. Apple representatives allegedly recently visited <a href="https://www.hoya-opticalworld.com/english/products/moldlenses.html">molded glass supplier Hoya</a>. Hoya's website says that it is able to produce large numbers of "highly accurate aspherical glass molded lenses." Apple will also source lenses from current supplier Largan Precision.<br/>
<br/>
The new lens technology is expected to be more expensive, so the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models could face "price pressure" next year.<br/>
<br/>
Back in July, Weibo account Digital Chat Station <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/iphone-16-pro-max-super-telephoto-camera/">referenced molded glass technology</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models, suggesting that Apple would introduce a "super" telephoto lens. Super is a label that is typically applied to cameras that have a focal length of over 300mm, which would far exceed the 120mm zoom of the current 5x tetraprism lens in the 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Both the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro and Pro Max are expected to offer the more advanced telephoto capabilities currently limited to the Pro Max, but Digital Chat Station suggested that "super" zoom capabilities could be limited to the Pro Max, which would give it even more advanced optical zoom than the 16 Pro.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/iphone-16-pro-telephoto-lens-revision/">iPhone 16 Pro to Feature Major Telephoto Lens Revision</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-major-telephoto-lens-revision.2409230/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Google Wanted iPhones to Come Pre-Installed With Google Search App</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Back in 2018, Google CEO Sundar Pichai asked Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> to ship iPhones with the Google Search app pre-installed, but Cook did not ultimately go for the idea. The information comes from the ongoing antitrust lawsuit that Google is facing from the U.S. Department of Justice, and it was shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938775/google-search-app-ios-built-in-antitrust"><em>The Verge</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837104" /><br/>
Pichai proposed the idea to Cook after Cook said that he wanted Apple to be "deep, deep partners" with Google. He told Cook that pre-installing the Google Search app would drive more traffic to Google, and therefore more money to Apple. Apple and Google have long had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/google-pays-apple-billions-default-search/">a search engine deal</a>, with Google paying &#36;18 to &#36;20 billion per year to be the default search engine on Apple devices, but in 2018, Apple's share of revenue was down.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, Pichai said that Cook should consider allowing Google to design an app or some other native <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> experience that would drive people to use Google search more often. "We said one of the things that works well on Android, which drives increased usage, is a Google Search application. So I proposed that we could build a Google search application for iOS... and we would be committed to supporting the product for many years," said Pichai.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple iPhones come with a number of Apple-created apps installed, Apple has never offered a pre-loaded third-party app, which is likely why the company did not accept Pichai's proposal.<br/>
<br/>
According to Pichai, he meets with Cook approximately once per year in order to discuss Google's search deal with Apple, which has been a major focus of the antitrust trial against Google. The U.S. Department of Justice believes that Google <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">has a search monopoly</a> that has turned it into the "gatekeeper of the internet," and the government is targeting some of the "exclusionary agreements" that Google has established with companies like Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple services chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/">testified in the trial in September</a>, and he said that Apple uses Google as the default option because the company has "always thought it was the best" and because there is no "valid alternative."<br/>
<br/>
Right now, Google is the default search engine option on all of Apple's devices. While the search engine can be changed on Apple products, many customers do not opt to choose one of the other options, which include Bing, Ecosia, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo. If the lawsuit determines that Google has engaged in antitrust activities, the deal between Apple and Google could be broken up, requiring Apple to provide additional search engine options during the Apple device setup process.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/google-search-iphone-pre-installed/">Google Wanted iPhones to Come Pre-Installed With Google Search App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-wanted-iphones-to-come-pre-installed-with-google-search-app.2409220/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's "Scary Fast" virtual media event kicks off at 5:00 pm Pacific Time today, an unusual time for an Apple event that will see it occurring in the middle of the night for some users not traditionally accustomed to that timing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-october-scary-fast-event.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918335" /><br/>
We know that some <em>MacRumors</em> readers who can't follow the event as it's being broadcast are interested in avoiding all of the announcements and waiting until the event video is available for on-demand viewing so as to experience it without already knowing the outcome. <br/>
<br/>
For those individuals, we've posted this news story, which will be updated with a direct link to the presentation once it becomes available from Apple. No other news stories or announcements will be displayed alongside this story.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's recent virtual events have been made available to view almost immediately following the conclusion of the broadcasts, and we expect similar timing for today's event.<br/>
<br/>
Users waiting for the video to be posted are welcome to gather in the thread associated with this news story, and we ask that those who follow the events as they occur refrain from making any posts about Apple's announcements in this thread.<br/>
<br/>

Although this doesn't beat Prime Day's steeper &#36;179.00 price tag, this is still a solid &#36;150 markdown on the new headphones.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can get the Beats Studio Pro headphones at this price in Deep Brown, Black, Navy, and Sandstone on Amazon. The headphones come with improved sound quality, voice performance, comfort and durability, and connectivity compared to previous generation Beats.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C8PT7DF5%2Fref%3Dfs_a_bt2_us0%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;150 OFF</div>Beats Studio Pro for &#36;199.95</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few other Beats devices on sale as we head into November, starting with the Beats Studio Buds at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB096SSCV5K%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa"><strong>&#36;99.95</strong></a>, down from &#36;149.95. Amazon has five colors on sale at this price, which is another solid second-best price.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp is planning to add passkey support to its iPhone app, according to code discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1718985018322653224">by software researcher @aaronp613</a> in the latest beta version of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
Passkey support would allow iPhone users to sign in to WhatsApp with Face ID, Touch ID, or the device's passcode. Passkeys are stored in iCloud Keychain. To use passkeys on the iPhone, the device must be updated to iOS 16 or later.<br/>
<br/>
"Passkeys are more secure than passwords, because they're uniquely generated for every account by your own device, and are less vulnerable to phishing," <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/iphone/iphf538ea8d0/ios">says</a> Apple. "And they work on all your devices that are signed in to the same Apple ID."<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear when WhatsApp plans to make this functionality available to the public, but it started rolling out passkey support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919609/whatsapp-passkey-android-update-passwordless-security">for Android</a> earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
