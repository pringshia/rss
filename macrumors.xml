		<description><![CDATA[Automattic, the company behind popular web management system WordPress, <a href="https://blog.beeper.com">has purchased Beeper</a> and will absorb Beeper's 27 employees. Beeper made headlines back in December for Beeper Mini, an app that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android/">brought iMessage to Android devices</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beeper-automattic-acquisition.png" alt="" width="1304" height="736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945616" /><br/>
Beeper Mini used reverse engineered iMessage protocols and encryption, taking advantage of Apple's own iMessage servers to let Android users send "blue bubble" texts to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users without an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>. The app supported all iMessage functionality, including read receipts, typing indictors, reactions, and end-to-end encryption.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was not happy with Beeper Mini using its iMessage servers, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/beeper-mini-imessage-for-android-shutdown/">blocked the Beeper Mini app</a>. Beeper <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/beeper-mini-android-imessage-app-back/">tried workarounds</a>, but after suggesting Android users acquire a jailbroken &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to get the service to work, the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/beeper-mini-jailbreak-iphone-last-effort/">gave up on the idea</a>.<br/>
<br/>
After Apple blocked Beeper Mini from working, both the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/22/doj-and-ftc-looking-into-beeper-controversy/">met with Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky</a>. Beeper Mini was ultimately mentioned in the DoJ's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-vs-doj/">antitrust filing against Apple</a>, with the DoJ suggesting it was a "fix" for the broken Android to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cross-platform messaging issue.<br/>
<br/>
Automattic does not plan to revive Beeper Mini, but is instead taking on Beeper, a universal chat app available for Android, iOS, and desktop devices. Beeper is able to integrate with multiple chat networks with a universal inbox, though it does not currently work with iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
In a post <a href="https://blog.beeper.com">announcing the acquisition</a> by Automattic, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky said that Beeper is "cautiously optimistic about the future" because the DoJ has "sued Apple for blocking Beeper Mini's access to iMessage."<br/>
<br/>
Going forward, Migicovsky will serve as Automattic's Head of Messaging, and Beeper will operate as an independent team. With the acquisition, Beeper is no longer in beta and has officially launched.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/beeper-app-automattic-acquisition/">Beeper App That Created Workaround for iMessage on Android Acquired by WordPress Owner Automattic</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beeper-app-that-created-workaround-for-imessage-on-android-acquired-by-wordpress-owner-automattic.2423894/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<category>Teen Survey</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> continues to be overwhelmingly popular with teens, according to Piper Sandler's <a href="https://www.pipersandler.com/teens">biannual teen survey</a>. 85 percent of U.S. teens surveyed own an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and 86 percent plan to purchase an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as their next smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/best-early-black-friday-iphone-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920873" /><br/>
While the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is still the most popular smartphone among teens, ownership is down from the October 2023 survey where <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/iphone-teen-survey-2023/">87 percent of teens</a> owned an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and 88 percent planned to purchase one.<blockquote>Both the 85% iPhone ownership and 86% intention to purchase an iPhone metrics are near record highs for our survey but down from record levels in 2021. We believe the elevated penetration and purchase intention are important given the mature premium smartphone market. Additionally, trends towards premium tier phones are encouraging as the company continues to introduce new iPhones proving the overall stickiness of the product portfolio. Finally, positive trends in services could follow, as the install base for Apple hardware continues to grow.</blockquote>Apple's dominance in the teen market is of particular interest right now because it is one metric that the U.S. Department of Justice is targeting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-vs-doj/">in its antitrust lawsuit against Apple</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The DoJ has suggested that Apple's ownership of the U.S. smartphone market causes "social stigma, exclusion, and blame" for non-iPhone users, with "green bubble" chats and issues between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android message users cited as a specific example. The DoJ claims that this is "particularly powerful" for teenagers, and that "social pressure" causes teens to switch to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The antitrust lawsuit also suggests that Apple's marketshare among "key demographics" like "younger audiences" is an issue that gives Apple too much power over the smartphone ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Apple Watch, 34 percent of teens reported using an Apple Watch, with no change from last fall. Intent to buy an Apple Watch was up three percent, however, with 13 percent of teens planning to buy one in the next six months. Only 39.4 percent of teens said they own a smart watch, so teens are also overwhelmingly preferring the Apple Watch to other smart watch brands. The Apple Watch was the top watch brand, with Rolex and Casio coming in second and third, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Teens prefer Spotify as their music service, and nearly two-thirds of teens surveyed said Spotify is their preferred service. Just over 30 percent of teens said they use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> is not popular with teen audiences, and less than five percent of teens said they watch it on a daily basis. Comparatively, over 30 percent of teens watch Netflix daily, and close to 30 percent watch YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> was the most popular payment platform with 44 percent of teens using it in the last month, but Cash app and Venmo are preferred for peer-to-peer money transfers.<br/>
<br/>
Piper Sandler surveyed 6,020 teens across 47 U.S. states for its spring 2024 report. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teen-survey/">Teen Survey</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/iphone-teen-survey-spring-2024/">Teens Love iPhone and Apple Watch, But Not Apple Music and Apple TV+</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/teens-love-iphone-and-apple-watch-but-not-apple-music-and-apple-tv.2423887/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> owners have been dealing with health issues related to the wearing of the headset, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/some-apple-vision-pro-userssufferblack-eyes-headaches-and-neck-pain-626291fc">MarketWatch</a></em>. The site spoke to Vision Pro owners experiencing headaches and neck pain, among other issues.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-vision-pro-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944159" /><br/>
Emily Olman, marketing chief of Hopscotch Interactive, said she got two "superdark black eyes" after wearing the Vision Pro for the first time, likely caused by the weight on the cheeks. Ian Beacraft, CEO of consulting firm Signal, told <em>MarketWatch</em> that he had pain at the base of his skull and his upper back.<br/>
<br/>
There have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1apmvy2/discomfort_and_headaches_with_vision_pro/">also been complaints</a> about the Vision Pro on Reddit from users experiencing ongoing headaches, eye strain, and pain <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1bv4fg2/avp_is_just_too_heavy_for_me/">from the weight</a> of the device. Some users have had luck <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1by760m/the_most_comfortable_avp_strap_that_works_in_any/">with modified straps</a> and third-party products, and other people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1bz2fp1/today_ive_been_on_my_avp_for_about_3_hours_or_so/">have no issue</a> with the headset and the default band options.<br/>
<br/>
Apple declined to comment on the customer complaints, directing <em>MarketWatch</em> to its user guidelines. Apple recommends taking a break from the headset every 20 to 30 minutes during the acclimation period, and to stop using the headset when feeling unwell. Apple does not recommend that people experiencing eye strain, headache, or pain continue to use the device.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.1.2, a minor update to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; operating system that came out alongside the Vision Pro in February. &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1.2 comes a month after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-visionos-1-1/">the launch of visionOS 1.1</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934088" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-Home-Screen.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; updates can be installed by going to the Settings app on the Vision Pro, selecting the General section, and choosing Software Update. The Vision Pro headset will need to be removed to install new software, with a progress bar available on the front EyeSight display.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, the update introduces unspecified bug fixes and is recommended for all users.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also released a revised &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.2 beta that is available to developers. The new version has a 21O5555f version number, up from the prior 21O5555e version.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is pushing regular updates to &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj;. As mentioned above, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-visionos-1-2-beta-1-to-developers/">visionOS 1.2 update</a> is already being beta tested, and we're expecting to see &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 2 introduced in June with a whole new feature set.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Series 9 is now available in Apple's refurbished store in <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-series-9">Australia</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/nz/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-series-9">New Zealand</a> for the first time since the device launched in September. These are the first countries where Apple offers refurbished Series 9 models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
Availability will likely extend to <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-series-9">Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-series-9">the UK</a> soon, as Apple recently added a grayed-out Apple Watch Series 9 search filter to its refurbished store in those countries. The search filter is only visible on these pages in a desktop browser, and it is possible that Apple will remove them following our report, as it has done in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to begin selling refurbished Apple Watch Ultra 2 models anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if and when refurbished Series 9 and Ultra 2 models will be available in the U.S. due to Apple's legal battle with health company Masimo. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/">banned Apple</a> from importing and selling Apple Watch models with a functioning Blood Oxygen app after it ruled that the feature infringed on Masimo's patents. Apple recently appealed the decision <a href="https://ipfray.com/apples-opening-brief-in-appeal-of-watch-case-places-emphasis-on-itcs-domestic-industry-requirement/">in a 916-page court filing</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could opt to sell refurbished Series 9 and Ultra 2 models in the U.S. with the Blood Oxygen app deactivated, as it is currently doing for brand new models. Apple would be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensor-software/">reactivate the app with a watchOS update</a> if its appeal is successful, or if it eventually reaches a settlement with Masimo to end the dispute.<br/>
<br/>
Since the ITC's ruling applies to the U.S. only, the Blood Oxygen app is still functional on new and refurbished Apple Watch models sold in all other countries.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/refurbished-apple-watch-series-9-internationally/">Apple Watch Series 9 Now Available on Apple&#039;s Refurbished Store in Select Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-now-available-on-apples-refurbished-store-in-select-countries.2423866/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The unique internal design of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> compared to its direct rivals was today revealed in CT scans performed by <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/apple-vision-pro-meta-quest-pro-3-non-destructive-teardown">Lumafield</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5_gja9O-GE?si=ADK8SNMurI2Oes9I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Lumafield used its Neptune industrial CT scanner and Voyager analysis software to conduct non-destructive teardowns of the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 3. The study began by examining the internal design and layout of the headsets, noting the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;'s emphasis on efficient use of space.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro's components are arranged in a manner that maximizes internal space without compromising the exterior, featuring a flexible PCB ribbon and electronics positioned at various angles. This contrasts with the Meta Quest Pro and Quest 3, which utilize a more traditional approach by stacking primary elements on a single plane.<br/>
<br/>
An examination of the sensors across the devices reveals the Vision Pro's advanced use of eye and hand tracking technologies for UI navigation, involving a variety of sensors such as LiDAR and IR cameras. The Meta Quest devices, on the other hand, incorporate handheld controllers and an experimental version of hand tracking.<br/>
<br/>
Thermal management strategies also vary significantly between the headsets. The Quest Pro's uses a combination of basic active and passive cooling, while the Vision Pro features micro-blowers. Battery design and placement further differentiate the headsets, with the Vision Pro opting for an external battery pack to prioritize performance, while the Meta Quest models integrate the battery within the headset for user convenience.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been nearly a year and a half since the current Apple TV was released, so the device is becoming due for a hardware upgrade. Below, we recap rumors about the next Apple TV, including potential features and launch timing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" /><br/>
The current model is the third-generation Apple TV 4K, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/apple-announces-apple-tv-with-a15-and-hdr10-for-129/">announced in October 2022</a>. Key new features compared to the previous model from 2021 include a faster A15 Bionic chip, a larger 128GB storage option, a slightly thinner and lighter design, HDR10+ support, a USB-C port on the Siri Remote, lower pricing, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/19/10-new-features-of-2022-apple-tv/">more</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Launch Timing</h2><br/>
In January 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">new Apple TV would be released in the first half of 2024</a>. If that timeframe remains accurate, a new Apple TV would be released by the end of June. If so, the device could be announced in a press release on Apple's website, or unveiled during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has not commented on the next Apple TV in recent months, and his report was published nearly 15 months ago, so it is unclear if the device remains on track to launch in the first half of 2024 or if Apple's plans have changed.<br/>
<br/>
Announcement dates for recent Apple TV models:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li><br/>
<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Rumors</h2><br/>
<h3>Faster Chip</h3><br/>
The next Apple TV will be equipped with a faster processor compared to the current model, according to Gurman's report last year. It's unclear which chip will power the device, but possibilities include the A16 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 14 Pro models or the A17 Pro chip that debuted in the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Lower Price</h3><br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects the next Apple TV to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">"more affordable" than the current model</a>. He said a "sub-&#36;100 price" would be the "sweet spot" for the Apple TV, but exact pricing for the next model remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
Both the second-generation (2010) and third-generation (2012) versions of the Apple TV were priced at &#36;99 in the U.S. at launch, and Apple eventually lowered the price of the third-generation model to &#36;69, so there is precedent for a sub-&#36;100 Apple TV that would better compete with low-priced streaming devices sold by Google, Amazon, and Roku.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., the current Apple TV starts at &#36;129 with 64GB of storage, and a 128GB model with an added Ethernet port is available for &#36;149.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Same Design</h3><br/>
The new Apple TV will have the same external design as the current model, Gurman said.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said the A15 Bionic chip's increased power efficiency allowed for the fan to be removed in the current Apple TV, resulting in the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/new-apple-tv-4k-fanless-design-thinner-lighter/">having a more compact design</a> that is around 12% thinner and around 50% lighter than the previous model.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV With Camera</h2><br/>
A future Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">could have a built-in camera</a> for FaceTime and other video calling apps, Gurman said in his <em>Power On</em> newsletter a few days ago.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">tvOS 17 added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if a camera would be added to the next Apple TV or a later model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/when-to-expect-a-new-apple-tv/">When to Expect a New Apple TV to Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-to-expect-a-new-apple-tv-to-launch.2423860/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/">highlighted</a> the Vision Pro headset's enterprise use-cases, such as customizable workspaces, collaboration on 3D designs, delivering specialized employee training, and guiding remote fieldwork. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Vision-Pro-NVIDIA-Omniverse-Cloud-APIs.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-945455" /><br/>
Apple explained how the Vision Pro can enhance business productivity, featuring integration with widely used applications like SAP Analytics Cloud and Microsoft 365 in a spatial computing context. For example, SAP Analytics Cloud on the Vision Pro allows users to interact with their data in three-dimensional space, offering insights that were previously unattainable in a flat, two-dimensional interface. Similarly, Microsoft 365 apps have been optimized for the headset, providing users with a unique, distraction-free workspace that leverages the infinite canvas of spatial computing for multitasking and collaboration.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro's high-resolution displays and processing capabilities allow for the creation and manipulation of digital twins of products, facilities, and processes with a high level of detail and accuracy. This has significant implications for industries like automotive engineering, where real-time data analysis and decision-making are crucial. Apple pointed out its partnership with Porsche to create the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/tim-cook-appears-in-porsche-premiere-video/">Porsche Race Engineer app</a> as an example of this.<br/>
<br/>
Training and simulation represent another area where the Vision Pro could make a substantial impact. By enabling realistic, immersive training experiences, companies like KLM Royal Dutch Airlines can improve technical maintenance and operations without the need for costly physical prototypes or taking equipment offline for training purposes. The Engine Shop app, for instance, allows KLM technicians to train on engine models in full fidelity within their own space, streamlining the training process and reducing the likelihood of errors. Similarly, Resolve's app for building engineers enhances the planning and execution of maintenance work by overlaying detailed schematics and 3D models onto the physical world.<br/>
<br/>
To encourage the development and integration of the Vision Pro in business workflows, Apple has introduced a range of developer resources, including the Enterprise Spatial Design Lab, and partnerships with industry leaders like Deloitte and Porsche. See Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/">full press release</a> for more information.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/how-business-can-use-vision-pro/">Apple Highlights How Business Can Use Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-highlights-how-business-can-use-vision-pro.2423851/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is "unlikely" to hold an event to announce new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, according to sources cited by Taiwanese supply chain publication <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240408PD208/apple-ipad-iphone.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>.<br/>

<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman already said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">Apple was not planning to hold an event for the new iPads</a>, but he made this claim back in early March, before it was reported that the devices were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-suppliers-say-new-ipads-repeatedly-postponed/">postponed due to manufacturing delays</a>. With the new iPads <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">now expected to launch in early May</a>, <em>DigiTimes</em> believes Apple is still not planning to hold an event.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of an event, it is likely that Apple will announce the new iPads in a press release shared on its website, as it did for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">MacBook Air models with the M3 chip</a> in early March. Gurman believes Apple will announce the new iPads <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/gurman-new-ipads-first-week-of-may/">by the second week of May</a>, barring any further delays due to production challenges.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said two factors contributing to the new iPads being delayed were Apple still finishing iPadOS software development for the new iPads, and advanced manufacturing techniques for the OLED displays that the devices will use.<br/>
<br/>
A recap of the iPad-related products that Apple is expected to announce:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Two new iPad Pro models with the M3 chip, OLED displays, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">thinner enclosure</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-models-thinner-bezels-rumor/">thinner bezels</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/">matte screen option</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, other design changes, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">possibly MagSafe wireless charging</a>.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to use new low-energy OLED panel technology in the next Apple Watch to further reduce the power consumption of its always-on display, claims a new report out of Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/apple-watch-series-9-display.jpeg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913380" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=27119">The Elec</a></em>, Apple will adopt new low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) thin-film transistor (TFT) technology for its upcoming Apple Watch, which is scheduled to be released in the second half of this year.<br/>
<br/>
LPTO TFT is a method of applying oxide on the driving TFT and the switching transistors behind each pixel. Switching transistors control the voltage applied to the liquid crystal cells, allowing precise control of the amount of light that passes through each pixel.  <br/>
<br/>
Existing Apple Watch OLED displays use LPTO TFT in only a few switching transistors, and rely on low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) technology for the majority of transistors as well as the driving TFT.<br/>
<br/>
Using oxide instead of LTPS for the driving TFT and more of the switching transistors means that oxide alone is responsible for the current running through the majority of transistors that connect directly to the OLED pixel. In the new LTPO OLED application, increased use of oxide means lower leakage current and more stable operation at low refresh rates, resulting in overall power savings.<br/>
<br/>
The downside is that the technique means more complication in the manufacturing of the TFT substrates. According to the report, LG Display is expected to take the lead in the development of the new LPTO OLED technology. Meanwhile, Samsung is participating in a development project that should see it join Apple's LPTO OLED supply chain in time for next year's Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
This has led to industry speculation that Apple is planning to expand the use of LPTO OLED technology to other products such as the iPhone. The current iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus use LTPS panels, while Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models use the more advanced LTPO panels, which support variable refresh rates.<br/>

Apple is expected to retain the use of the less advanced LTPS panels in this year's iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to maintain differentiation between its standard and Pro models. However, next year's iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Plus are expected to adopt the same technology, which would mean Apple's 2025 iPhone series will be the first of its kind to feature ProMotion and always-on displays across the lineup.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/">The Elec</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/2024-apple-watch-more-power-efficient-display/">Next Apple Watch Could Feature More Power Efficient OLED Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-apple-watch-could-feature-more-power-efficient-oled-display.2423834/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Alleged iPhone 16 Battery Details Show Smaller Capacity for One Model</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 lineup will feature bigger battery capacities compared to previous-generation models with the exception of the iPhone 16 Plus, which will have a smaller battery than its predecessor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
That's according to the Chinese Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6315816381/5018345584463802">OvO Baby Sauce OvO</a>, a relatively new source of supply chain leaks with an as-yet unproven track record for accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 16 battery capacity details posted by the Weibo leaker match figures <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">previously shared on X</a> by "Majin Bu," with the notable addition of a figure for the iPhone 16 Pro model, which Majin Bu omitted. That makes this leak the first time we have been provided with alleged iPhone 16 battery capacity changes across the board.<br/>
<br/>
The figures show that the ‌iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro,‌ and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature larger batteries than their predecessors, but the ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus is allegedly facing a reduction in terms of battery capacity compared to the iPhone 15 Plus.<br/>
<br/>
Why that would be the case isn't clear, since apart from the size difference, both the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus are expected to have an identical feature set. One possibility is that the capacity reduction turns out to be negligible in real terms thanks to efficiency improvements in other areas. On the other hand, by reducing capacity, Apple could be trying to maximize differentiation between the iPhone 16 Plus and the iPhone 16 Pro Max in an attempt to nudge customers toward the premium features (and prices) of its top tier model.<br/>

<br/>
When the iPhone 14 Plus was introduced into Apple's smartphone lineup to replace the iPhone 13 mini, it gave customers the opportunity to own a device with the same 6.7-inch display as the iPhone 14 Pro Max without paying a premium. In addition, the iPhone 14 Plus also had the advantage of a larger capacity battery than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, allowing Apple to market the device as featuring "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOQdo7t3Xk">our longest battery life.</a>"<br/>
<br/>
However, with the advent of the iPhone 15 series, Apple increased the battery capacity of the iPhone 15 Pro Max to make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone. <br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223409700148&navType=by">another rumor</a>, this year's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max will boast an even bigger 30-hour-plus battery life (compared to 29 hours for the iPhone 15 Pro Max). Not only that, both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/iphone-sizes-to-change-next-year-what-to-know/">slightly larger displays</a>. If Apple does intend to reduce the battery in the iPhone 16 Plus, it would widen the gap further between the two tiers. The iPhone 16 lineup is expected to be announced in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/alleged-iphone-16-battery-details-leaked/">Alleged iPhone 16 Battery Details Show Smaller Capacity for One Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-iphone-16-battery-details-show-smaller-capacity-for-one-model.2423828/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[X, formerly Twitter, has extended support for passkeys as a login option for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users across the globe, the company has <a href="https://x.com/Safety/status/1777415876620472799">announced</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/X-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904140" /><br/>
Passkeys support was introduced by X earlier this year, but the option was limited to iOS users based in the United States. Now anyone on the social media platform can use them.<br/>
<br/>
Passkeys are both easier to use and more secure than passwords because they let users sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices: With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, or a device passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple integrated passkeys into iOS in 2022 with the launch of iOS 16, and it is also available in iPadOS 16.1 and later as well as macOS Ventura and later.<br/>
<br/>
To set up passkeys in X on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, follow these steps:<br/>
<ol><li>Log in to the X app.</li><br/>
<li>Click <strong>Your account</strong> in the navigation bar.</li><br/>
<li>Select <strong>Settings and privacy</strong>, then click <strong>Security and account access</strong>, then <strong>Security</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under <strong>Additional password protection</strong>, click <strong>Passkey</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Enter your password when prompted.</li><br/>
<li>Select <strong>Add a passkey</strong> and follow the prompts.</li></ol> <div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update: Passkeys is now available as a login option for everyone globally on iOS! Try it out.<a href="https://t.co/v1LyN0l8wF">https://t.co/v1LyN0l8wF</a></p>&mdash; Safety (@Safety) <a href="https://twitter.com/Safety/status/1777415876620472799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
X is just one of several companies to implement support for passkeys in recent months, with other supporting apps and websites including Google, PayPal, Best Buy, eBay, Dashlane, and Microsoft.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/passkeys/">Passkeys</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/x-rolls-out-passkeys-support-globally-ios/">X Rolls Out Passkeys Support to iPhone Users Worldwide</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/x-rolls-out-passkeys-support-to-iphone-users-worldwide.2423824/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-find-my-device/">today introduced</a> the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> Device network for Android-based products, mirroring the functionality of Apple's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network that's designed to locate Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/android-find-my-device.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="557" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945346" /><br/>
Like Apple &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, the Android &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Device network is able to use the millions of Android devices (running Android 9 or later) out in the wild to track down lost, stolen, and missing Android products. A lost Android smartphone is able to ping nearby Android devices using Bluetooth, relaying location information back to the owner.<br/>
<br/>
Because the network uses Bluetooth, it works even when Android devices are offline and do not have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection. Some devices, such as the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, will be locatable even when powered off or when the battery is dead. &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; offers the same feature set for iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Starting in May, the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Device network for Android smartphones will also work with Bluetooth trackers from companies like Chipolo and Pebblebee, allowing Android users to attach trackers to items to locate them with the Android network. While Google isn't designing its own trackers, these third-party trackers will work in the same way that AirTags work.<br/>
<br/>
To keep <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from being tracked without their knowledge using this new network, Google worked with Apple to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/apple-to-expand-unwanted-tracking-alerts/">create an industry specification</a> that lets both &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android users get alerts about nearby unknown item trackers regardless of the brand of the tracking device. Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/google-android-find-my-device-network/">waited until Apple implemented support</a> for third-party tracker alerts to launch its network, based on code found in iOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-third-party-item-tracker-alerts/">iOS 17.5 appears to expand</a> the "Found Moving With You" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> alerts to third-party item trackers, allowing the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to recognize Android-based item trackers and those from other companies. "You can disable this item and stop it from sharing its location with the owner. To do this, follow the instructions provided on a website by the manufacturer of this item," reads some of the iOS 17.5 code.<br/>
<br/>
Google was able to learn from the criticism that Apple faced after launching AirTags. There have been numerous news stories and reports of criminals using AirTags for stalking, car thefts, and more, leading Apple to make multiple changes to unwanted tracker alerts. Apple upped the frequency of notifications and also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/android-tracker-detect-app/">designed a Tracker Detect app</a> for Android devices, but Apple's work with Google ensures a more permanent solution that keeps Android and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users safe as another major tracking network launches.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/08/google-android-find-my-device-network-2/">Google Launches Android Find My Device Network</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-launches-android-find-my-device-network.2423788/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft will advertise that its upcoming Windows laptops with Qualcomm's <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/pcs-and-tablets/snapdragon-x-elite">Snapdragon X Elite processor</a> are faster than the MacBook Air with Apple's latest M3 chip, according to internal documents obtained <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24116587/microsoft-macbook-air-surface-arm-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite">by <em>The Verge</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-X-Elite-Laptop.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945341" /><br/>
"Microsoft is so confident in these new Qualcomm chips that it's planning a number of demos that will show how these processors will be faster than an M3 MacBook Air for CPU tasks, AI acceleration, and even app emulation," the report says. Microsoft believes its laptops will offer "faster app emulation" than Apple's Rosetta 2.<br/>
<br/>
Introduced in October, the Snapdragon X Elite has Arm-based architecture like Apple silicon. Qualcomm last year claimed that the processor achieved <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-faster-apple/">21% faster multi-core CPU performance than the M3 chip</a>, based on the Geekbench 6 benchmark tool.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few caveats here, including that Microsoft and Qualcomm are comparing to Apple's lower-end M3 chip instead of its higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max chips. MacBooks with Apple silicon also offer industry-leading performance-per-watt, while the Snapdragon X Elite will likely run hotter and require laptops with fans. Since being updated with the M1 chip in 2020, the MacBook Air has featured a fanless design. Apple can also optimize the performance of MacBooks since it controls both the hardware and macOS software.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is believed to be among the companies seeking an agreement with Photobucket to train its artificial intelligence models, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/inside-big-techs-underground-race-buy-ai-training-data-2024-04-05/"><em>Reuters</em></a> reports.<br/>

Photobucket's vast image library of over 13 billion photos and videos has attracted renewed interest as tech companies, including Apple, seek to license content for AI training purposes. The rise of generative AI has spurred demand for diverse datasets, and companies like Photobucket are able provide a vast amount of of visual data that could train AI to produce content in response to text prompts.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already reached an agreement with Shutterstock to license millions of images shortly after the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022, in a deal believed to be worth &#36;25 million to &#36;50 million. The pursuit of "ethically sourced" and legally clear data marks a departure from the earlier practice of freely scraping web data. Apple is reportedly preparing to showcase a series of AI features with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and its other major software updates at WWDC in June.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/08/apple-deal-to-license-images-to-train-ai/">Apple Seeking Deal to License Billions of Images to Train AI Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeking-deal-to-license-billions-of-images-to-train-ai-models.2423769/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
