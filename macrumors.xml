		<description><![CDATA[The widely-rumored titanium frame on Apple's upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will make the devices about 10% lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro models, according to a report today <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-XS-Max-Black-Background.jpeg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909569" /><br/>
The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max weigh 206 grams and 240 grams, respectively, according to Apple's tech specs for the devices. An approximate 10% weight reduction would result in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max weighing around 185 grams and 216 grams, respectively. This would make the iPhone 15 Pro the lightest Pro model since the iPhone XS, which weighs 177 grams. Likewise, the iPhone 15 Pro Max would be the lightest Max model since the iPhone XS Max, which weighed 208 grams.<br/>
<br/>
Given that Gurman said the weight reduction will be "about" 10%, the exact figures remain to be seen. If the iPhone 15 Pro ends up being 188 grams or heavier, it would instead be the most lightweight Pro model since the iPhone 11 Pro. In any case, it appears that the upcoming Pro models will be the lightest in several generations of devices.<br/>
<br/>
Pro model weights:<ul><li><strong>iPhone X:</strong> 174 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone XS:</strong> 177 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 11 Pro:</strong> 188 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro:</strong> 189 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro:</strong> 203 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 14 Pro:</strong> 206 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro:</strong> ~185 grams?</li></ul>Pro Max model weights:<ul><li><strong>iPhone XS Max:</strong> 208 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 11 Pro Max:</strong> 226 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro Max:</strong> 228 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro Max:</strong> 238 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 14 Pro Max:</strong> 240 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max:</strong> ~216 grams?</li></ul>Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 15 series at its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">"Wonderlust" event on Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

All tablets in this sale are in new condition and come with a one year Apple warranty.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/ipad-pro-m1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1780" height="1001" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800056" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Woot. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the 11-inch iPad Pro, Woot is offering these tablets with the Apple Smart Folio in select colors. Prices start at &#36;659.99 (22 percent off) for 128GB Wi-Fi and rise to &#36;849.99 (50 percent off) for 2TB Wi-Fi.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-13142085?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-apple-2021-11-ipad-pro-with-case-3%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_3"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO 50% OFF</div>11-Inch M1 iPad Pro at Woot</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Woot also has multiple 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, and these do not come with the Apple Smart Folio. Prices start at &#36;859.99 (22 percent off) for 128GB Wi-Fi and rise to &#36;949.99 (27 percent off) for 512GB Wi-Fi. As of writing, Woot does not have any 1TB or 2TB versions of the 12.9-inch Wi-Fi iPad Pro in stock.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-13142085?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-apple-2021-12-9-ipad-pro-3%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO 27% OFF</div>12.9-Inch M1 iPad Pro at Woot</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
In addition to Wi-Fi models, Woot also has the <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-13142085?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Fplus%2F2021-apple-ipad-pro-your-choice-1%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_gw_dly_snb">cellular versions</a> of the 11-inch and 12.9-inch M1 iPad Pro tablets on sale. Woot's sale will last through September 18, although it could end earlier if select tablets sell out, so be sure to browse soon if you're interested.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't tracked discounts on the M1 iPad Pro at other retailers in about a year, given that recent sales have shifted to focus on the M2 models that launched in 2022. These tablets are fairly similar to one another, with the biggest advantages in the 2022 model being the M2 chip's internal upgrades and Apple Pencil hover.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to bring a USB-C port to the standard AirPods and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> as soon as 2024, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/airpods-max-flat.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-775235" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">new article</a> outlining his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/last-minute-iphone-15-report-reveals-new-details/">specific expectations</a> for Apple's "Wonderlust" event, featuring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-sensors-and-more/">new details</a> about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, Gurman mentioned that the company is apparently working to move all of its Lightning-based accessories to USB-C. <br/>
<br/>
USB-C will come to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> first, with the switch being introduced during Apple's event next week where it is expected to be a key feature of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, followed by the other AirPods models as soon as next year. The new &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; set to be introduced next week will not offer "any other major new hardware features," Gurman said.<br/>
<br/>
In the long term, Gurman reinforced that Apple is working on bringing health features to its AirPods, including body-temperature sensing and a hearing-test system. These improvements are likely to arrive at some point after the switch to USB-C across the lineup.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/">USB-C</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/usb-c-airpods-and-airpods-max-2024/">USB-C Reportedly Coming to AirPods and AirPods Max as Soon as 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/usb-c-reportedly-coming-to-airpods-and-airpods-max-as-soon-as-2024.2400805/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a> will offer several previously undisclosed features, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> claims.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-Series-9-Pink-Aluminum-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905452" /><br/>
In a detailed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">report</a> outlining his full expectations for Apple's "Wonderlust" event, Gurman said that the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and second-generation &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj; will offer various sensor and component upgrades, with a general "focus on speed, efficiency, and accuracy." These changes will include a new version of Apple's optical heart rate sensor. The Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8 feature Apple's third-generation optical heart rate sensor.<br/>
<br/>
The new Apple Watches will also feature an all-new "U2" ultra wideband chip, the first generational iteration of the component since the U1 chip's 2019 introduction in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 11 Pro. The new chip will improve the Apple Watch's location capabilities, allowing people and devices to be tracked more precisely in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> App. It is apparently set to come to all of the next versions of Apple's major products, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj; will be manufactured with more recycled materials, as well as come in a black color option for the first time. As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/apple-3d-printing-device-components/">previously reported</a>, the stainless steel &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; will feature a 3D-printed casing. Apple plans to start manufacturing the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj; with the technology starting next year. <br/>
<br/>
This year's main Apple Watch upgrade will be a new processor, which has to date effectively not been changed throughout three successive generations of the device. Apple apparently plans to "heavily tout major gains in processing speed" during its "Wonderlust" event.<br/>
<br/>
The new Apple Watch models will otherwise be largely unchanged compared to their predecessors. The company also plans to shift away from some of its leather watch bands, and there are signs that Apple may finally update or discontinue the Link Bracelet introduced alongside the original Apple Watch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-sensors-and-more/">Gurman: Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 to Feature New Heart Rate Monitor, More Accurate Sensors, U2 Chip, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-new-heart-rate-monitor-more-accurate-sensors-u2-chip-and-more.2400803/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> today shared his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">expectations</a> for Apple's "Wonderlust" event, revealing several significant new features for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Blue-Three-Quarters-Perspective-Camera-Closeup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909012" /><br/>
Gurman claims that the new titanium chassis of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models will be more durable, reduce weight by around 10 percent, and have a brushed effect, unlike the polished finish of the current devices that have stainless steel frames, to reduce fingerprints. The edges where the metal sides and glass front and back of the device meet are now more smooth and rounded. He added that the displays of both Pro models will look perceptibly larger due to their reduced bezels, which are about one-third smaller. <br/>
<br/>
While the A17 Bionic will offer improved performance thanks to its first-of-its-kind <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> fabrication process, one of the main benefits of the chip will apparently be enhanced battery life. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; Max currently have a battery life of around 23- and 29-hours, respectively. The next-generation devices will also feature more memory, increasing from the 6GB of memory that have been offered in Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models in recent years.<br/>
<br/>
The new "Action Button" that replaces the mute switch have customizable functionality to perform tasks including "silencing the phone, turning on a Focus mode, opening the flashlight, launching the camera, starting a voice recording, opening <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> shortcuts, pulling up the digital magnifying glass and opening accessibility settings."<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max's telephoto and ultra wide cameras will feature more megapixels than their predecessors, increasing beyond 12-megapixels for the first time. Gurman also clarified that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max will retain its "Pro Max" moniker, and will not be branded as an "Ultra" model as some previous rumors have suggested.<br/>
<br/>
Both the standard and the Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models will feature an all-new "U2" ultra wideband chip, the first iteration of the component since the U1 chip's introduction in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 Pro in 2019. The new chip will improve location capabilities, allowing people and devices to be tracked more precisely in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> App. It is apparently set to come to all of the next versions of Apple's major products. Another improvement coming to the entire &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup is faster wireless charging speeds and a more repairable design.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series launch potentially now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/when-will-iphone-15-be-released/">just two weeks away</a>, Apple retail employees are <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223204211450&navType=by">reportedly</a> being drilled to emphasize to customers at the point of sale that the switch to USB-C means the new devices cannot be charged with existing Lightning charging cables that they may already own. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iPhone-15-to-Switch-From-Lightning-to-USB-C-in-2023-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2621" height="1475" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845312" /><br/>
When customers purchase a new &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model, Apple staff will be trained to caution that while a USB-C to USB-C cable is included in the box, a USB-C charger is not. Employees will therefore direct customers to the in-store availability of Apple USB-C power adapters and additional Apple-certified USB-C cables to meet the need for multiple charging locations.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has used its proprietary Lightning port on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models for over 10 years, but in recent years Apple's Macs and iPads have all transitioned to the more common USB-C charging standard. Pressure to comply with new regulations implemented in Europe reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-iphone-15-lightning-test/">hastened the company's decision to switch to USB-C for iPhones</a>, however despite its initial reluctance to make the change in 2023, Apple stands to profit enormously from the switch.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/kuo-iphone-usb-c-faster-charging-speeds/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple in March significantly increased the total shipment forecast of its 20W USB-C charger by approximately 120% for the third quarter of this year, and set 20W USB-C charger shipments at about 70 million units for the fourth quarter. Overall, Apple's 20W USB-C charger shipments in 2023 are anticipated to see a significant 30–40% year-on-year growth, amounting to 230–240 million units, thanks to the strong replacement demand.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo believes Apple's upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; series will include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/kuo-iphone-usb-c-faster-charging-speeds/">support for faster charging speeds</a> when used with MFi-certified USB-C chargers, including its own 20W Power Adapter, while Leaker ShrimpApplePro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/">has said</a> that &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models will only officially support USB-C accessories certified by the Apple Made for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (MFi) program. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/usb-c-power-adapter.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="988" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909462" /><br/>
Meanwhile Apple supplier Foxconn is said to be producing accessories like EarPods and cables with USB-C connectors that are MFi certified, and Apple is also expected to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/usb-c-airpods-pro-no-other-hardware-changes/">new AirPods Pro USB-C charging case</a>.<br/>
<br/>
At least some of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models could support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/17/iphone-15-faster-charging-speeds/">charging speeds up to 35W</a>, which would allow for quicker charging with an appropriate power adapter. It is not clear if this is a feature that will be available for all of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models or just the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
At the current time, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models can charge at a maximum of around 27W, with the Pro models able to charge a bit faster. An increase to 35W would speed up charging times. If the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;‌ models support up to 35W charging, Apple could start recommending its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">30W MacBook Air charger</a> or its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/17/apple-35w-chargers-available-to-order/">35W Dual USB-C charger</a> for maximum charging speed.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, Apple stands to gain significant revenue from USB-C accessory sales as it effectively renders obsolete Lightning cables and connecting USB-A chargers already used by millions of Apple customers worldwide. With &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; prices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-pro-models-expected-to-be-more-expensive/">expected to increase</a>, many customers in the market for a new model this year will also therefore have to brace themselves for the additional financial burden of replacement chargers and cables.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will unveil the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; series at an event scheduled for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time. A live stream of the event will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/apple-wonderlust-event-live-stream/">available on YouTube</a>, on Apple's website, and in the Apple Events app for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c-iphone/">USB-C iPhone</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/apple-staff-recommend-iphone-15-usb-c-accessories/">Apple Retail Staff Drilled to Recommend iPhone 15 USB-C Charging Accessories at Point of Sale</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-retail-staff-drilled-to-recommend-iphone-15-usb-c-charging-accessories-at-point-of-sale.2400794/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17, Siri has learned a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-siri-spotlight/">few more useful features</a> worth knowing about. One is the ability to use Siri to send messages to friends and family over compatible third-party apps. Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-Siri-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903813" /><br/>
When you ask ‌Siri‌ to send a message in iOS 17, you can now tap to select which app on your iPhone that you want to send it from. This allows you to send messages not just from Apple's built-in Messages app, but also third-party apps like Telegram and WhatsApp.<br/>
<br/>
The feature is compatible with any third-party app whose settings include the "Use with Ask ‌Siri‌" option. To check if an app has the option, or to enable/disable it, follow these steps.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Siri & Search</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down to the apps list and tap the app in question.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle the switch next to <strong>Use with Ask Siri</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/siri-send-message-choose-app-ios2.jpg" alt="settings" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909292" /><br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/when-will-apple-release-ios-17/">When Will iOS 17 Be Released?</a></li></ul><br/>
If "Use with Ask Siri" is enabled for a particular app, you can manually choose it each time you ask the voice assistant to send a message. Here's how.<br/>
<ol><li>Activate Siri by saying "Hey Siri" or just "Siri," or by pressing and holding the <strong>Side button</strong> on your iPhone until the Siri orb appears on the screen.</li><br/>
<li>Ask Siri to send a message to one of your contacts.</li><br/>
<li>In the message card that appears at the top of the screen, tap the<strong> Messages icon</strong> next to the person's name.</li><br/>
<li>Tap another compatible messaging app in the dropdown to select it.</li><br/>
<li>Type your message in the input field, then tap <strong>Send</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/siri-send-message-choose-app-ios1.jpg" alt="siri" width="2860" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909294" /><br/>
<br/>
There's nothing more to it. ‌In iOS 17, Siri‌ is also able to recognize and respond to multiple back-to-back requests without needing to be reactivated.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/will-my-iphone-run-ios-17/">Will My iPhone Run iOS 17?</a></a></li></ul><br/>
You can, for example, ask ‌Siri‌ to tell you the time, and then follow that up with a request to text your friend that you're going to be late all in the same ‌Siri‌ request.

		<description><![CDATA[While rumors have been circulating about a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-pro-models-expected-to-be-more-expensive/">&#36;100 price increase</a> for both iPhone 15 Pro models, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce today <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20230908-11836.html">predicted</a> that the smaller iPhone 15 Pro will start at &#36;999 in the U.S., just like the iPhone 14 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Blue-Three-Quarters-Perspective-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907068" /><br/>
TrendForce believes that only the iPhone 15 Pro Max will cost extra. The research firm predicted that the device will start at &#36;1,199 in the U.S., which would be a &#36;100 price increase compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The device is expected to exclusively feature a periscope lens that enables up to 6x optical zoom, double the current limit.<br/>
<br/>
Despite predicting a price increase for the Pro Max model this year, TrendForce expects that the device will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/iphone-15-pro-128gb-storage-8gb-ram-trendforce/">continue to start with 128GB of storage</a>, rather than 256GB as previously rumored. On the other hand, the research firm expects both iPhone 15 Pro models to be equipped with 8GB of RAM, up from 6GB in the iPhone 14 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Time will soon tell if TrendForce is accurate with its latest predictions, as Apple will unveil the iPhone 15 series at its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">event on Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

<br/>

The research firm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/iphone-15-pro-8gb-ram-rumor/">reiterated its claim</a> that both iPhone 15 Pro models will be equipped with 8GB of RAM, compared to 6GB for the iPhone 14 Pro models. Increased RAM can contribute to improved performance, particularly for multitasking. The lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models will have 6GB of RAM, the research firm said.<br/>
<br/>
TrendForce believes the iPhone 15 Pro will start at &#36;999 in the U.S., just like the iPhone 14 Pro. However, the research firm predicts that the iPhone 15 Pro Max will start at &#36;1,199, which would be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/iphone-15-pro-models-rumored-to-see-price-increase/">&#36;100 price increase</a> compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models are expected to be equipped with a USB-C port and the Dynamic Island, while many additional features are rumored for the Pro models, including a titanium frame, customizable Action button, A17 Bionic chip, Wi-Fi 6E support, a periscope lens with up to 6x optical zoom on the Pro Max, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will unveil the iPhone 15 series at an event scheduled for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

		<description><![CDATA[Today on Amazon you can get Apple's AirPods Pro 2 at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.00</strong></a>, down from the original price of &#36;249.00. Amazon provides an estimated delivery date between September 9 and September 13 for most residences in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Red-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895408" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This has been one of the most consistent deals on the AirPods Pro 2 all year, and is about &#36;5 away from the all-time low price that we last saw in March. Given that we haven't tracked that rare sale again, we definitely recommend jumping on this deal if you've been waiting for a deal on the AirPods Pro 2.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 for &#36;199.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
This model of the AirPods Pro can charge via Lightning, Qi, or an Apple Watch charger. We're expecting Apple to introduce a model that adds USB-C charging to the AirPods Pro 2 next week, but it could be a while before those models are discounted.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The macOS 13.5.2, iOS 16.6.1, iPadOS 16.6.1, and watchOS 9.6.2 updates that Apple released today includes fixes for security vulnerabilities that Apple says may have been actively exploited in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903333" /><br/>
According to Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222">security support page</a>, in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, processing a maliciously crafted image could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing a hacker to gain access to the operating system with a simple picture. Apple fixed the ImageIO process by addressing a buffer overflow issue to improve memory handling.<br/>
<br/>
In iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS, a maliciously crafted attachment in the Wallet app could also lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple addressed the validation issue with improved logic.<br/>
<br/>
As these updates include important security fixes, everyone should install iOS 16.6.1, iPadOS 16.6.1, macOS 13.5.2, and watchOS 9.6.2 as soon as possible. Apple recommends these software updates for all users.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update</b>: As <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/">reported by Citizen Lab</a>, the vulnerabilities are part of a "BLASTPASS" exploit chain that was observed having been used in the wild to deliver NSO Group's Pegasus spyware. Pegasus is of critical concern to government officials, journalists, activists, and others with potentially sensitive information on their devices.<br/>
<br/>
The zero-click vulnerability allowed attackers to send a maliciously crafted PassKit (Wallet) image to a target via iMessage, infecting their device "without any interaction from the victim."<br/>
<br/>
The attacks can be blocked by applying today's updates or by enabling Lockdown Mode on your device.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/">iOS 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/">iPadOS 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/">macOS Ventura</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238">iOS 16</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239">macOS Ventura</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/ios-16-6-1-macos-13-5-2-active-vulnerabilities/">PSA: Make Sure to Update, iOS 16.6.1 and macOS 13.5.2 Address Actively Exploited Vulnerability</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-make-sure-to-update-ios-16-6-1-and-macos-13-5-2-address-actively-exploited-vulnerability.2400732/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[China earlier this week banned government officials from using iPhones and other foreign smartphones for work or from bringing such devices to their government offices, and now China is expanding the ban. According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-07/china-plans-to-expand-iphone-ban-to-some-state-backed-firms-in-blow-to-apple">Bloomberg</a></em>, multiple state agencies and state companies have started telling workers not to bring their iPhones in to their jobs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/iPhone-14-Pros-in-Hand-Black-Background-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1404" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-864576" /><br/>
The restriction is expected to expand to additional government-controlled organizations in the future as China aims to block foreign technology. China does not yet have a formal injunction, so it is not yet known how many companies may adopt the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> restrictions. China has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Government-owned_companies_of_China">huge number</a> of state-owned enterprises in power generation, seaport construction, mining, manufacturing, education, and investment markets. Foreign devices have historically been discouraged in sensitive agencies, but China is now taking a firmer stance.<br/>
<br/>
China is an important market for Apple, and the ban could push customers to purchase Chinese-made devices if they are unable to use their personal iPhones for much of the day. <em>Bloomberg</em> suggests that the strictness of the bans could vary from company to company, with some banning Apple products from the workplace and some preventing employees from using Apple devices entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Apple stock has been dropping since yesterday, and it is down over 5 percent as of Thursday.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/china-expanding-government-iphone-ban/">China Expanding Government iPhone Ban</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/china-expanding-government-iphone-ban.2400723/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week started selling certified refurbished 15-inch MacBook Air models through its online store in select European countries, as <a href="https://twitter.com/SaranByte/status/1699767645082390757">noted by @SaranByte on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter. So far, these countries <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/mac/2023-macbook-air">include the U.K.</a>, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Switzerland. Availability will likely expand to the U.S., Canada, and additional countries within the next few weeks.<br/>
<br/>

As usual for refurbished Macs, prices are discounted by approximately 15% compared to brand new models. A variety of configurations are available to order.<br/>
<br/>
Apple inspects, cleans, tests, and repackages all refurbished Macs to ensure they are fully functional and in good condition, and Apple's refurbished products are covered by a one-year limited warranty and eligible for AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the 15-inch MacBook Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/wwdc-2023-recap/">at WWDC in June</a>, with pricing starting at &#36;1,299 in the U.S. The laptop has the same overall design and M2 chip as the 13-inch MacBook Air, but it features a larger display and two additional speakers. The laptop is available in four color options: Midnight, Starlight, Space Gray, and Silver.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max will be priced at &#36;1,099 and &#36;1,199 in a &#36;100 price increase over the current models, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Pro-Colors-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-907572" /><br/>
In an investor note seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, Ives becomes the latest analyst to emphasize the expected price rises for Apple's Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, which have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-pro-models-expected-to-be-more-expensive/">widely reported</a> in recent months. He also reinforced previous reports that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and 15 Plus will maintain the same pricing as the current models.<br/>
<br/>
Ives believes there will be considerable promotional activities and discounts from U.S. carriers in the coming months. Such initiatives are likely to further drive sales for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, offsetting potential resistance from the price increment. He also highlighted that 25 percent of Apple's 1.2 billion user base has not upgraded their devices in over four years. This apparently indicates a significant pent-up demand that could lead to what Ives terms a "mini super cycle."<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-price-hike-iphone-15-pro-models/">contemplating raising the price</a> for both the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. Analyst Jeff Pu has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-15-pro-max-more-expensive/">also said</a> that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models could be more expensive than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> models. Most recently, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em>' Luke Lin noted the impending "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/major-price-hike-rumored-for-iphone-15-pro-models/">major price hike</a>" for Apple's upcoming Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models.

		<description><![CDATA[The UK government has denied that it has dropped a controversial plan to scan encrypted messaging services for harmful content as part of its Online Safety Bill, which is due to become law later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
A provision in the bill allows regulator Ofcom to order messaging services to use "accredited technology" to look for and take down child sexual abuse material. <br/>
<br/>
However, according to a <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/770e58b1-a299-4b7b-a129-bded8649a43b">Financial Times</a></em> report, the British government's minister for arts and heritage, Stephen Parkinson, said on Wednesday that Ofcom would only be able to intervene if scanning content was "technically feasible" and if the process met minimum standards of privacy and accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
Many security experts believe that such tech tools may never exist, while tech firms have argued that content moderation policies such as client-side scanning are impossible to implement without circumventing end-to-end encryption, which ensures that only the user and the person they are communicating with can read or listen to what is sent.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has threatened to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/20/apple-threatens-to-pull-facetime-and-imessage-uk/">pull services including FaceTime and iMessage</a> in the UK if the online safety bill goes ahead in its current form, while WhatsApp and Signal have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/whatsapp-signal-open-letter-uk-government/">said they will quit the UK altogether</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the government's apparent concession to tech companies' arguments, technology minister Michelle Donelan on Thursday denied that the bill had changed, arguing that if necessary it will still require companies to work to develop technology to scan encrypted messages if they cannot take action to stop child abuse on their platforms. <br/>
<br/>
Donelan <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/uk-minister-says-position-encryption-not-changed-2023-09-07/">told reporters</a> further work to develop the technology was needed, adding that government-funded research had shown it was possible, however she did not offer evidence to back her claim.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/">Encryption</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/uk-government-plan-scan-encrypted-messages/">UK Government Denies U-Turn on Plan to Scan Encrypted Messages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-government-denies-u-turn-on-plan-to-scan-encrypted-messages.2400680/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17, expected to be released in September, if you change your iPhone's passcode and forget it soon after, Apple now offers you a 72-hour grace period to fix it without getting locked out of your device. Here's how it works.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-passcode-green.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886806" /><br/>
In iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, it is now possible to reset an iPhone or iPad's new passcode with the previous passcode you used for up to three days after the change is made. In other words, Apple lets you use your old passcode within 72 hours of setting a new one, which is handy if you're someone who is likely to forget a newly created passcode.<br/>
<br/>
When you enter an incorrect passcode on a device running iOS 17 after making a change, simply tap on the <strong>Forgot Passcode?</strong> option at the bottom of the display to use the <strong>Try Passcode Reset</strong> option. Tapping it allows you to use your old passcode to create yet another new passcode.<br/>

For protection in case someone has learned your passcode, there is also an "Expire Previous Passcode Now" setting that you can make use of. (Note that if you use this option, you'll no longer be able to use your old passcode to gain access to your device if you forget your new passcode.) To use the new option in iOS 17, follow these steps:<br/>
<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and select <strong>Face ID</strong>/<strong>Touch ID & Passcode</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under "Temporary Passcode Reset," tap <strong>Expire Previous Passcode Now</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Expire Now</strong> to confirm.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/expire-previous-passcode.jpg" alt="settings" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909228" /><br/>
<br/>
It is still possible to change an Apple ID account's password with an iPhone's passcode, despite a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report in February highlighting instances of thieves <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/24/iphone-stolen-passcodes-report/">spying on iPhone users in public</a> when they enter their passcode, and then stealing the device in order to gain widespread access to the device. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi in June 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/10/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2023/">said</a> Apple has continued to "look at other ways to address this," but no changes have been made as of yet. To make theft harder, Apple recommends that users switch from a four-digit passcode to an alphanumeric passcode, which would be more difficult for thieves to spy on. This can also be done in <strong>Settings</strong> under <strong>Face ID & Passcode -> Change Passcode</strong>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/">Apple Security</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-change-your-new-passcode-if-you-forget-it/">iOS 17: How to Change a New iPhone Passcode If You Forget It</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-how-to-change-a-new-iphone-passcode-if-you-forget-it.2400676/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today sent out emails inviting developers to visit the Apple Developer Center in Cupertino, California for a workshop on app optimization. Apple says that developers can learn to maximize app performance to "give people a great experience."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Apple-Park-View.jpeg" alt="" width="1440" height="790" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-854420" /><br/>
Attendees will learn how to optimize Apple frameworks and what Apple tools can be used for identifying and resolving performance issues. Apple engineers will be on hand to provide support, app testing, and advice.<br/>
<br/>
The all-day event that runs from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time is set to take place at the Apple Developer Center on September 27, 2023. The event is free, and registration is first come, first serve. It is not clear how many spots are open to developers<blockquote>Join us for an all-day, in-person event and discover how to improve your app experience by maximizing performance. Learn how to optimize your use of Apple frameworks, identify and resolve performance issues with tools like Instruments and Xcode Organizer, and get advice from Apple engineers on reducing launch time, hang rate, memory footprint, and more. Plus, you'll have the opportunity to test your apps and get hands-on support. Hosted at the Apple Developer Center in Cupertino.</blockquote>Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/05/apple-developer-center-opens/">opened the Apple Developer Center</a> in June of 2022, just ahead of the 2022 Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple has described the Developer Center as a "world class facility" where developers can meet with Apple engineers, designers, and experts.<br/>
<br/>
There are dedicated lab areas at the Developer Center, along with work pods, briefing centers, a studio with stage, and more. Meeting rooms are named after prior macOS releases, and the studio room is named Big Sur.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of WWDC 2022 and 2023, Apple has extended limited invitations to developers to visit the Developer Center at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a>. The September 27 meetings will take place following the introduction of new iPhones on September 12 and after the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, which we are expecting to see released around September 20.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-developer-center-app-optimization-event/">Apple Invites Developers to Cupertino for Workshop on Optimizing Apps for Performance and Battery Life</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-invites-developers-to-cupertino-for-workshop-on-optimizing-apps-for-performance-and-battery-life.2400661/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 178 includes fixes and updates for Web Inspector, CSS, CSS Container Queries, JavaScript, SVG, Accessibility, Media, IntersectionObserver, Web API, and WebGL.<br/>
<br/>
The update now features content coming in Safari 17 alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>. On Sonoma, the browser offers Profiles for separating browsing data like History and Favorites, web apps, and improved private browsing mode. Features for all operating systems include Feature Flags (replacing Experimental Features), a redesigned Develop menu, Live Text support for vertical text recognition in images and videos, HEIC support, and JPEG XL, a new image format with an improved compression algorithm for better image quality at smaller file sizes than JPEG.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/">macOS Ventura</a> and &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, the latest version of macOS that Apple is beta testing right now.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-178/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 178 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-178-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2400656/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
