		<title>You Can Give Siri a New Name With iOS 18&#039;s Vocal Shortcuts</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> added a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features/">Vocal Shortcuts accessibility feature</a>, and now that &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is available in a beta capacity, users have figured out that this option can be used to give <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> a new wake word.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Siri-Integrated-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945741" /><br/>
With Vocal Shortcuts, you can assign a custom phrase that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can understand to launch shortcuts and complete "complex tasks," and one of the shortcuts you can set up is an alternative for "Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;."<br/>
<br/>
To set up a Vocal Shortcut for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, open up the Settings app, go to Accessibility, and scroll down to Vocal Shortcuts. From there, choose "Set Up Vocal Shortcuts," and select "&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;" (not &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Request). Type in the new name that you want to use to activate &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, such as "Computer."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/siri-vocal-shortcut-setup.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955565" /><br/>
Once your new name is set, you can say that name to activate &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Note that this is limited to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it does not sync to other devices like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> so you'll still need to use "&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;" for those devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/siri-vocal-shortcut-setup-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955566" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1dfeobg/ios_18_db1_vocal_shortcuts_can_be_used_to_trigger/">As noted on Reddit</a>, if you set this up, you need to pause to wait for it to activate before you give a command. With &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, you can say an entire phrase, like "Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; what time is it?" without stopping. That does not work with the Vocal Shortcut setup. You need to state the wake word, pause, and then give the command once the wake word has activated &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the delay, this isn't likely an option that most people are going to want to use permanently, though &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will still activate with "Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;" as well as the shortcut.<br/>
<br/>
Vocal Shortcuts can be used to set a voice command to run any shortcut, plus you can set up triggers for apps, system features like taking a screenshot, changing volume, scrolling, activating Control Center, and more. Vocal Shortcuts can be paired with a custom sound instead of speech, and it is a useful accessibility option aimed at those who need alternative ways to activate system features.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/ios-18-rename-siri/">You Can Give Siri a New Name With iOS 18&#039;s Vocal Shortcuts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-give-siri-a-new-name-with-ios-18s-vocal-shortcuts.2429243/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Sonos&#039; Privacy Policy Change Suggests It Might Sell Your Data</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular audio company Sonos recently updated its U.S. privacy policy to make a small but notable change that seemingly puts customer data at risk. As noted by Louis Rossmann (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178433/sonos-privacy-policy-customer-data-controversy">The Verge</a></em>), the new Sonos privacy policy removes a line about not selling customer data.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/sonos-roam-feature.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-792626" /><br/>
In the 2023 version of its privacy policy, Sonos had this sentence: "We do not and will not sell your personal data to third parties." The statement has been removed from the 2024 version of the privacy policy in the United States, though it is still present in privacy policies in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
The change to the privacy policy has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1desj5c/sonos_updates_tos_and_removes_clause_explicitly/">sparked commentary on Reddit</a> from Sonos customers who have become increasingly unhappy with the company in recent months. Back in May, Sonos rolled out a new app design that has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/sonos-said-rolling-out-widely-criticized-app-redesign-took-courage/">been widely criticized</a> for missing a long list of features like editing a song queue, managing playlists, shuffling a music library, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos users already unhappy with the app changes feel that the privacy policy update is another nail in the coffin for Sonos. From Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1desj5c/sonos_updates_tos_and_removes_clause_explicitly/">RemarkableAgent1350</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>What is happening at Sonos? This hurts to read, especially after all the app drama - and from a company that I loved. This just might be the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak. I think I'm done with Sonos.</blockquote><br/>
The removal of that line from the privacy policy doesn't mean Sonos is definitely selling customer data, and the company has not responded queries about what the change means as of yet.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/sonos-privacy-policy-change-suggests-it-might-sell-your-data/">Sonos&#039; Privacy Policy Change Suggests It Might Sell Your Data</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-privacy-policy-change-suggests-it-might-sell-your-data.2429242/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is giving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who find themselves in an emergency situation a way to provide more information and context to emergency responders with an update to Emergency SOS.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/emergency-sos.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955647" /><br/>
Emergency SOS now supports live video, which means once the SOS feature is activated, streaming video and recorded media can be sent to emergency personnel. Emergency dispatchers can send a request for a user to share either live video or a video from the camera roll, which Apple says should make it easier and faster to get help.<br/>
<br/>
Video is sent over a secure connection to the emergency dispatcher. The option could allow those in emergency situations to send key information for location purposes, to assess injury or risk, or to be used as evidence at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
Emergency SOS is a feature on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch that automatically calls the local emergency number and shares location information with emergency services. It is the backbone of the Crash Detection, Fall Detection, and Emergency SOS via satellite features.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/ios-18-gains-emergency-sos-live-video-support/">iOS 18 Gains Emergency SOS Live Video Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-gains-emergency-sos-live-video-support.2429240/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the Apple Intelligence features coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is Genmoji, which will allow <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to use AI to generate all-new emoji characters based on text input. The Genmoji will look similar to emoji, but are custom created, according to an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10220/">iOS 18 WWDC session focused on Genmoji</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Genmoji-iOS-18.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954516" /><br/>
Emoji are not images, but are instead pictographs that are encoded in the Unicode Standard and rendered by each platform. Emoji are added by the Unicode Consortium, which raised some questions about how Apple's Genmoji solution will work.<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, Apple has designed an NSAdaptiveImageGlyph API for Genmoji and also other images like stickers and Memoji, and this API makes them behave like emoji. It is powered by a standard image format in a square aspect ratio with support for multiple resolutions, and it is augmented with metadata. This setup means that Genmoji and other content using NSAdaptiveImageGlyph can be used with and formatted alongside regular text, similar to emoji.<br/>
<br/>
Genmoji can be used alone, copied, pasted, and sent as stickers. They can be used inline with text, and they respect line height and text formatting. Anywhere that can support rich text can support Genmoji, according to Apple. <br/>
<br/>
Genmoji are not Unicode and may not be appropriate for some data such as identifiers, phone numbers, email addresses, and will not be supported as widely as emoji. Prior versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, as well as apps that do not support rich text will denote Genmoji with a text description.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features like Genmoji are not yet in the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; developer beta, but Apple plans to let developers begin testing Apple Intelligence sometime this summer. Genmoji and Apple Intelligence will be available to the public this fall, but they will be limited to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads and Macs with M-series chips.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The Home app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> users who have more than one device that serves as a home hub to select which one should be used as the preferred hub. It is a small but useful change because it prevents &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; from choosing a hub that is further away from most &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; products or that has a weaker connection. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/homekit-showdown-2-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-826321" /><br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and earlier, there has been no way to select a home hub, and &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; has picked randomly. That can lead to connectivity issues in some situations. For those who do not care about which home hub &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; selects, Automatic Selection remains an option.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> are able to serve as home hubs, but the option to set a preferred hub seems to be limited to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; as of right now, because Apple has not yet provided a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; beta to developers. <br/>
<br/>

Other features coming in &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; include Customize Access for managing how and when people access devices like alarm systems, door locks, and garage door openers, with support for guest schedules. There's also a new Express Mode for unlocking door locks automatically as you approach, and support for robot vacuum cleaners is set to come later this year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to overhaul the design of its TestFlight app that is available to developers for beta testing their apps, and the updated design was highlighted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkeUvZ4NRhg">WWDC session on App Store Connect</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/testflight-redesign.jpg" alt="" width="2722" height="1531" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955569" /><br/>
TestFlight in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> features a new invitation experience that will better showcase the app by highlighting key information including app name and icon, screenshots, developer name, build expiration date, and app description.<br/>
<br/>
The refreshed design looks much more similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> than the current TestFlight interface, which provides little in the way of app data beyond the features that are being tested. Apple's current design assumes that testers are familiar with an app that they're invited to test, while the refresh provides key information to testers who might not be in tune with what an app is designed to do.<br/>
<br/>
Along with design changes, the new version of the app lets developers enroll testers that meet multiple criteria, such as specific devices and operating system versions. TestFlight will only allow testers that meet the criteria to accept a public TestFlight invitation.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet released the redesigned TestFlight app, but it will likely come at some point this summer or in the fall when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; goes live.<br/>
<br/>
Other changes planned for &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect include a Nominations option for developers to inform the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Editorial Team about new content for consideration for an &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; feature, and alerts when an app gets an &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; feature that include marketing assets for social media.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-connect/">App Store Connect</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/apple-redesigning-testflight-app-in-ios-18/">Apple Redesigning TestFlight App in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-redesigning-testflight-app-in-ios-18.2429234/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkafMX3viGE">Beats Solo Buds unboxing video</a> on YouTube, providing a closer look at the wireless earbuds before they launch next week.<br/>
<br/>

Priced at &#36;79.99, the Beats Solo Buds feature up to 18 hours of battery life, a USB-C carrying case, and Find My support on both iOS and Android. However, they lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery and can only charge the earbuds when a USB-C cable is connected to an external power source.<br/>
<br/>
More details about the earbuds can be found in our initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">coverage of the Beats Studio Buds announcement</a> back in late April.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 and tvOS 18 reintroduce SharePlay for Apple Music on the HomePod, HomePod mini, and Apple TV. The feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/">first appeared</a> in the iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4 betas earlier this year, but it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/apple-removes-shareplay-apple-tv-homepod/">was removed</a> before those updates were released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933114" /><br/>
This feature allows others to control Apple Music playback on your HomePod or Apple TV with permission, regardless of whether they subscribe to the service. The primary user can decide whether to approve or deny each request.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already rolled out a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/whats-new-carplay-ios-17/">similar feature for CarPlay</a> last year, allowing anyone in a car to control music playback via SharePlay with permission.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>HomePod</h2><br/>
While playing a song in the Music app on your iPhone, tap the SharePlay icon at the bottom of the screen to bring up a QR code, which another person can scan with their iPhone or Android smartphone's camera to request access to music playback controls. Even a screenshot of the QR code suffices for remote access.<br/>
<br/>
The feature works on both the HomePod and HomePod mini, and we could imagine the QR code eventually being shown on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/homepod-with-screen-delayed-next-year/">long-rumored HomePod with a screen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV</h2><br/>
With the tvOS 18 update, the Music app on the Apple TV can also show a QR code on the TV that guests can scan to request access to music controls.<br/>
<br/>
The expansion of this feature to the Apple TV and the HomePod is useful for house parties, allowing everyone to be the DJ.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18, tvOS 18, and HomePod software version 18 are currently in beta, and the updates will be widely released later this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shareplay/">SharePlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/ios-18-tvos-18-shareplay-homepod-apple-tv/">iOS 18 and tvOS 18 Reintroduce SharePlay for Apple Music on HomePods and Apple TV</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-and-tvos-18-reintroduce-shareplay-for-apple-music-on-homepods-and-apple-tv.2429222/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The European Commission plans to charge Apple for violating the Digital Markets Act after determining that the iPhone maker is not complying with obligations to allow app developers to "steer" users to offers outside of the App Store without fees, according to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/31a996d5-b472-4357-953e-ace078494604"><em>Financial Times</em></a>, which cites three people familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
It appears that the EU is taking issue with Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/">Core Technology Fee</a>, but the exact charges that it allegedly plans to bring against Apple are unclear.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could face non-compliance fines of up to 5% of its average daily worldwide revenue, which is currently just over &#36;1 billion, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
The report said the EU's findings are preliminary, so Apple may still have time to make any necessary changes on iOS before the charges are formally laid by regulators. In the event the EU moves forward with the charges, they would be formally announced by the European Commission over the "coming weeks," the report added.<br/>
<br/>
Apple made <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major changes to the App Store, Apple Pay, Safari, and more</a> on the iPhone in the EU as part of iOS 17.4 earlier this year. Apple now allows alternative app marketplaces, but it still charges a Core Technology Fee. Apple also introduced a default web browser selection screen in Safari, now allows third-party web browsers to use web engines other than its own WebKit engine on the iPhone, and now allows third-party mobile wallet apps to access the iPhone's NFC chip for contactless payment functionality.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/eu-plans-to-fine-apple-over-dma-report/">EU Reportedly Planning to Charge Apple for Violating Digital Markets Act</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-reportedly-planning-to-charge-apple-for-violating-digital-markets-act.2429205/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 includes a handful of enhancements to the Wallet app on the iPhone, with new features for Apple Pay, Apple Cash, event tickets, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Wallet-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955476" /><br/>
Below, we outline everything new for the Wallet app on iOS 18, based on information from <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/new-features-come-to-apple-services-this-fall/">Apple's press release</a> and a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10108/">WWDC 2024 coding session</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Redesigned Event Tickets</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/redesigned-event-tickets-in-Wallet-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955528" /><br/>
Event tickets have an all-new design in the Wallet app on iOS 18, complete with relevant info like a map of the stadium and other venues, local weather forecasts, recommended Apple Music playlists for concerts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Event Tickets as Live Activities</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Live-Activities-Event-Tickets.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955525" /><br/>
Event tickets now work with the Live Activities feature, so you can view your seating information on the Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island when you are near the venue. Live Activities also appear on the Apple Watch on watchOS 11.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Tap to Cash</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tap-to-cash-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954862" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/tap-to-cash-ios-18-pay-touch-iphones/">Tap to Cash</a> is a new iOS 18 feature that allows users in the U.S. to send and receive Apple Cash by simply holding two iPhones together.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Tap to Add New Cards to Wallet App</h2><br/>
A new Tap to Provision feature on iOS 18 will allow users to add eligible credit or debit cards to the Wallet app by simply tapping their card on the back of their iPhone. Apple says this feature will only be available in select countries.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pay in Any Desktop Browser</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Pay-Code-Scan-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955376" /><br/>
iPhone users who update to iOS 18 will be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-apple-pay-in-any-desktop-browser/">use Apple Pay in desktop web browsers beyond Safari</a>, such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others. The computer running the browser can even be a Windows PC instead of a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Any website that implements the latest version of Apple Pay will support this new system. When a customer checks out with Apple Pay in a desktop browser other than Safari, a code will appear on the screen that can be scanned in the Camera app on an iPhone running iOS 18 or later, allowing them to complete the purchase on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pay Adds Credit Card Rewards</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Pay-rewards-and-installments-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955527" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 18, Apple Pay will allow users to redeem rewards and access installment loan offerings from eligible credit and debit cards.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the details from Apple:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>The ability to redeem rewards will be available beginning in the U.S. with Discover and Synchrony, and across Apple Pay issuers with Fiserv.</li><br/>
<li>The ability to access installments from credit and debit cards will roll out starting in Australia with ANZ; in Spain with CaixaBank; in the U.K. with HSBC and Monzo; and in the U.S. with Citi, Synchrony, and issuers with Fiserv.</li><br/>
<li>Users in the U.S. will be able to apply for loans directly through Affirm when they check out with Apple Pay.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Card Data in More Budget Apps</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Card-FinanceKit.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955532" /><br/>
Apple has made its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/financekit">FinanceKit</a> API available to all developers, meaning that any finance or budgeting app will be able to display Apple Card, Apple Card Savings, and Apple Cash balance and transaction details with a user's permission.<br/>
<br/>
This feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/apple-card-ios-17-4-budget-apps/">debuted with iOS 17.4</a>, but it was limited to select apps like Copilot.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/">Apple Wallet</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/whats-new-in-apple-wallet-on-ios-18/">Here&#039;s What&#039;s New in Apple Wallet on iOS 18 for Event Tickets and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-whats-new-in-apple-wallet-on-ios-18-for-event-tickets-and-more.2429198/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After over a year of reports, there are now more than a dozen specific rumors about the features and improvements set to be offered by the two non-Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models later in 2024. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-14-vs-16-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-941488" /></div><br/>
While the upgrades that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; offers over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> will likely be at the center of Apple's marketing strategy later this year, many users are on two-year upgrade cycles, so the features introduced on both the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will stack up. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their two direct forerunners are listed below, using information from a range of reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
This guide focuses on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but to learn about how we are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro to improve on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">see our other comparison article</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to largely carry over the design of their predecessors. As a result, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will be a relatively significant evolution over the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌, featuring slightly rounded edges, a frosted glass back, and a vertical rear camera arrangement to facilitate spatial video capture. Other important design changes are expected to include the removal of the mute switch in favor of the Action button introduced on last year's Pro models and the introduction of an all-new "Capture" button.<br/>

For &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; users, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will offer many of the display upgrades that came to the previous generation, as well as a more efficient OLED panel thanks to micro-lens technology.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; introduced a major camera upgrade for Apple's standard smartphone lineup, bringing over the 48-megapixel camera of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro. With a number of other improvements such as spatial video capture, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; should be a significant camera upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;. <br/>

The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ in 2023, introducing a more modern design with the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, a USB-C port, and a 48-megapixel camera. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will build on these upgrades, offering the Capture and Action buttons, Apple Intelligence, and spatial video capture. With over 30 upgrades rumored to be in store, many ‌current &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ users will find upgrading to an ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; model worthwhile, if not essential.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to launch in the fall.

		<description><![CDATA[New <a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/file/240612EN3.pdf">legislation in Japan</a> requires Apple to allow third-party app stores and payment providers on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/apple-japan-new-year-promotion-2022.jpg" alt="" width="1614" height="944" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-831082" /><br/>
The Japanese parliament has passed the Act on Promotion of Competition for Specified Smartphone Software, a law that compels Apple to allow access to third-party app stores and payment providers on devices that run iOS. The legislation, which was passed by Japan's upper house and will be enforced following Cabinet approval within the next eighteen months, seeks to curb the dominance of major tech firms like Apple in the smartphone market.<br/>
<br/>
The law requires Apple to make several significant changes to its business practices. The company will have to permit third-party app stores on its devices, just like it does in the EU. App developers will be allowed to use third-party payment services. There are also provisions to allow users to change default settings via new choice screens during setup, such as for selecting a default browser.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will be forbidden from giving its own services preferential treatment in search results without a justifiable reason. The law also prohibits the use of data acquired about competing software to benefit its own apps. Additionally, the law requires that third-party developers have access to the same features as Apple's own apps and services, such as NFC for contactless payments.<br/>
<br/>
Failure to comply with these new regulations could lead to fines amounting to 20 percent of relevant turnover, with the figure increasing to 30 percent for repeat offenses. In a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177599/apple-google-japan-law-third-party-app-stores-competition"><em>The Verge</em></a>, Apple said:<blockquote>The Japanese government made a number of changes to the legislation that will help protect user privacy, data security, innovation, and our intellectual property. We will continue our engagement with the JFTC during the implementation period as we remain concerned about how the law will impact Japanese consumers and the secure and private iPhone experience our users have come to expect.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The law is expected to be fully implemented by the end of 2025. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> has already announced plans to bring Fortnite and its game store platform to iOS in Japan by late 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Japan's move follows a trend of international legislative efforts aimed at regulating the dominance of major tech companies. The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the UK's Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill are similar initiatives designed to foster competition and prevent monopolistic practices. Various antitrust cases in the United States are also targeting similar issues.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/japan/">Japan</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/japan-passes-law-to-allow-third-party-app-stores/">Japan Passes Law to Allow Third-Party App Stores on the iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/japan-passes-law-to-allow-third-party-app-stores-on-the-iphone.2429185/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has been gradually expanding its suite of satellite connectivity features for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> brings a significant new one in the form of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/you-can-send-texts-via-satellite-in-ios-18/">Messages via satellite</a>. The feature allows users to send and receive iMessages and SMS texts, including emoji and Tapbacks, while out of range of cellular and Wi-Fi networks.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v30z-0bGbHQ?si=aezmpIgfkSqxhKAL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<em>CNET</em> met up with Apple's senior director of platform product marketing, Kurt Knight, this week for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v30z-0bGbHQ">early first look at how the feature works</a>, while iJustine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZMqOATNXE">offered a similar walkthrough</a> of it.<br/>
<br/>
When your phone detects it's out of range of terrestrial networks, you'll get a pop-up alert that offers quick access to all of the available satellite-enabled services including Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and now Messages.<br/>
<br/>
Messages via satellite can also be accessed directly from the Messages app when off the terrestrial grid, with iOS popping up a card to help you point your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; toward an available satellite. From there, it works just as a normal Messages conversation does, and you're able to send and receive messages, emoji, and Tapbacks. Conversation messages sent via iMessage are also end-to-end encrypted when sent via satellite.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BZMqOATNXE?si=ja5yD4WiskPg-Vgq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
iMessages can be sent freely back and forth via satellite, but there are limitations on SMS due to the volume of promotional and automated messages that come through that protocol. Your emergency contacts and specified family members will be able to contact you via SMS at any time, but for all other contacts, you will need to send the first SMS message via satellite, which will then allow them to respond for a period of time.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, despite Rich Communication Services (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>) support coming in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; later this year, Messages via satellite will not initially work with &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;. Knight says the &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; protocol has not yet been optimized to a small enough size to work over a satellite connection, at least as far as Apple is concerned. <br/>
<br/>
As with Apple's other satellite services, Messages via satellite will launch initially only in the United States with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; before later expanding to other countries. Apple's satellite services work on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and later, and while Apple has indicated it will eventually charge for satellite services, it continues to offer them without charge for the time being.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/satellite/">Satellite</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-messages-via-satellite-first-look/">First Look at Messages via Satellite in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-look-at-messages-via-satellite-in-ios-18.2429147/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week previewed a new system that will allow iPhone users who update to iOS 18 to use Apple Pay in any desktop web browser, such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others. The computer running the browser can even be a Windows PC.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Pay-Code-Scan-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955376" /><br/>
Any website that implements the latest version of Apple Pay will support this new system. When a customer checks out with Apple Pay in a desktop browser other than Safari, a code will appear on the screen that can be scanned in the Camera app on an iPhone running iOS 18 or later, allowing them to complete the purchase on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Pay-Code-Scan-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955377" /><br/>
Apple provided more details about this system in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10108/">WWDC 2024 coding session</a> released today. It will take time for website developers to adopt the latest Apple Pay SDK, so this feature will not be widely available on the web right away.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Pay on the desktop web was previously limited to Safari on a Mac, so this is a much-awaited expansion of the feature to more browsers and devices.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is currently in beta, and it should be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-apple-pay-in-any-desktop-browser/">iOS 18 Enables You to Use Apple Pay With Chrome and More on Desktop</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-enables-you-to-use-apple-pay-with-chrome-and-more-on-desktop.2429140/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a few discounts across popular Apple accessories, including the AirTag and Apple Pencil. We're also tracking a few discounts on Eufy's own Bluetooth tracking accessories, the SmartTrack Link, which are slightly more affordable than the AirTag.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/airtag-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940079" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the AirTag, you can get the 4 Pack of trackers for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0932QJ2JZ"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;99.00. This is a solid second-best price on the accessory, and just about &#36;5 higher than the all-time low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0932QJ2JZ"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;19 OFF</div>AirTag 4 Pack for &#36;79.99</div></a></div><h2>Eufy</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/eufy-smartrack-link.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955367" /><br/>
<br/>
Anyone who needs a Bluetooth tracker but wants to save a bit of money should look at Anker's Eufy brand of trackers, which are on sale on Amazon right now and compatible with Find My on Apple devices. These start at just &#36;15.99 for one tracker and raise to &#36;48.99 for a 4 Pack.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple did not mention CarPlay during its WWDC keynote this week, but iOS 18 includes a handful of new features for the in-car software.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955334" /><br/>
Overall, there is not a whole lot new for CarPlay on iOS 18, with changes seemingly limited to the Messages and Settings apps so far.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap everything new for CarPlay on iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New for CarPlay on iOS 18</h2><br/>
<h3>1. Contact Photos in Messages App</h3><br/>
iOS 18 adds contact photos next to names in the Messages app, making it easier to identify conversations at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955330" /><br/>
The contact photos are also visible in Messages app notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-4.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955327" /><br/>
<h3>2. Silent Mode Settings</h3><br/>
In the Settings app, you can now choose to have Silent mode on your iPhone automatically turn on or off when the device is connected to CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-5.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955326" /><br/>
<h3>3. Color Filters</h3><br/>
Apple has expanded Color Filters to CarPlay. This accessibility feature can help individuals with color blindness to differentiate colors on the CarPlay interface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-3.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955328" /><br/>
There is a grayscale option and three other color filters available to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955329" /><br/>
<h3>4. Voice Control</h3><br/>
Voice Control is another new accessibility feature that allows you to control CarPlay entirely with Siri voice commands through a connected iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-7.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955324" /><br/>
<h3>5. Sound Recognition</h3><br/>
Sound Recognition is expanding to CarPlay to provide notifications for driving-related sounds, such as car horns and sirens. This feature can be especially beneficial to drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CarPlay-Sound-Recognition.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="718" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950848" /><br/>
We did not see Sound Recognition in the CarPlay settings on iOS 18 beta 1.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Update — June 14: Sports Score Card via Siri</h3><br/>
We found another feature after publishing: if you ask Siri for a sports score, it will now show a card on the CarPlay interface. This works for the NBA and NHL at a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/CarPlay-iOS-18-Sports-Siri.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955473" /><br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
Apple shared some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-next-generation-carplay-images/">updated next-generation CarPlay images</a> during WWDC 2024, revealing new Vehicle, Media, and Climate apps on the screen for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Next-generation CarPlay will be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to uniquely match their vehicles. Apple revealed a variety of different design options and layouts that will be available to automakers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-2.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954801" /><br/>
Automakers will be able to show custom notifications on next-generation CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple's website</a> continues to say that the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay will arrive in 2024, but it has yet to provide a more specific timeframe, and it did not provide any timing-related updates in its WWDC coding sessions.

<br/>

Monday's keynote event was insane, and jam-packed with an overwhelming number of AI features that are going to change the way we use Apple devices. We were able to visit the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> studio for the day just after the event to discuss what's in store. <br/>
<br/>
We take a look at Apple Intelligence, which is what Apple calls the AI capabilities coming to almost every app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>. Apple is focusing on practical tools that drastically improve the functionality of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, help you write and edit, and cut down on the little hassles in life. It's not all business, though, and there are some fun image and emoji generating tools that we go over, along with a surprising partnership with OpenAI that lets &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; loop in ChatGPT for requests. <br/>
<br/>
We also get into the new &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> design options, the revamped Control Center, and the features coming to Messages, plus we delve into the changes that Apple is making in &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>
