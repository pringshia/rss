		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to refresh the 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> as soon as 2024, so we could see a new model with an M4 chip before the end of the year. Apple is working to overhaul the entire Mac line with AI-focused M4 chips, &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; included.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-iMac-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946085" /><br/>
This guide includes everything we know about Apple's plans for an M4 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="m4_chip">M4 Chip</h2><br/>
The next-generation 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is expected to get the M4 chip, which is the same chip that Apple used for the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models. iMacs right now have the M3 chip, so the M4 will be a direct update.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 is built on the same 3-nanometer technology as the M3, but it is a second-generation chip with some speed and efficiency improvements. In a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/m4-ipad-pro-cpu-benchmark/">Geekbench benchmark test</a>, the M4 proved to be up to 25 percent faster than the M3 chip, which is a notable jump in performance.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 had a single-core score of 3,087 and a multi-core score of 11,702, while the M4 had a single-core score of 3,695 and a multi-core score of 14,550.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's M4 chip has a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, featuring six efficiency cores and four performance cores. There is a variant of the M4 with a 9-core CPU that Apple has used in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, but it is unlikely that this chip would be offered in the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Other Macs will get upgraded M4 Pro, M4 Max, and M4 Ultra chips, but the 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is an entry-level product on par with devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, so it will only be offered with the M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
Apple last redesigned the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; in 2021, and there are no signs that a new look is on the horizon. It's likely that the 2024 refresh of the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; will focus on the internals rather than any outward-facing design changes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/imac-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946010" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is an all-in-one machine that combines a computer and a display. It measures in at just 11.5mm thick, and has a slim profile that fits easily on a desktop. It comes in a range of bright colors, with a matching chin in a pastel color.<br/>
<br/>
So far, we don't know of any updates coming to the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; except for the M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="larger_imac">Larger iMac?</h2><br/>
There have been persistent rumors of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/imac-with-over-30-inch-display/">larger-screened iMac</a> that has a display that's around 30 inches in size, but that device was still in the early stages of development in mid-2023, and there is no word on when a larger &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; might come out.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/iMac-Pro-Mock-Graphic-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-877852" /><br/>
There is a possibility that we could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">see it sometime in 2025</a>, but it won't be coming in 2024. Apple this year will stick to the 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, as it has done since discontinuing the 27-inch model in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
Back in April, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that the 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; would likely see an M4 chip update "around the end of the year." Apple sometimes holds events in October or November when new Macs are expected, so we could see the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; around that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also expected to update the MacBook Pro models and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> before the end of the year. The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; was last updated in October 2023, so an October 2024 launch would come right at the year mark.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-imac/">Apple&#039;s M4 iMac: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-m4-imac-what-to-expect.2427321/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added refurbished <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro, and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max devices to its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/iphone/iphone-14-iphone-14-pro-iphone-14-pro-max">online store for refurbished products</a>, offering the prior-generation iPhones at a discount for the first time since their 2022 launch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/Apple-iPhone-14-color-lineup-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-888160" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; is available starting at &#36;619, the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro is available starting at &#36;759, and the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max is available starting at &#36;849. Apple does not have any available &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus devices at the current time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first released the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; models in September 2022, and has since discontinued the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max. These devices have been replaced with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models. Apple still sells the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus starting at &#36;699 and &#36;799, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
There are several configurations and colors of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro, and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max available for purchase. &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; models are available with up to 256GB of storage, while the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro models are available with up to 1TB of storage, with more of a discount available for the higher-capacity models.<br/>
<br/>
Stock will fluctuate over time as Apple refreshes the devices that are available, so you may need to check back if you're looking for a refurbished &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; in a specific color or capacity.<br/>
<br/>
All refurbished iPhones from Apple are unlocked and can be used with any carrier. Apple outfits refurbished <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models with new batteries, outer shells, and a fresh USB-C to Lightning cable, so they are basically identical to new in the box iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also offers the same one-year warranty on refurbished &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models that it provides for new devices, and there is option to purchase extended <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ coverage.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/apple-now-selling-refurbished-iphone-14-models/">Apple Now Selling Refurbished iPhone 14 Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-refurbished-iphone-14-models.2427309/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://astropad.com/">Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win one of Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, and an <a href="https://astropad.com/product/rock-paper-pencil/">Astropad Rock Paper Pencil kit</a> to go with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/rock-paper-pencil-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952167" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-2/">We've highlighted</a> the Rock Paper Pencil before, because it's the best way to mimic the feel of writing on paper with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. The Rock Paper Pencil is a screen protector and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; tip combo with a distinctly paper-like feel that you can't get from the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display alone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/rock-paper-pencil-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952168" /><br/>
When Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models came out, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-ipad-pro/">Astropad confirmed</a> that the Rock Paper Pencil works perfectly with the new tablets and the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro. The kit includes a removable screen protector in a variety of sizes to fit the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; you have, plus an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; tip that can be swapped out with the tip that comes with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2 or &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/rock-paper-pencil-3.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952169" /><br/>
The NanoCling Screen Protector is designed to attach to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display using static cling, so you can put it on and take it right off when it's not needed, with no adhesive residue to worry about. The Pencil tip has a wear-resistant copper alloy core and a palladium coating that is able to hold up to heavy daily use. It's designed to be equivalent to a standard 0.7mm ballpoint pen, which makes it ideal for note taking and sketching.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/rock-paper-pencil-4.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952170" /><br/>
Writing or drawing on an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; feels distinctly different from writing or drawing with a paper and a pen, and Rock Paper Pencil does a great job at making you forget you're using a tablet. It feels like writing on paper, and as a recent customer video montage demonstrates, it also <em>sounds</em> like writing on paper.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Feels like paper, SOUNDS like paper! &#x1f4dd; Rock Paper Pencil for iPad" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kc_JE1vIybI" width="486" height="864" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Astropad ships the Rock Paper Pencil with two pencil tips and a protective storage sleeve so you can store the screen protector whenever it's not being used.<br/>

Rock Paper Pencil is &#36;40 and you can <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/rock-paper-pencil">get it from the Astropad website</a>. The 13-inch version is compatible with the 13-inch ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ and ‌&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;‌, while there are separate versions for the 11-inch ‌&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;‌ and the 11-inch ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌.<br/>

<br/>

The new iPad Air does not have too many internal changes compared to the previous-generation model. Like the fifth-generation iPad Air, the battery cells continue to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/02/ipad-air-5-battery-pull-tabs/">adhesive pull tabs</a>, making them easier to remove.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit gave the 13-inch iPad Air a low repairability score of 3/10 due to the display and some other components being difficult to remove.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple once designed a Tetris clone called "Stacker," with the game featured on a prototype version of the third-generation iPod. <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT">AppleDemoYT</a>, known for sourcing rare prototype devices, shared images and a video of the unreleased iPod.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q0c6SOP4CCo?si=X19AhLdndRHKfeyN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The iPod in question is a "DVT" device, which means it was a mid-stage prototype that was still in "Design Validation Testing." It has a model number of A1023, which is not a known model number of any version of an iPod Classic, and had custom serial interfacing designed by an Apple engineer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipod-game-stacker.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952161" /><br/>
The third-generation iPod was manufactured in week 14 of 2003 (over a month before the release of the third-generation iPod), and it was purchased from an electronics recycler in China that sold it as is for parts. The device was non-functional when it was purchased, but was able to boot when the hard drive flex cable was replaced.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipod-3g-dvt.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952162" /><br/>
The iPod runs a prototype version of iPodOS 2.0, and one of the games is "Stacker." Stacker works a lot like Tetris, where the Tetris pieces are moved from left to right using the scroll wheel. Pieces fall when the middle button is pressed, and the idea is to clear more lines at once to rack up points.<br/>
<br/>
There are other games on the iPod, and all of them have placeholder non-release names, including Block0, Chopper, and Klondike. There's also a battery testing playlist on the device that has classical songs that play in a loop, suggesting Apple used this iPod to test the battery life of the third-generation iPod before it was released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipod-battery-testing-prototype.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952163" /><br/>
AppleDemoYT says that he asked "iPod godfather" Tony Fadell why the Stacker game was not released, and Fadell said that it was because games were added "with a later software release."<br/>
<br/>
Apple did add several games to the iPod 3G over time, including Brick, Solitaire, Parachute, and Music Quiz. In 2006, Apple released games through the iTunes Store that people could purchase for later versions of the iPod, including an official version of Tetris.<br/>
<br/>
Other games available through the iTunes Store included Bejeweled, Mini Golf, Mahjong, Zuma, Cubis 2, and Pac-Man, all of which pre-dated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/">Prototypes</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/ipod-prototype-tetris-clone/">Prototype iPod Features Apple-Designed Tetris Clone Called &#039;Stacker&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/prototype-ipod-features-apple-designed-tetris-clone-called-stacker.2427287/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpH7tDAlfLs?si=ngfe-8mBdrzuanw8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
We talk through first impressions of the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, including their pricing and the state of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup as a whole, giving attention to the reduced price of the tenth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, which now costs just &#36;349, which is &#36;250 less than the starting price of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>

<br/>
We also examine the recent wave of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">rumors</a> about the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 "Slim," an all-new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model expected to sit above the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro Max in Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup with a higher price tag. The device will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slimmer-iphone-17-major-redesign-rumor/">reportedly</a> feature a 6.55-inch display, a significantly thinner design with an aluminum chassis, an "A19" chip, 8GB of RAM, a rear camera array relocated to the center, a 24-megapixel front camera, and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera. Simultaneously, Apple is expected to discontinue its "Plus" model to make way for the "Slim," although it may not actually be called this when it debuts in the fall of next year.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Sonos just announced its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/hands-on-sonos-ace-headphones/">"Ace" over-ear headphones</a> with active noise cancelation, soundbar integration, a more lightweight design, and longer battery life, so we look at how they compare to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Another regulatory agency has approved Apple's new version of the Beats Pill speaker ahead of its official announcement (via <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/apple-beats-pill-speaker-comeback-taiwan-ncc/"><em>91mobiles</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/New-Beats-Pill-iOS-17.5-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949655" /><br/>
Following its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/beats-pill-fcc-database/">recent appearance</a> in the United States FCC database, the upcoming Beats Pill speaker has now been spotted on Taiwan's National Communications Commission (NCC) website. The device, carrying the model number A3211, matches the specifications seen in the FCC listing. Certification listings such as these are necessary steps before a product can be brought to market, and their appearance typically signals a launch within weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Images included in the NCC listing provide additional views of the new Beats Pill's design, which retains the familiar pill-shaped aesthetic of its predecessors. The front of the device is entirely covered by the speaker grille with prominent "Beats" branding. There are four physical buttons on the top and a USB-C port is located on the rear. The new model also includes a lanyard hole on the side. The device is expected to be available in three colors: Black, Gold, and Red.<br/>
<br/>
Basketball star <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/">LeBron James</a> and Formula 1 driver <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/unreleased-beats-pill-daniel-ricciardo/">Daniel Ricciardo</a> were among the first to be spotted with the new Beats Pill over the past month. These sightings were followed by the speaker's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-beats-pill-ios-17-5/">appearance in the iOS 17.5 Release Candidate</a>. While Apple has not officially announced the new Beats Pill, the multiple certifications and celebrity sightings indicate that its launch is almost certainly very soon. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/new-beats-pill-speaker-spotted-database/">New Beats Pill Speaker Spotted in Another Database as Launch Nears</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-beats-pill-speaker-spotted-in-another-database-as-launch-nears.2427283/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/cmjLeF4VvaB"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;300 OFF</div>15-inch M2 MacBook Air (512GB) for &#36;1,199.00</div></a></div><h2>13-inch M3 MacBook Air</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has requested OLED display panels designed for future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> models from its suppliers, <a href="https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/092/0002332359"><em>ZDNET Korea</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ipad-mini-3.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-818322" /><br/>
Samsung Display reportedly started developing sample 8-inch OLED panels for a future &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; last month, with plans to initiate mass production at its facility in Cheonan in the second half of 2025. The move is also apparently visible in Samsung's own supply chain in Korea. Samsung already supplies Apple with OLED panels for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, which features a tandem design for improved brightness and power efficiency. The report adds that Apple will bring an OLED panel to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> alongside the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; in 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's plans to move the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to OLED displays is now widely rumored. Research firm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-oled-roadmap/">Omdia</a> believes that the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will gain an OLED display in 2026, with the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; following in 2027, but Korea's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-plans-to-bring-oled-to-nine-new-devices/"><em>ET News</em></a> agrees with <em>ZDNET</em> that both models will be refreshed with OLED simultaneously in 2026, and there is a chance that Apple will delay bringing OLED to the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; until 2027. While the OLED ‌&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;‌ will retain an 11-inch display, the ‌&zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;‌'s screen may grow from 8.3- to 8.7-inches in size.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike Apple's latest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, which feature two-stack low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) OLED panels‌, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; may have single-stack low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) panels, meaning that they may be dimmer and continue to lack ProMotion.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week, some iPhone users reported that Apple's iOS 17.5 update had introduced a bug that caused old photos that were deleted to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-17-5-bug-deleted-photos-reappear/">reappear in the Photos app</a>. Apple quickly released an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-releases-ios-17-5-1-photos-bug/">iOS 17.5.1 update</a> to fix the issue, but for many users, its explanation of "database corruption" in the release notes was all too brief, and did little to allay concerns about the privacy of their data.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Green-and-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940351" /><br/>
Apple has now offered more details on the problem and what caused it. Speaking to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/23/apple-deleted-photos-resurfacing-explanation/">9to5Mac</a></em>, Apple reportedly said the issue had nothing to do with iCloud Photos, and the company never had access to the deleted photos. Rather, a corrupted database entry on affected devices was the cause of deleted photos reappearing. In other words, the deleted images that were restored resided locally and never left those devices. <br/>
<br/>
Apple said that in some rare cases iOS 17.5 had inadvertently restored files from the corrupted data and repopulated the Photos app with the deleted images. Apple claimed the issue affected a small number of users and a small number of photos.<br/>
<br/>
To explain reports that some restored photos were very old, Apple said that in some cases the corrupted data may have been copied from one device to another when restoring a local backup, performing a device-to-device transfer, or restoring an iCloud device backup (i.e. not involving iCloud Photos). <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/ios-17-5-bug-wiped-devices-photos-resurfacing/">One claim that was posted on Reddit</a>, which has since been deleted, alleged that the user's photos reappeared on an iPad that had been erased and sold to a friend. Apple said that this could not have been the case if the user had wiped the device prior to sale using the Erase All Content and Settings option found in Settings ➝ General ➝ Transfer or Reset. Either the user had not performed this necessary step, or the claim was false.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-releases-ios-17-5-1-photos-bug/">iOS 17.5.1 update</a> to rectify the issue does not remove any previously deleted photos that reappeared after updating to iOS 17.5. Affected users will therefore need to manually delete these images again, and they will be moved to the Recently Deleted album in the Photos app, where they will remain for 30 days. Recently deleted photos in this folder can also be immediately deleted by choosing Delete from All Devices.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/apple-explains-resurfaced-deleted-photos-bug/">Apple Sheds More Light on iOS 17.5 Bug That Resurfaced Deleted Photos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sheds-more-light-on-ios-17-5-bug-that-resurfaced-deleted-photos.2427262/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Device repair company iFixit is ending its repair relationship with Samsung, iFixit <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/96162/were-ending-our-samsung-collaboration">announced in a blog post</a> today. The partnership is being dissolved <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/31/samsung-ifixit-self-repair-partnership/">after a two-year period</a> because iFixit and Samsung have been unable to negotiate a new deal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/samsung-galaxy-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933041" /><br/>
iFixit said that it wanted to build a repair-friendly ecosystem for independent businesses and consumers with its Samsung Repair Hub, something that it has not been able to do. The company says it ultimately doubts "Samsung's commitment to making repair more accessible."<br/>
<br/>
Samsung used iFixit to facilitate a self-repair program for its customers, with iFixit offering step-by-step repair guides for replacing display assemblies, back glass, charging ports, and other components. iFixit says that there were continual obstacles working with Samsung, including the high price of components.<br/>
<br/>
Repair parts "were so costly" that customers ended up replacing their devices rather than repairing them. Batteries and screens, for example, were in pre-glued bundles and customers could not replace a battery without also swapping out the screen, which is a much more expensive repair. iFixit was also unable to provide parts to repair shops at prices and quantities "that made business sense," and iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens told <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/samsung/2024/5/23/24162135/ifixit-end-samsung-repair-parts-deal">The Verge</a></em> that Samsung limited iFixit to selling no more than seven parts per customer within a three-month period.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung never even shipped iFixit components for the Galaxy S23 series, the Z Flip 5, and the Z Fold 5, and has not sent anything since the S22 lineup launched. Samsung is instead selling components for its latest smartphones through Encompass. A <a href="https://www.404media.co/samsung-requires-independent-repair-shops-to-share-customer-data-snitch-on-people-who-use-aftermarket-parts-leaked-contract-shows/">separate report from <em>404 Media</em></a> gives further insight into Samsung's repair requirements, with a leaked contract suggesting that independent repair shops must give Samsung the contact information and other details of every customer that has a repair done. Samsung's contract also has a clause that requires repair shops to "immediately disassemble" any smartphone that has been previously repaired with aftermarket parts.<br/>
<br/>
Starting in June, iFixit will no longer be Samsung's designated third-party parts and tools distributor. Existing repair information won't be removed from iFixit, but iFixit also will no longer collaborate with Samsung to develop new repair manuals. iFixit plans to continue to sell parts and repair kits for Samsung devices using OEM parts when available as well as aftermarket components, which is similar to what it does for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> replacement parts.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung previously worked with iFixit to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50450/samsung-galaxy-upcycling-unlocked-smartphone-smarthome-project">announce a Galaxy Upcycling</a> program that ultimately never materialized, so this is iFixit's second failed Samsung venture. "We clearly didn't learn our lesson the first time, and two years ago we let them convince us they were serious about embracing repair," reads the iFixit blog.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit said that it "tried to make this work," but Samsung was profiting from unpaid work on repair guides. Ultimately, iFixit is "bummed" and won't let "one bad apple spoil the bunch." iFixit is <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations">still working with</a> Google, Valve, Lenovo, Motorola, Microsoft, and others on repair ventures.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung will likely bring more of its self-repair options in house, mirroring what Apple does. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/17/apple-launches-self-service-repair/">a Self Service Repair program</a> that was introduced in 2021, with Apple offering repair manuals and components so customers can do their own repairs.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/ifixit-samsung-repair-relationship-ends/">iFixit Ends Repair Relationship With Samsung</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-ends-repair-relationship-with-samsung.2427235/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular photo editing app Pixelmator Pro was today updated with an overhauled set of AI-powered masking tools that make it easier than ever to make selective edits. Masking was "reengineered from the ground up" in the new 3.6 version of Pixelmator Pro, so it's quicker to create and refine masks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/pixelmator-pro-hide-background.jpg" alt="" width="1488" height="837" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952158" /><br/>
There is a new Hide Background option that uses AI to nondestructively remove the entire background from an image with a click. The tool detects the subject of the image and adds a background mask to hide the rest of what's in the photo.<br/>
<br/>
Masking a layer or creating a mask from a layer can now be done with a double click on the canvas with the Arrange tool, and then there are controls available for resizing and repositioning the mask. Pixelmator says this makes it easier to do things like round image corners or crop individual layers in multi-layer compositions.<br/>
<br/>
Tools for refining masks are now located at the bottom of the screen whenever a mask is selected or created, so it's faster to adjust transparency, change edge softness, invert the mark, add a new mask, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Pixelmator has also gained support for vector masks, so layers can be masked into specific shapes. Adding a vector mask causes the area inside the vector shape to remain visible, while other areas are hidden. Masking a layer can be done by selecting a shape from the Mask menu at the top of the layers sidebar or creating a mask with the Pen tool. Vector masks are editable, so each point can be adjusted just like a regular shape.<br/>
<br/>
The new features are available for free to current Pixelmator Pro users. Pixelmator Pro is priced at &#36;50 and it can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/">Mac App Store</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Arc Search from The Browser Company was today updated with a new "Call Arc" feature that's designed to let you conduct a search in a gesture that mimics a phone call. To use the feature, open up Arc Search, raise the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to your ear, and ask a question.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eiRhBRVt_s" title="Call Arc | For questions on the go" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The gesture of raising the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to your ear activates the search option, and answers are provided verbally, so the entire voice-based search experience makes it look as if you're simply talking on the phone.<br/>
<blockquote>Arc Search now has voice-activated search, triggered by holding your phone to your ear and saying your query -- just like you're making a phone call. Upon using Call Arc, you'll instantly hear your search results, accompanied by an animated smiley face! You can also click "Read More" to access full Browse for Me results for each query.</blockquote>After asking a question, Arc Search will play hold music briefly before providing a verbal answer and standing by for another question. The interface of the voice search resembles a phone call interface with a smiley face, an end call option, and a "speaker" option to have results spoken aloud.<br/>
<br/>
Arc Search <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/arc-search-iphone-app-ai/">first launched in January</a> as search app that incorporates AI to present search results in a curated, easy-to-read format. It has a minimalist browser interface where users can conduct a standard search or use the "browse for me" option to get an AI-summarized list of results to a query, similar to what you might get from a Chatbot.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/arc-search-voice-search.jpg" alt="" width="5356" height="3013" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952153" /><br/>
Browse for Me is powered by large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI and others, and there's also a "pinch to summarize" feature that works with any webpage and an option to enable a reader mode to get rid of cruft on websites.<br/>
<br/>
Arc Search is available for free on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and requires iOS 16 or later.

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a> update that is set to debut at WWDC in June, Apple plans to rearrange "menus and app UIs," according to a report from <em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/23/system-settings-getting-shuffled-again-in-macos-15-among-other-ui-tweaks?utm_medium=rss">AppleInsider</a></em>. The System Settings app, which was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/macos-ventura-system-settings-app/">last updated with macOS Ventura</a>, will get one of the biggest updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/macOS-15-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942568" /><br/>
With macOS Ventura, Apple renamed the System Preferences app to System Settings, introducing a design similar to the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. System Settings in &zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj; is said to feature a new organizational system based on "priority and overall importance."<br/>
<br/>
The Notifications and Sound categories in System Settings will be moved lower in the list, with General settings moved up right under Network settings. Apple plans to move the existing Wallpaper and Displays sections into the same section with General settings, and Privacy and Security will be paired with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> and Password and other relevant settings. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Spotlight will be paired with Internet Accounts and Game Center.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also reportedly plans to redesign the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; menu bar icon, making a flat black and white icon to replace the current colorful icon, and there are said to be design changes coming to Calculator (a more iOS-like design) and Safari (a unified menu for page controls). Other rumored &zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj; changes include a Printable Account Recovery Summary option, a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> preference pane, and a "modern" user interface for AirDrop.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference keynote is set to take place on Monday, June 10, and it will see Apple unveil &zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, tvOS 18, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2, and watchOS 11.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/macos-15-system-settings-design/">macOS 15 System Settings to Get Design Overhaul</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-15-system-settings-to-get-design-overhaul.2427223/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Less than two hours after Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/20-inch-foldable-macbook-crease-free-rumor/">MacBook with either an 18.8-inch or 20.2-inch foldable screen</a> would launch in 2026, display industry expert Ross Young has said the device will indeed feature around an 18.8-inch screen.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Foldable-Screen-MacBook-Concept-Astropad.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952144" /><em>A foldable-screen MacBook concept <a href="https://astropad.com/blog/foldable-mac-screen/">by Astropad</a></em></div><br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1793657931910816161">post on social media platform X</a>, limited to his paying subscribers, Young said he expects the device to be equipped with an 18.76-inch display instead of a 20.25-inch display for "cost reasons." In a folded position, Kuo said an 18.8-inch MacBook would be similar in size to a traditional 13-inch or 14-inch MacBook.<br/>
<br/>
It is expected that a MacBook with a foldable screen would feature an all-screen design with a virtual keyboard, but exact design details have yet to be rumored.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said Apple is aiming to make the foldable screen "as crease-free as possible," and he said this could result in the device being nearly as expensive as Apple's Vision Pro headset, which starts at &#36;3,499. He also said the foldable-screen MacBook will be equipped with Apple's next-generation M5 chip, which has yet to be announced.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a foldable-screen MacBook is still a few years away, and Apple will firm up its plans for the device as its launch gets closer.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/">Ross Young</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/">Foldable MacBook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/18-8-inch-foldable-macbook-rumor/">MacBook With Foldable Display Will Actually Have 18.8-Inch Screen, Analyst Says</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-with-foldable-display-will-actually-have-18-8-inch-screen-analyst-says.2427206/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Tap to Pay on iPhone allows businesses to accept contactless payments on an iPhone, with no additional point-of-sale hardware like a Square Terminal required. The feature allows customers to pay by simply tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch, contactless credit card or debit card, or other contactless payment option on the merchant's iPhone. Payment is securely completed using the same NFC technology behind Apple Pay.<br/>
<br/>
Businesses in Canada can offer Tap to Pay on iPhone through iPhone apps offered by Adyen, Moneris, Stripe, and Square. In the coming months, Apple said Aurus, Chase, Fiserv, and Helcim will also offer the feature in the country.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said Tap to Pay on iPhone will be available at Apple Store locations across Canada, and at merchants such as Sephora, later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Launched in 2022, Tap to Pay on iPhone is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tap-to-pay/regions/">also available in</a> the U.S., Australia, Brazil, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Taiwan, the U.K., and Ukraine.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-launches-in-canada/">Apple Announces &#039;Tap to Pay on iPhone&#039; Now Available in Canada</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-now-available-in-canada.2427199/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Shoppers should note that at Best Buy, you'll need a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership in order to see the final deal prices.<br/>

<br/>
The most notable discount is on the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro (16GB RAM/1TB) for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX1NXX6Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,799.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,999.00 [<a href="https://howl.me/cmjldMyz4px">matched at Best Buy</a>].

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX1NXX6Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>14-inch M3 MacBook Pro (16GB/1TB) for &#36;1,799.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[LG is aiming to begin mass production of display panels for a MacBook with a 20.2-inch or an 18.8-inch foldable screen in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to information shared today by Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/space-black-mbp.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919458" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/apple%E7%9A%84%E9%A6%96%E6%AC%BE%E6%8A%98%E7%96%8A%E7%94%A2%E5%93%81-%E5%85%A8%E8%9E%A2%E5%B9%95%E6%8A%98%E7%96%8Amacbook%E8%AA%BF%E6%9F%A5%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0-apples-first-folding-product-the-full-screen-foldable-macbook-0a78c2772568">post on Medium</a>, Kuo said Apple is aiming to make the foldable screen "as crease-free as possible," which will require the use of high-cost components. As a result, he said the foldable MacBook could be nearly as expensive as Apple's Vision Pro headset, which starts at &#36;3,499. The 16-inch MacBook Pro currently starts at &#36;2,499.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo estimated that foldable MacBook shipments will exceed one million units in 2026, suggesting that the device will launch in around two years from now.<br/>
<br/>
He expects the device to feature Apple's next-generation M5 chip, which has yet to be announced.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo is one of three sources to have mentioned a 20-inch MacBook, alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/31/apple-foldable-notebook-2025/">display industry analyst Ross Young</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-20-inch-display-future-macbook-pro/">Korean website <em>The Elec</em></a>. However, there is no guarantee that the device progresses beyond the prototyping stage.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/">Foldable MacBook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/20-inch-foldable-macbook-crease-free-rumor/">20-Inch MacBook With Nearly &#039;Crease-Free&#039; Foldable Screen Rumored</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/20-inch-macbook-with-nearly-crease-free-foldable-screen-rumored.2427196/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Report: iPads Retained and Repurposed Much More Often Than iPhones</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> owners are more likely to keep or repurpose their old devices compared to iPhones, according to data from <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/apple-customers-also-just-hang-on">Consumer Intelligence Research Partners</a> (CIRP).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Fanned-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-869880" /><br/>
The data, covering the twelve months ending in March 2024, shows that 67 percent of repeat &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; buyers keep their old iPads or pass them on to family and friends. This is a notable contrast to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users, where only 41 percent keep or hand down their previous phones. About one-third of old iPads are handed down to family members or friends, compared to about 10 percent of old iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
This suggests that iPads, even when they are replaced, remain highly desirable and usable, which diminishes the urgency to upgrade to a newer model. This behavior contrasts with &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users, who are much more likely to trade in their old devices. Nearly half of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; upgraders trade in their previous phones, taking advantage of the secondary market and higher trade-in values. In contrast, fewer than 10 percent of &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; upgraders opt for trade-ins.<br/>
<br/>
23 percent of &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; upgraders report replacing their old devices due to loss, theft, or damage, whereas only six percent of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; upgraders cite these reasons. This indicates that iPads are frequently replaced out of necessity rather than a desire to upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/cirp-ipad-upgrades-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1127" height="827" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952052" /><br/>
CIRP's report also sheds light on the upgrade cycles for these devices. Forty percent of &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; users wait three years or more before upgrading, a figure that has steadily increased over recent years. This is in stark contrast to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users, who typically upgrade more frequently and are influenced by a much stronger trade-in market.<br/>
<br/>
These trends suggest that iPads continue to serve valuable roles within households even after being replaced by newer models. The secondary market for refurbished iPads appears to be much less developed than that for iPhones, possibly due to the high retained value that old iPads provide to their owners. While Apple may prefer customers to be motivated to upgrade to the latest models for their new features, the data indicates that many &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; upgrades are still driven by necessity rather than desire.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/">CIRP</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/ipads-retained-more-often-than-iphones/">Report: iPads Retained and Repurposed Much More Often Than iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-ipads-retained-and-repurposed-much-more-often-than-iphones.2427194/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
