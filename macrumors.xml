		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">"Scary Fast" event on Monday</a> at 5 p.m. Pacific Time, a regulatory database has potentially revealed at least some of the new products that will be announced, including new Macs and, dare we say it, maybe even a new iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Scary-Fast-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919318" /><br/>
Last week, two Apple suppliers resubmitted filings to a Chinese regulatory database for batteries used in existing Apple products, including the latest 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, Magic Keyboard for the Mac, and iPad mini, according to information discovered by <em>MacRumors</em>. All of the batteries had already been filed in the database in 2021 or earlier, and they were resubmitted last week with October 2023 issue dates.<br/>
<br/>
Resubmitted battery filings can hint at new products. Just ahead of the Apple Watch Series 9 being unveiled, for example, <em>MacRumors</em> discovered that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-battery-capacities/">Apple Watch Series 8 batteries were resubmitted</a> to the same regulatory database. Ultimately, the Series 8 batteries ended up being reused in the Series 9 models.<br/>
<br/>
The new filings list the same battery capacities as the original filings, suggesting that Apple's new products will not have any battery capacity changes. Longer battery life is still possible as a result of new chips with power efficiency improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects</a> the 24-inch iMac to be updated with the M3 chip, and the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad accessories for the Mac are expected to be updated with USB-C charging ports instead of Lightning. Apple includes the Magic Keyboard and the Magic Mouse in the box with the iMac. Gurman also expects updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
The interesting inclusion in the filings is a battery for the sixth-generation iPad mini, which could end up being reused in the seventh-generation iPad mini. Gurman last week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect">reported</a> that Apple was not planning to debut new iPads until 2024, and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo last month said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">new iPads were unlikely</a> to be released before the end of the year. The filing does not guarantee that a new iPad mini will be announced tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the sixth-generation iPad mini during its September 2021 event. The next model will likely be equipped with the A16 Bionic chip introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro, and it will likely have improvements to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">reduce so-called "jelly scrolling."</a><br/>
<br/>
Rumors about new iPads being announced earlier this month proved to be inaccurate. Instead, Apple announced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">lower-cost Apple Pencil</a> with a USB-C port in a press release. The new Apple Pencil will be available in early November, according to Apple, and new products announced at tomorrow's event could launch around the same time.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, our regulatory findings align with expectations of updated 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac models during Apple's event. Perhaps a new iPad mini will be part of the event, as well, but it would certainly be surprising given that Gurman and Kuo do not expect new iPads for the rest of the year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple won't update the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> until late 2024 and apart from fresh colors and USB-C charging, no other major changes are expected. That's according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-29/apple-to-unveil-m3-m3-pro-m3-max-chip-macbook-pro-imac-to-reignite-mac-sales-lobgrqad?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/airpods-max-spring-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-842859" /><br/>
Writing in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Gurman says Apple will replace the Lightning port for USB-C to comply with European regulations and for consistency across its AirPods lineup, but Apple does not plan to add the H2 chip and its attendant features like Adaptive Audio and Personalized Volume for the foreseeable future. <br/>
<br/>
Indeed, the next version of Apple's over-ear headphones will be so similar to the current models that Apple may not even change the generation number, similar to the USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
That said, Gurman adds that Apple's plans could "possibly" change between now and when the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are released.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/09/gurman-airpods-and-mac-accessories-usb-c-by-2024/">reported</a> that all three AirPods models and Mac accessories like the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad are likely to transition to USB-C by 2024.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/gurman-usb-c-airpods-max-late-2024/">Gurman: USB-C AirPods Max Not Coming Until &#039;Late 2024&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-usb-c-airpods-max-not-coming-until-late-2024.2409088/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is hosting an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">online streaming event</a> for the public and press on Monday, October 30, 2023 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. The company is expected to announce new Macs, and potentially other products during the event, dubbed "Scary Fast." Here's how you can watch it and when, depending where you are in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Event-October-2023.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919098" /><br/>
There are multiple ways to watch the October 30 event, with details listed below. We've also included a useful guide on when the event will take place in your particular time zone. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-october-2023-event/">What to Expect at Apple's "Scary Fast" Event</a></li></ul><br/>
Holding an event at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time is an unusually late time for Apple, and for most regions and territories east of London it will actually take place on the morning of Tuesday, October 31 -- or Halloween for many. So make sure you don't accidentally miss it because of the odd timing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Events Website</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events website</a>, you can watch the event live on a Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, PC, or any other device with a web browser. The Apple Events website works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and other main browsers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-events-website-october-30.jpg" alt="" width="1067" height="903" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918348" /><br/>
Just navigate to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">www.apple.com/apple-events/</a> using a web browser at the appropriate time to watch. You can visit the site now to add an event reminder to your calendar.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>YouTube</h2><br/>
Apple also plans to stream the event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=eN_kCGjo2wrffUee">live on YouTube</a>, which is perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to watch because the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=eN_kCGjo2wrffUee">YouTube live stream</a> can be viewed on every platform where YouTube is available, which is pretty much all platforms, from smartphones and tablets to consoles and smart TVs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=o4oqsu6j4sG-RroD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=eN_kCGjo2wrffUee">posted a placeholder for the October 30 event</a> on YouTube, and you can visit it now to set an event reminder.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV App</h2><br/>
Apple used to have a dedicated Apple Events app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, but ahead of WWDC 2020, it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/18/events-app-apple-tv-app-wwdc/">folded into the Apple TV app</a>. On event day, there will be a prominent &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app section dedicated to the live stream, which can be watched on any device where the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app is available.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/appleevents1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1112" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-746566" /><br/>
This includes the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, iPhones, iPads, and Macs, as well as select smart TVs, streaming devices, and gaming consoles. If you have an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app is one of the best ways to watch the event live. Apple hasn't updated the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app with the new event as of yet, but it should be added soon.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>When to Watch the Apple Event</h2><br/>
Unlike most Apple events, the company's "Scary Fast" event will take place at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Event times in other time zones are listed below.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has sent out Halloween-themed gift boxes to some influencers for them to enjoy while watching Apple's upcoming "Scary Fast" Mac-focused event on Monday night.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/gift-box-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919179" /><br/>
The gift boxes include a pair of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> headphones, an Apple cap, and a selection of "sweet and spooky" snacks and drinks. <br/>
<br/>
As shared by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lamarrwilson/video/7295111728801713454">influencer Lamarr Wilson</a>, the boxes also include an invite which reads:<br/>
<blockquote>It's almost Halloween and Apple has some treats in store for you.<br/>
<br/>
On the evening of October 30th, we'll unveil something special and invite you to join the online watch party.<br/>
<br/>
To make your viewing experience a bit more "spatial," we hope you'll enjoy immersive listening with AirPods Max, along with a few sweet and spooky snacks.</blockquote>Hints <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/alleged-macbook-pro-box-image/">suggest</a> the event will be all about the Mac, and the company is expected to refresh several Macs in the lineup with new high-performance (or "Scary Fast") M3 chips, including the 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/gift-box-apple-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919180" /><br/>
That said, given the unusual late timing of the event at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, not to mention the confusion surrounding the Mac lineup right now, this is one of the more mysterious events Apple has promoted in recent years, so we could well be in for some surprises.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to stream the October 30 event <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">live on its website</a>, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctkW3V0Mh-k">YouTube</a>, and through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app. For those unable to watch, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage on MacRumors.com and the <a href="https://twitter.com/macrumorslive">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/apple-event-gift-boxes-sweet-and-spooky/">Apple Sends Out Gift Boxes With AirPods Max and &#039;Sweet and Spooky&#039; Snacks to Promote Mac Event</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sends-out-gift-boxes-with-airpods-max-and-sweet-and-spooky-snacks-to-promote-mac-event.2409069/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

This week also saw lots of news on the software front with the public release of iOS 17.1, macOS 14.1, watchOS 10.1, and other updates, plus the first betas of the next round of updates led by iOS 17.2 with a number of additions and changes. Apple's services were also in the news this week due to major price increases, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What to Expect at Apple's October 30 'Scary Fast' Event</h2><br/>
Surprise! Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">announced that it will be holding another event on Monday, October 30</a> at the unusual time of 5 p.m. Pacific Time. The event has a "Scary Fast" tagline, which is a reference to Halloween and likely also new Macs with faster Apple silicon chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/What-to-Expect-at-Apples-Scary-Fast-Event-Thumb-1-nopro.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919129" /><br/>
Apple has made it clear that the event will be focused on the Mac, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-scary-fast-event-livestream/">the event's page</a> features an animation depicting the Finder app icon from the Mac. As usual, we've put together a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-october-2023-event/">guide outlining what we're expecting to see</a> (plus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/what-not-to-expect-apple-october-event/">what we're not expecting to see</a>) at the event, with new iMac and MacBook Pro models headlining the list.<br/>
<br/>
The "Scary Fast" event will be streamed on Apple.com <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-scary-fast-event-livestream/">and on YouTube</a>, with no in-person component at Apple Park.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+ Get Significant Price Increases</h2><br/>
Apple this week announced that it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">increasing the prices of some of its subscription-based services</a>, including Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+, for new and existing subscribers in the U.S. and select other countries around the world.<br/>
<br/>

Notably, Apple TV+ now costs &#36;9.99 per month in the U.S., up from &#36;6.99 per month. For existing subscribers, this change will take effect in 30 days.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>New AirPods and AirPods Max Launching in 2024, Updated AirPods Pro Coming in 2025</h2><br/>
Apple plans to begin a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/airpods-lineup-overhaul-2024/">major overhaul of its AirPods lineup</a> starting next year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airpods-school.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905460" /><br/>
The standard AirPods will see two new models in late 2024 with and without Active Noise Cancelation, while AirPods Max updates in a similar timeframe will primarily be limited to new colors and a shift to USB-C. New AirPods Pro with updated designs for the earbuds and the case and improved audio quality should arrive in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pay Later Officially Launches in U.S. Following Early Access Period</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">upcoming "Scary Fast" event</a> takes place on October 30 (or 31, depending where you are) when it is expected to unveil new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, and a new 24-inch iMac. It may also make some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">additional new products available</a>, but there are a handful of rumored upcoming devices that we don't expect to make an appearance this month.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919162" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/scary-fast-what-not-to-expect.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
To help set expectations ahead of Apple's October event, we've compiled a list of products that Apple is unlikely to announce during "Scary Fast," but rather next year and beyond.<br/>
<h2 id="m3_13-inch_macbook_pro">M3 13-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Apple is developing new Macs powered by the company's next-generation M3 chip, which is built on chipmaking partner TSMC's 3nm process, resulting in significant performance and power efficiency improvements over the 5nm-based M2 chip that Apple's most recent Mac models are based on.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850662" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/13-inch-macbook-pro-2022-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1100" height="619" /><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman, Apple has M3-based versions of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models ready to go, but a new version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro featuring the M3 chip is looking increasingly less likely to appear alongside them at Apple's "Scary Fast" event.<br/>
<br/>
As recently as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/">last week</a>, Gurman said that supplies of the 13-inch MacBook Pro were running low, indicating that it could be replaced at the end of the month. But he now says that the new machine likely won't appear at Apple's upcoming event.<br/>
<br/>
"While the company has been working on a low-end MacBook Pro codenamed J504 with a base version of the M3 chip, that machine likely won't appear Monday," Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/m3-13-inch-macbook-pro-unlikely-to-be-at-event/">reported for <em>Bloomberg</em> on Friday</a>.<br/>
<h2 id="m3_13-inch_and_15-inch_macbook_air">M3 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Apple has not updated the smaller 13-inch MacBook Air so far this year. The current M2-powered model was originally announced in June 2022, so it was hoped that there would be a refresh soon. Indeed, in June 2023, Gurman claimed the 13-inch MacBook Air could be one of the first beneficiaries of Apple's new M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909564" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/13inch-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
However, more recently he has said that a 13-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip has only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/four-new-macbooks-on-schedule-for-launch-in-2024/">just reached engineering verification testing (EVT)</a>, an earlier production testing phase on prototype devices. Gurman says this puts the next-generation 13-inch MacBook Air on schedule for launch between the spring and summer of next year at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the 15-inch MacBook Air in June this year, and so it is not expected to be amongst the first generation of M3-powered Macs.<br/>
<h2 id="mac_pro_mac_studio_mac_mini">Mac Pro, Mac Studio, Mac Mini</h2><br/>
Likewise, Apple this year has already updated the Mac Pro and Mac Studio. These updates were also released in June 2023, so there is little chance that they will be superseded by newer models before 2024. Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/">maintains</a> that Apple will not refresh the MacBook Air models, Mac Studio, or Mac Pro at this time.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Mac mini, Apple updated the machine with M2 chips in January 2023, while M3-powered models are not expected to emerge until late 2024 at the earliest, according to Gurman.<br/>
<h2 id="new_ipads">New iPads</h2><br/>
Apple sometimes releases new iPads towards the end of the year, but there is increasing skepticism about that happening in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is widely believed to be working on new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">M3-powered iPad Pro models with OLED displays</a> and a redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory, but these devices are not expected to debut until the spring or early summer of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907943" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPad-mini-AND-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The same goes for the iPad mini, which was last updated in September 2021. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in January said the next model would likely enter mass production in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/new-ipad-mini-launching-next-year/">first quarter of 2024</a>. At the time, he also said there may be no new iPad releases in the following 9-12 months, and he has since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/no-new-macs-or-ipads-expected-rest-of-2023/">doubled down</a> on this prediction.<br/>
<br/>
According to Gurman, Apple is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/new-ipad-air-reportedly-in-development/">developing a new iPad Air</a> with improved specs, but he no longer believes it will arrive this year. Apple last updated the iPad Air in March 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869882" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Fanned-Pink.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Apple is also working on an 11th-generation entry-level iPad. The 10th-generation iPad was released in October 2022, and Apple has updated the entry-level iPad on an annual basis since 2017, but there are no rumors suggesting it will debut in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The Mac focus of Apple's "Scary Fast" event doesn't completely rule out new iPads from Apple this year, as Apple could conceivably choose to release new models in November via press release instead, like it did in January 2023 for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro and the second-generation HomePod. But neither <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/no-new-macs-or-ipads-expected-rest-of-2023/">Kuo</a> nor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/m3-13-inch-macbook-pro-unlikely-to-be-at-event/">Gurman</a> believe that any iPads are going to arrive before spring 2024 at the earliest.<br/>
<h2 id="iphone_se_4">iPhone SE 4</h2><br/>
Rumors regarding Apple's plans for the next-generation iPhone SE have been mixed at best, with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/13/iphone-se-4-rumors/">lot of back and forth</a> on when and indeed if we'll see a fourth-generation iPhone SE.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyoWyvk6esk?si=f2dppNeeAK-qsPOa" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/iphone-se-4-to-feature-action-button-and-more/">latest rumors suggest</a> the iPhone SE will be similar to the iPhone 14, featuring an all-display design with Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, a single rear camera, and an "Action" button to replace the mute switch. There's also a possibility that it could include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/suppliers-bidding-on-iphone-se-4-displays/">OLED display technology</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We are not expecting a new iPhone SE to debut this year or even next year, and it's looking like it will launch in 2025 at the earliest. It could perhaps be one of the first devices to feature an Apple-designed modem chip.<br/>
<h2 id="vision_pro_headset">Vision Pro Headset</h2><br/>
Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the so-called "spatial computing" device announced at WWDC 2023 in June.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
According to Apple, the Vision Pro will go on sale in early 2024, which likely means January to late April, with an outside chance of it arriving in May.<br/>
<h2 id="airpods_lineup">AirPods Lineup</h2><br/>
Apple is planning a major overhaul of its AirPods lineup, but that is not expected to start until next year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/airpods-lineup-overhaul-2024/">according to Gurman</a>. The standard AirPods and the AirPods Max will see a refresh in 2024, while the AirPods Pro will be updated in 2025. For the AirPods and AirPods Pro, Apple will update the design of the earbuds and the case, while also improving audio quality.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905460" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airpods-school.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
There is no clear word yet on when in 2024 and 2025 we might see AirPod refreshes, but Apple typically introduces new models in the latter half of the year around when new iPhones come out. Gurman says that the AirPods will come out "later next year" and the AirPods Max will come out "around the end of next year."<br/>
<h2 id="homepod_lineup">HomePod Lineup</h2><br/>
Lastly, HomePod. Apple's HomePod mini is now three years old. Gurman was first to highlight Apple's work on a second-generation HomePod mini in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/07/new-homepod-mini-and-high-end-homepod/">August 2022</a>. In February, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple will begin mass shipments of the second-generation HomePod mini in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/homepod-mini-2-shipping-next-year/">second half of 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904091" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/HomePod-Mini-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
It is also possible that Apple could wait to introduce a new HomePod mini until the debut of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/21/images-show-new-homepod-with-screen/">third-generation full-size HomePod</a>, especially if it includes new features. Apple is said to be developing an updated version of the HomePod that will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">feature a 7-inch display</a> and arrive in 2024, according to Ming-Chi Kuo. Gurman also believes Apple has a HomePod with a screen in development, but he does not expect it to come out until <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/homepod-with-screen-delayed-next-year/">next year at the earliest</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/what-not-to-expect-apple-october-event/">What Not to Expect at Apple&#039;s &#039;Scary Fast&#039; October 30 Event</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-not-to-expect-at-apples-scary-fast-october-30-event.2408994/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple earlier this week surprised us with an unexpected October event, and curiously, it is set to take place on Monday, October 30 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Apple has never hosted a nighttime event before, so Monday should be quite interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vvQEWR12rtU?si=ytzTKLh93Pghkw2m" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The "Scary Fast" event will be focused on the Mac, which has been confirmed by Apple's artwork for the event. On Apple's website, there is an Apple logo that morphs into the Mac Finder icon, so it's Macs that we're going to see.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors have been mixed about what we can expect at the event, but it's sounding like we'll get the entire M3 chip lineup. We've outlined what we've heard is coming, but we might also get some unexpected announcements.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="14-inch_and_16-inch_macbook_pro">14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models were updated with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips in January 2023, so it is early for an update, but it is not unheard of for Apple to refresh a Mac twice in a single year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/macbook-pro-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893124" /><br/>
Apple is expected to update the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with its next-generation M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, which will come less than a year after Apple debuted the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
The base M3 Pro chip will have a 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU, with upgrades available for a 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU. The base M3 Max chip will have a 16-core GPU and a 32-core GPU, with an option to upgrade to a 40-core GPU.<br/>
<br/>
Upgrading from &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro/&zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max to M3 Pro and M3 Max should bring notable performance improvements, especially when it comes to the GPU and the ability for the MacBook Pro to run high-end games.<br/>
<br/>
There was a recent rumor from <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> suggesting that the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will get more power-efficient miniLED displays, so there is a chance that we'll also see tweaks to display performance.<br/>
<br/>
If we get the M3 upgrade and a new miniLED display, the MacBook Pro models could have significant improvements to their battery life. Aside from the new chips and the possible new display, we are not expecting any other design changes for the MacBook Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="imac">iMac</h2><br/>
Apple hasn't refreshed the 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> since 2021, and it's still using the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is expected to get an update at Apple's event, and the new version will use the M3 chip, the same chip that will be in the 13-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-M3-Blue-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917291" /><br/>
Jumping from &zwnj;M1&zwnj; to M3 will improve both CPU and GPU performance, but most notably the GPU performance. The M3 chip supports more RAM, so we could see more maximum memory available with an update, as well as a higher-capacity SSD.<br/>
<br/>
There won't be notable design changes to the display of the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> believes that Apple will tweak the stand. Some of the internal components in the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; will be relocated and redesigned, with a new manufacturing process used to attach the stand.<br/>
<br/>
An upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E is likely, as is Bluetooth 5.3. These are technologies that have been introduced in other Macs over the last year. The M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is reportedly being tested in orange, blue, pink, and silver finishes, so we should see some of the same color options that were available with the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="usb-c_accessories">USB-C Accessories</h2><br/>
Apple is expected to eliminate the Lightning port in several of its Mac accessories, including the Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard. Instead of Lightning, these devices will adopt a USB-C port as part of Apple's transition to USB-C across its entire product lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/magic-mouse-2-lightning.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-835832" /><br/>
<h2 id="other_possibilities">Other Possibilities</h2><br/>
Aside from the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; and refreshed 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, there are no other rumors that suggest other devices are getting updated. <br/>
<br/>
Initial information indicated that the 13-inch MacBook Pro could see a refresh with an M3 chip, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/m3-13-inch-macbook-pro-unlikely-to-be-at-event/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> has since confirmed the 13-inch MacBook Pro will be refreshed at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
Other Macs, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> won't be updated until 2024, and the same goes for the iPads and AirPods. We are not expecting new iPads or new versions of the AirPods until next year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="how_to_watch">How to Watch</h2><br/>
Apple's "Scary Fast" event begins at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Monday, October 30.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to try out the software ahead of its release. The public iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 betas come a day after Apple released the betas for developers.<br/>
<br/>

Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta.

<br/>
iOS 17.2 adds the Journal app designed to let <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users record their daily activities and thoughts. Apple offers prompts that can be used as inspiration, and journal entires can be outfitted with images, voice recordings, location tags, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Collaborative playlists are now available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> so you can create playlists that multiple people contribute to, and there's also now a Favorites playlist that has all the music you've favorited. Stickers can be used as tapback reactions in the Messages app, the Action Button on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models can now be set to a new Translate function, and Apple has implemented support for iMessage Contact Key Verification.<br/>
<br/>
There are new Weather and Clock widgets, tweaks to the TV app, updates to Message syncing across devices, new Memoji options, and more, with the full list of features we've found so far available in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">iOS 17.2 beta features article</a>.<br/>

Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.2 adds Messages sticker reactions, which make it quicker to add a sticker or an emoji to an iMessage. It also includes support for collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists, allowing multiple people to add songs to a single playlist. <br/>

We're tracking another similar <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/sonos-early-black-friday-sale/">early Black Friday sale at Sonos</a>.<br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qu3eAzqRywQ?si=EEp0ff4sM_vaiur9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
We talk through the unusual nature of the event, with Apple announcing it less than one week in advance, opting for an unorthodox 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time start, and even offering an explicit nod to the arrival of new Macs with a Finder easter egg. The event is expected to see the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/">debut of the M3 chip</a> and some of its more powerful variants. Two Mac models are currently in the running to be announced, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and high-end MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/">rumored to be on the table</a>. We also discuss our feelings about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> as we approach three years since their introduction and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 256GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max from Apple. For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">GRID Studio</a>, the company takes old, discarded Apple devices and turns them into clever artwork.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-1.jpg" alt="" width="1348" height="759" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919076" /><br/>
Each of GRID Studio's pieces features a deconstructed Apple device with the components laid out underneath a glass frame. There are labels for each part, along with interesting and relevant historical facts and details.<br/>
<br/>
One of GRID Studio's most popular offerings is the GRID 1, <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">priced at &#36;400</a>. The GRID 1 features the original Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> from 2007, highlighting the components that made up what has become the most popular smartphone in the world. The iconic original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; casing is positioned next to the power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components, and this is before the days where Apple started making its own chips.<br/>
<br/>
The GRID 4, <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/framed-iphone-4">available for just &#36;99</a>, is another great piece of Apple history. It highlights the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4, which is the first major redesign that Apple came out with. The GRID 4 includes the popular square-style frame that dictated several generations of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; design.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-iPhone4.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919077" /><br/>
GRID Studio's <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-5">&#36;139 GRID 5</a> shows off the internal components from the 2012 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 is notable because it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that was developed under Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, and the last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple CEO Steve Jobs was directly involved with. Compared to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4s, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 brought a taller 4-inch display and it was also the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to feature a Lightning port.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-iPhone-5.jpg" alt="" width="1816" height="1022" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919078" /><br/>
For Apple Watch fans, GRID Studio has the <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/apple-watch-series-0">&#36;199 GRID Watch 1st Gen</a>, which features the components from the first Apple Watch that Apple released in April 2015. Apple Watches today still use the same design that Apple introduced with the original model, though the display has grown and the bezels have been slimmed down. The original Apple Watch included the S1 chip, Apple's first system-on-a-chip, and the first Apple Watch heart rate sensor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-APPLE-WATCH.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919079" /><br/>
In addition to art pieces featuring torn-apart devices, GRID Studio also sells a range of fun t-shirts that are aimed at Apple fans. The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-command-t-shirt">&#36;39 GRID Command t-shirt</a>, for example, features the command key design recreated with a series of rainbow Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Command-Tshirt.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919081" /><br/>
Now is a good time to check out the <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/">GRID Studio website</a> because the company is hosting its autumn sale. From October 27 to October 29, the GRID 4 is available for &#36;99, while all Apple A-series mobile processor artwork is priced at &#36;79. All other items are available at a 15 percent discount with the promo code A15.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Beats brand is announcing a new collaboration today with EA SPORTS FC and star footballer Erling Haaland, which involves a new ad and multiple in-game Beats integrations for <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-24">EA SPORTS FC 24</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClORGJ4Ed7Q?si=KTf21t6uLJEXkX-n" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The new ad featuring Haaland was built using EA's Frostbite game engine to remix scenes of Haaland from the recent Beats ad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuUXiJW2HjY">"The King & The Viking"</a> featuring Haaland and NBA legend LeBron James.<br/>
<br/>
Under the new partnership, users who play EA SPORTS FC 24 by November 1 will receive Founder status in the game with access to exclusive in-game rewards such as a permanent Erling Haaland item in Ultimate Team mode and custom digital Beats Studio Pro in a Haaland-inspired Viking theme.<br/>
<br/>

And coming in December, FC 24 Player Career mode will add the ability for users to purchase additional virtual Beats headphones from their in-game salaries to earn Personality Points that enhance their on-field performance. As players advance through the mode, they'll be able to become Beats Ambassadors for additional salary and other benefits, while Manager Career mode will allow users to outfit their teams with Beats-inspired kits.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/beats-ea-sports-fc-collab/">Beats Teams Up With EA SPORTS FC for New Ad Campaign and Exclusive Game Benefits</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-teams-up-with-ea-sports-fc-for-new-ad-campaign-and-exclusive-game-benefits.2408890/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Halloween is just a few days away, and in anticipation of the holiday we're tracking multiple sales and promotions on Apple-related accessories from retailers like Sonos, Belkin, Hyper, Best Buy, and many more.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Best Apple Deals</h2><br/>
In addition to accessories, we're tracking a few discounts on Apple products like the iPad, iPad Air, AirPods, and Apple Watch Ultra. All of the devices in the list below can be found on Amazon (with the exception of the HomePod at B&H Photo), and none require coupon codes in order to see their discounts.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">9th Gen iPad</a> - &#36;249.00, down from &#36;329.00</li><br/>

<br/>
<h2>MacBook Air Deals</h2><br/>
Amazon and Best Buy are hosting quite a few all-time low prices on nearly every MacBook Air this weekend. Specifically, you'll find record low prices on the 15-inch MacBook Air, 13.6-inch MacBook Air, and 13.3-inch MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/macbook-halloween.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919017" /><br/>

The highlights of the sale include the 27-inch ViewFinity S9 5K Display at &#36;300 off and the Smart Monitor M8 at &#36;200 off.<br/>

Starting with the newer 27-inch ViewFinity S9 5K Display, this monitor is available for <a href="https://howl.me/ckxOKKNxdNh"><strong>&#36;1,299.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.99. This is a match of the all-time low price on the device, which we last tracked around Prime Day, and you'll find the same price <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-ViewFinity-Thunderbolt-DisplayPort-LS27C900PANXZA%2Fdp%2FB0CB71BY87">on Amazon</a>.<br/>

<br/>
The ViewFinity S9 is a 27-inch display with a Thunderbolt 4 port, three USB-C ports, and a Mini DisplayPort, and it includes 90 watts of power for machines connected through the Thunderbolt 4 port.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will likely announce new versions of its Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad for the Mac at its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">"Scary Fast" event on Monday, October 30</a>, according to a report today from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The updated accessories are expected to be equipped with USB-C ports instead of Lightning ports for charging. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/magic-mouse-2-lightning.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-835832" /><br/>
The accessories will likely be unveiled alongside an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/next-gen-imac-details-rumored-ahead-of-event/">updated 24-inch iMac with an M3 chip</a>, which Gurman also expects to be announced at the event.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear if the accessories will have any design changes beyond the switch to USB-C. They look largely the same as they did when they received their last major update in October 2015, although there have been some minor revisions over the years, including a switch to braided cables, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/new-m1-imac-accessories/">new color options</a> that are only available with the 24-inch iMac. Apple also released a Magic Keyboard with a Touch ID button in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
While the Magic Mouse lasts around a month or longer between charges, the position of the Lightning port on the bottom of the mouse has been a meme in the Apple community for many years, as it prevents the mouse from being used while charging. It's unclear if the USB-C port on the new version will be placed in a more convenient location.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models are equipped with USB-C ports instead of Lightning. The latest Siri Remote for the Apple TV also has a USB-C port, and Apple discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Charger with Lightning ports.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's event on October 30 begins at the unusual time of 5 p.m. Pacific/8 p.m. Eastern, so make sure to mark your calendar correctly.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-mouse/">Magic Mouse</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">New Magic Mouse With USB-C Port Expected at Apple Event Next Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-magic-mouse-with-usb-c-port-expected-at-apple-event-next-week.2408877/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Maps is getting a new Immersive View for routes that uses artificial intelligence, Street View, and aerial images to preview every step of a journey ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/google-maps-immersive-view-routes.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918934" /><br/>
When users get directions for driving, walking, or cycling, Google Maps now offers a "multidimensional experience" that can be used to preview bike lanes, sidewalks, intersections, and parking along the route, <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-october-2023-update/">according to Google</a>. <br/>
<br/>
A time slider can be used to see air quality information and how the route looks as the weather changes throughout the day, while AI and historical driving trends simulate how many cars might be on the road at a given time. <br/>
<br/>
Immersive View for routes is rolling out in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Dublin, Florence, Las Vegas, London, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Paris, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Tokyo and Venice on Android and iOS.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to Immersive View for routes, Search with Live View is being replaced with Lens in Maps, which uses AI and augmented reality to help users orient themselves in a new neighborhood. <br/>
<br/>
Tapping the Lens icon in the search bar and lifting your phone now gives you AR-delivered information about nearby ATMs, transit stations, restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. Google says Lens in Maps is rolling out to more than 50 new cities including Austin, Las Vegas, Rome, São Paulo and Taipei.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, the navigation map is getting updated colors, more realistic buildings, and improved highway lane details. These updates start rolling out in the coming months in 12 countries, including the U.S., Canada, France and Germany. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the U.S. is also set to get information about high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes along a route, and in Europe, AI-powered speed limit information is expanding to 20 countries. Both features start rolling out on Android, iOS, and for cars with Google Built-in in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, Google says EV drivers on Android and iOS will now see even more helpful charging station information, including whether a charger is compatible with their vehicle and whether the available chargers are fast, medium, or slow. This also includes the ability to see when a charger was last used so you know it's not a broken charger. These updates start rolling out globally on iOS and Android this week wherever EV charging station information is available. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/google-maps-immersive-view-for-routes/">Google Maps Gains Immersive View for Routes and Other AI Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-gains-immersive-view-for-routes-and-other-ai-features.2408860/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A new version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro featuring the M3 chip is unlikely to appear at Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">"Scary Fast" Mac event</a> next week, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.</a><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Touch-Bar-13-Inch-MacBook-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1364" height="769" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853221" /><br/>
In the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">"Power On" newsletter</a> shared over the weekend, Gurman said that supplies of the 13-inch MacBook Pro were running low and indicated that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/">could be replaced next week</a>.<br/>
<br/>
He now says that the new machine likely won't appear at Apple's upcoming event. The new entry-level MacBook Pro, codenamed "J504," apparently remains in the works and features a "base version of the M3 chip." Gurman has reported the existence of the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/14/updated-13-inch-macbook-pro-gurman/">since April</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This means that the main models in the running for announcement at the event are the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, all with M3-series chips. Gurman added that he is not expecting to see any other refreshed devices at the event, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-march-2024-launch/">including iPads</a> or AirPods.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/">MacBook Pro 13"</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13">13" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/m3-13-inch-macbook-pro-unlikely-to-be-at-event/">Bloomberg: 13-Inch MacBook Pro With M3 Chip Unlikely to Be Announced at &#039;Scary Fast&#039; Event</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-13-inch-macbook-pro-with-m3-chip-unlikely-to-be-announced-at-scary-fast-event.2408858/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Potential Apple Watch Ban Issued by U.S. Trade Tribunal in Masimo Patent Battle</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on Thursday ordered a ban on Apple Watch imports into the country after finding that Apple violated pulse oximetry company Masimo's patents with the devices (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-issues-potential-apple-watch-import-ban-masimo-patent-fight-2023-10-26/">Reuters</a></em>). <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-6s-202009.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786980" /><br/>
The ban is now subject to presidential review, so it does not take effect immediately, and Apple can take the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit after the 60-day review period ends. Presidents have rarely vetoed bans in the past.<br/>
<blockquote>"Masimo has wrongly attempted to use the ITC to keep a potentially lifesaving product from millions of U.S. consumers while making way for their own watch that copies Apple," an Apple spokesperson said. "While today's decision has no immediate impact on sales of Apple Watch, we believe it should be reversed, and will continue our efforts to appeal."</blockquote>Masimo Chief Executive Officer Joe Kiani said the decision "sends a powerful message that even the world's largest company is not above the law."<br/>
<br/>
Since 2021, Masimo has been embroiled in an ongoing battle with Apple over several health capabilities found in some Apple Watch models, and Masimo has been pushing to have the models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/masimo-apple-watch-series-6-itc-import-ban/">banned</a> in the United States. The ITC decision did not specify which models of Apple Watches would be affected by the ban, but Masimo's original complaint said the Apple Watch Series 6, released in 2020, infringed its patents.<br/>
<br/>
Masimo accuses Apple of having <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/09/apple-masimo-apple-watch-lawsuit/">illegally poached Masimo employees</a> and stole trade secrets when developing the Apple Watch. The company is seeking over &#36;1.8 billion in damages and co-ownership of five Apple pulse oximetry patents that Masimo says use its technology.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ended up <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/apple-watch-masimo-patent-infringement/">invalidating all but two of the patents</a>, but the ITC in January said that Apple had infringed on a Masimo patent relating to light-based technology for reading blood-oxygen levels.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also facing an Apple Watch import ban in a separate patent court battle with medical technology company AliveCor. The ITC issued a ban in February, and the Biden administration <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/22/biden-admin-upholds-apple-watch-patent-ruling/">declined to overrule the decision</a>, but the ban has been placed on hold while proceedings over the validity of AliveCor's patents are completed. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/">Patent Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/">Masimo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/us-trade-tribunal-apple-watch-ban-masimo/">Potential Apple Watch Ban Issued by U.S. Trade Tribunal in Masimo Patent Battle</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/potential-apple-watch-ban-issued-by-u-s-trade-tribunal-in-masimo-patent-battle.2408852/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first beta of an upcoming iOS 17.2 update, and it adds a whole slew of features. You can now access the Journal app that Apple has been working on, and share playlists with friends so they can add songs. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918854" /><br/>
iOS 17.2 is limited to developers right now, but it should soon be coming to public beta testers. We're expecting to see iOS 17.2 released to the public around November or December. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Journal App</h2><br/>
iOS 17.2 includes the Journal app that Apple announced as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. With the Journal app, users can record their daily activities and thoughts, with Apple providing optional prompts that can be used as inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Journal-App-iOS-17-Feature-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2612" height="1469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918878" /><br/>
A Journal entry can be added by tapping on the "+" button in the Journal app, and from there, users can choose a suggestion as the basis for their writing or just opt for "New Entry" to write anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
Entries are automatically tagged with a date for organizational purposes, but there are options for bookmarking, too. Journal entries can include images, voice recordings, and location tags.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Messages App Sticker Tapback Reactions</h2><br/>
You can now long press on any chat bubble in the Messages app to add a sticker response that serves as an alternative to a tapback reaction. Tapping on "Add Sticker" lets you choose either a sticker or an emoji to apply to the corner of an iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-tapback-reply-sticker.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918892" /><br/>
There was already an option to drag a sticker or an emoji onto any message bubble, but this is a much quicker method of quickly responding to an incoming message with a quick graphic that is more expressive than a tapback reaction.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Collaborative Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
There is now an option to create a playlist in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> that multiple people can add to. In a playlist you have made, tap on the three dot icon in top right of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="5484" height="3085" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918890" /><br/>
From there, select the Collaborate option and choose "Start Collaboration." You'll be able to create a link to the playlist, and anyone who has access to that link can add to it. You can also invite people to join via QR code, and if you want, you can approve each person that asks to join.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Favorites Apple Music Playlist</h2><br/>
Songs that you have favorited in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app are now aggregated into a Favorites playlist.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-favorite-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918891" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Music Listening History Focus Filter</h2><br/>
There is a Focus Filter for the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Listening History feature, so if you want to let someone else use your device to listen to music, you can activate this to turn off the Listening History so their song choices won't affect your recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-focus-filters.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918906" /><br/>
<h2>Action Button Translate</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max users can now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-translate-action-button/">choose a new Translate option</a> for the Action Button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-translate.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918874" /><br/>
When the Action Button is set as Translate, pressing to hold causes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to pop up a Translate window that listens for spoken text. It is able to translate from one set language to another, using the languages that you have previously set up in the Translate app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iMessage Contact Key Verification</h2><br/>
First previewed in December 2022, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-imessage-contact-key-verification/">iMessage Contact Key Verification</a> is a feature designed for those who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/Apple-advanced-security-iMessage-Contact-Key-Verification_screen-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876653" /><br/>
Users can ensure that there is no "man in the middle" snooping on iMessage conversations, and there is a Contact Verification Code so that iMessage users can verify that they're speaking to the correct individual during in-person meetings or on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Messages in iCloud Syncing</h2><br/>
The "Messages" section in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> in the Settings app has been renamed to "Messages in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;." It shows the total amount of storage that messages are taking up, the number of messages synced to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, and the time of the last sync. There's also a "Sync Now" option to force an update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-messages-in-icloud.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918896" /><br/>
Apple previously said that additional settings would be synced through Messages in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, like Text Message Forwarding, Send &amp; Receive accounts, and SMS filters across devices, so this may see those additional settings syncing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV App</h2><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">removed the separate tabs</a> for Movies and TV shows in the Store section of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has said that Apple also plans to remove the option to purchase TV shows and movies from the iTunes app as part of a TV app redesign, but that has not yet happened.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-tv-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918905" /><br/>
<h2>Emergency Alerts Local Awareness</h2><br/>
Under Notifications &gt; Emergency Alerts in the Settings app, there is a new "Local Awareness" option that can be turned on. Apple says that Local Awareness uses your approximate location to improve the timeliness, accuracy, and reliability of emergency alerts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-emergency-local-awareness.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918902" /><br/>
<h2>Weather Widgets</h2><br/>
There are new Details, Daily Forecast, and Sunrise/Sunset widgets. Detail shows information like precipitation chance, UV index, wind speed, and air quality, while Daily Forecast offers the weather for the next few days in a small widget size. Sunrise/Sunset shows the sunrise and sunset times for each day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/weather-app-widgets.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918889" /><br/>
<h2>Digital Clock Widget</h2><br/>
There is a new Digital Clock widget that can be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-clock-widget.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918894" /><br/>
<h2>Contact Posters</h2><br/>
You can now select a rainbow-colored text for your name when setting up a Contact Poster in the Contacts app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-contact-poster-rainbow.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918893" /><br/>
<h2>Books Page Turning Animation</h2><br/>
There's a new "Fast Fade" option for the page turning animation in the Books app. Apple has also removed the icon that you could turn on to scroll through content quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-page-turn-animation.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918897" /><br/>
<h2>AirPlay</h2><br/>
There's a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> Receiver" setting that will allow the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset to stream or share content to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-airplay-handoff.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918898" /><br/>
It also looks like the &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; feature for hotels that Apple announced earlier this year is live or will be live soon. It is designed to let you &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; content from your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to an AirPlay-equipped smart TV.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Memoji</h2><br/>
Apple added a "Body" section for Memoji where users can customize waist, bust, shoulders, and arms.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-memoji-body.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918895" /><br/>
<h2>News App</h2><br/>
