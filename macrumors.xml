		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-intelligence-beta-is-here/id1602394741?i=1000664139205">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss Apple's unusual iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 betas that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/">introduce Apple Intelligence</a> for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Ha8HZAVkNU?si=kMFfyntryyFlid0-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The beta versions currently available are exclusive to developers, providing them with a first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/30/apple-intelligence-hands-on/">hands-on look at Apple Intelligence</a>. Apple continues to beta test <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15 separately.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most prominent aspects of Apple Intelligence is its Writing Tools, which allow users to proofread text for spelling and grammar errors and rewrite content to change its tone. Users can also summarize any text, creating paragraphs, lists, or tables, which are accessible anywhere text input is possible across the operating system.<br/>
<br/>
The revamped version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is another key feature of Apple Intelligence. The voice assistant now boasts a new design with a glowing edge around the display when activated, indicating when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is listening. There is also a Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; option, which allows users to interact with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; via text instead of voice commands. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has been enhanced to maintain context between requests and follow along if the user stumbles over words. Additionally, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can now answer a wide range of questions about Apple devices, leveraging Apple's extensive product knowledge and support database.<br/>
<br/>
Several other features included in the beta release are designed to improve communication and media management. For example, users can record, transcribe, and summarize phone calls, which are then stored in the Notes app. The Mail and Messages applications now feature Smart Replies, offering quick, context-based responses. In the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app, the new Memory Maker feature allows users to create memory movies from photo collections using natural language descriptions. This feature automatically selects relevant photos and music, although users can customize their creations further.<br/>
<br/>
Some features have been postponed to later releases. The Image Playground app, which offers image creation tools, is not yet available. Genmoji, a tool for creating custom emojis, and the Image Wand feature, which inserts contextually relevant images into Notes, are also missing from the current beta. Additionally, Priority Notifications, which prioritize important alerts, and advanced Mail categories for sorting incoming messages are not yet implemented. Other postponed features include the ability to remove unwanted objects from photos with a single tap, enhanced &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities such as on-screen awareness, and ChatGPT integration, which should significantly expand &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s conversational abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has indicated that these additional features will be rolled out progressively throughout 2024 and 2025. The current Apple Intelligence beta is limited to U.S. English and is not accessible to developers in the European Union or China. Apple Intelligence is supported by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, all Apple silicon iPads, and all Apple silicon Macs. The public will have access to the first Apple Intelligence features upon the official release of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 later this year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[All four iPhone 17 models expected to launch next year will feature an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, according to Apple analyst Jeff Pu.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature-Single-Camera-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960528" /><br/>
In a research note today for investment bank Haitong, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu shared a chart indicating that the iPhone 17, the tentatively-named <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">iPhone 17 Slim</a>, the iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max will each be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera with six plastic lens elements. By comparison, all iPhone 15 models are equipped with a 12-megapixel front camera with five plastic lens elements.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also claimed that at least one iPhone 17 model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">would be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera</a> with a six-piece lens back in January, so this upgrade has now been rumored by multiple sources, making it more likely. Kuo said these changes will "significantly improve the image quality."<br/>
<br/>
With a higher 24-megapixel resolution, photos can maintain their quality even when cropped to a greater degree, providing more flexibility in post-processing. A six-piece lens would also slightly enhance image quality, as each element is designed to correct for various aberrations and distortions, leading to clearer, more accurate photos.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 17 models are expected to launch in September 2025, so they are still over a year away. Rumors about the two-generations-away iPhones always begin quite early, as Apple develops and prototypes products well before they are released.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/">All iPhone 17 Models Again Rumored to Feature 24MP Front Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphone-17-models-again-rumored-to-feature-24mp-front-camera.2432762/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple&#039;s First Foldable iPad Could Face Delays Into 2026</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's first foldable device may not hit its previously expected 2025 schedule for mass production, based on new comments made by Haitong analyst Jeff Pu.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="820" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-797663" /><br/>
In a note to investors seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said that he continued to expect enhanced Apple product power driven by the likes of the iPhone 17 and Apple Intelligence, but this came despite some "pushouts" seen for Apple's foldable iPad.<br/>
<br/>
When investors or analysts use the term "pushout" in relation to product releases, they typically mean the expected release date has been moved further into the future, either because there's a delay in the development or manufacturing process, or the company has decided to postpone the launch for other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/first-apple-foldable-coming-in-2025/">May report</a>, Pu said Apple's first foldable devices would reach mass production in 2025 and 2026, following increasing evidence of foldable devices in Apple's supply chain. At the time, the analyst said Apple would likely release a large-screen foldable iPad or MacBook in that timeframe before launching a higher-volume foldable iPhone in late 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Pu had said one Apple foldable with a 20.3-inch display would start production in late 2025, which was sooner than previously expected. However, Pu now thinks Apple will join the foldable market in the second quarter of 2026 due to "display durability issues."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/apple-foldable-ipad-delays/">Apple&#039;s First Foldable iPad Could Face Delays Into 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-foldable-ipad-could-face-delays-into-2026.2432754/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is putting pressure on Tencent and ByteDance to make significant changes to two of China's most popular apps in order to remove loopholes that circumvent Apple's typical 30% commission, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-02/apple-pressures-tencent-and-bytedance-over-app-fees-in-china">Bloomberg</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/App-Store-Blue-Banner-Chinese-Flag-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917631" /><br/>
The loopholes are linked to mini-apps that allow users of Tencent's social-messaging app WeChat and ByteDance's short-video app Douyin to play games, hail taxis, and make online purchases without leaving the app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reportedly told both companies they need to prevent mini-app creators from including links to outside payment systems that circumvent its commission system. Apple said it would not approve future updates to WeChat or Douyin until the companies complied. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also has asked Tencent to disable in-game chats between developers and users, because they can also be used to send links, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. Tencent has reportedly pushed back against the idea due to the negative impact it would have on the game experience.<br/>
<br/>
The report characterized the moves by Apple as "unusually aggressive" in China, suggesting they may inflame tensions at a time when its business practices are under scrutiny by antitrust regulators around the world. <br/>
<br/>
An Apple spokesperson who contacted <em>Bloomberg</em> cited its guidelines that the sale of all digital goods must go through its system, and that its review team may reject app submissions that violate that policy.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/apple-pressures-bytedance-tencent-app-fees/">Apple Pressures ByteDance and Tencent Over App Fee Loopholes in China</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pressures-bytedance-and-tencent-over-app-fee-loopholes-in-china.2432751/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Support for Apple Account Cards in the Wallet app has gone live in Canada and Australia, over two years since it first launched in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/apple-account-card-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846914" /><br/>
The change means users can use the Wallet app to add an Apple Account Card, which displays the Apple credit balance associated with an Apple ID. If you receive an App Store or Apple Store gift card, for example, it is added to an Apple Account that was previously visible in the ‌App Store‌ and ‌Apple Store‌ apps. <br/>
<br/>
Support for the feature in Canada and Australia requires iPhone users updating to iOS 17.6, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/nicolas09f9/status/1819173249973997699?s=46">Nicolás Álvarez</a>. Prior to today, support for the feature was thought to be limited to Japan and the US.<br/>
<br/>
To add an Apple Account Card, open up the Wallet app and under "Available Cards," tap on "Add Apple Account." As long as you have an Apple Account balance, you'll be able to add the card.<br/>
<br/>
Once added, you can view your Apple Account balance right from the Wallet app and use it to purchase Apple products, apps, games, and music. It works in the same way as any other card in the Wallet app when at an ‌Apple Store‌.

		<description><![CDATA[The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to feature bigger battery capacities compared to previous-generation models, but it looks like the smaller iPhone 16 Pro device could see the biggest improvement, according to new details.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Update-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953750" /><br/>
Chinese Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Oqjg7Flks">Instant Digital</a> today posted the mAh (milliampere-hours) figures for the iPhone 16 Pro (3,577 mAh) and iPhone 16 Pro Max (4,676 mAh), with only the larger model capacity lining up with previous leaked figures.<br/>
<br/>
The mAh is a measure of battery capacity, or the amount of electric charge that a battery can store. The higher the mAh rating of a battery, the more charge it can hold, and the longer it can power a device. The following table shows the battery capacity comparison between the iPhone 15 Pro models and iPhone 16 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th></th><br/>
 <th>iPhone 15 Pros (2023)</th><br/>
 <th>iPhone 16 Pros (2024)</th><br/>
 <th>% Change</th><br/>
 </tr><br/>
<tr><br/>
 <th>Pro</th><br/>
 <td>3,274 mAh</td><br/>
 <td>3,577 mAh</td><br/>
 <td>+9.25%</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>Max</th><br/>
 <td>4,422 mAh</td><br/>
 <td>4,676 mAh</td><br/>
 <td>+5.74%</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div>The change in capacity of the iPhone 16 Pro over the previous Pro model shows the most marked difference, with an over 9% increase (303 mAh). Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, while not as dramatic as its smaller sibling, gets an over 5% increase (254 mAh). Combined with efficiency improvements, the increases should see both devices offer more sustained real-world usage on a single charge.<br/>
<br/>
According to one <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223409700148&navType=by">rumor</a>, this year's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max will boast a 30-hour-plus battery life (compared to 29 hours for the iPhone 15 Pro Max). Not only that, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/iphone-15-could-feature-stacked-battery-technology/">stacked battery technology</a> for increased energy density and prolonged lifespan. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held an earnings call for the third fiscal quarter of 2024 (second calendar quarter), with Apple reporting its best June quarter to date, with revenue higher than expected. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Apple CFO Luca Maestri provided some insight into Apple's performance, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales, services growth, AI plans, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834994" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1504" /><br/>
We've highlighted the most interesting tidbits from the Q3 2024 earnings call.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Performance</h2><br/>
Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models did better than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models. The install base hit an all-time high during the June quarter.<br/>
<br/>
As for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that the company is "very excited" about Apple Intelligence and the level of value that Apple will provide to users. Cook said that Apple Intelligence presents "another reason for a compelling upgrade."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
On Apple Intelligence, Cook said that Apple can't wait to see what kind of amazing things developers do with Apple Intelligence. Cook expects that developers will adopt Apple Intelligence in their apps on a broad basis, with features that are applicable to many types of apps.<br/>
<br/>
He confirmed that Apple is planning a staggered rollout of the Apple Intelligence features. There are some functions that will come over the course of the year, and languages beyond U.S. English will not be available at launch.<br/>
<br/>
ChatGPT integration with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is expected before the end of the calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is investing more in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with plans to increase that on a yearly basis.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Sales</h2><br/>
Apple saw a sharp increase in &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; sales thanks to the launch of the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> during the quarter. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue was at &#36;7.2 billion, up 24 percent from &#36;5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Services Revenue</h2><br/>
Apple saw a steep increase in services revenue at &#36;24.2 billion, up from &#36;21.2 billion a year ago and a new all-time revenue record. Paid subscriptions hit an all-time high, and Apple has more than one billion paid subscriptions across services. Apple set new records in advertising, cloud, and payment services.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that Apple is seeing continued growth in the level of engagement that customers have with its ecosystem. Maestri also said that Apple is doing a "very good job" improving the quality of its services and improving the amount of content available. Apple plans to continue to add new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> content.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Other Product Revenue</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> revenue dropped one percent (&#36;39.3B), Mac revenue was up two percent (&#36;7B), and Home, Accessories, and Wearables fell two percent (&#36;8.1B).<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Digital Markets Act</h2><br/>
Maestri said that Apple is continuing to discuss its DMA compliance with the European Commission. Apple has seen "a good level of adoption" from developers on the changes, and in general, results for the services business and for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> have been "pretty good until now."<br/>
<br/>
Maestri once again reiterated that the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; is responsible for seven percent of the total revenue that Apple earns in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple is working to understand the regulatory requirements it is subject to before introducing Apple Intelligence in the European Union. Apple Intelligence features will not be available in the EU when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> launch.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>September Quarter</h2><br/>
Apple said that it expects September quarter revenue to grow year over year at a rate similar to the June quarter. Services revenue is expected to grow double digits, similar to the rest of this year. Gross margin is expected to be 45.5 and 46.6 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Mac will have a challenging compare from a year ago, according to Maestri, as there was the full quarter impact of the 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> in fall 2023. There have been rumors that we could see refreshed M4 MacBook Pros before the end of the year, but if Apple is expecting Mac revenue to fall, that may not happen.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/apple-q3-2024-earnings-takeaways/">Apple&#039;s Q3 2024 Earnings Call Takeaways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-q3-2024-earnings-call-takeaways.2432715/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/">announced</a> financial results for its third fiscal quarter of 2024, which corresponds to the second calendar quarter of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/aapl-3q24-line.jpg" alt="" width="1720" height="792" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960550" /><br/>
For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of &#36;85.8 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;21.4 billion, or &#36;1.40 per diluted share, compared to revenue of &#36;81.8 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;19.9 billion, or &#36;1.26 per diluted share, in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/03/apple-3q-2023-results/">year-ago quarter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple set new June quarter records for both revenue and earnings per share, while the Services category set an all-time revenue record. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> category also saw a notable increase in revenue thanks to the introduction of new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
Gross margin for the quarter was 46.3 percent, compared to 44.5 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of &#36;0.25 per share, payable on August 15 to shareholders of record as of August 12.<blockquote>"Today Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of &#36;85.8 billion, up 5 percent from a year ago," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "During the quarter, we were excited to announce incredible updates to our software platforms at our Worldwide Developers Conference, including Apple Intelligence, a breakthrough personal intelligence system that puts powerful, private generative AI models at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We very much look forward to sharing these tools with our users, and we continue to invest significantly in the innovations that will enrich our customers' lives, while leading with the values that drive our work."</blockquote>As has been the case for over four years now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current quarter ending in September.<br/>

<br/>
<b>2:23 pm</b>: The Q&A session is beginning.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:25 pm</b>: Q: Can you help us understand where you see &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are and what that translates to, and potential pent up demand as we enter a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cycle?<br/>
<br/>
A: The install base hit an all time high during the quarter, and so we were very happy about that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in general, it grew in constant currency. And the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of of where we currently are.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid cycle to call upgrade rates. With Apple intelligence, we're very excited and about the level of value that we're going to provide to users and we believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:28 pm</b>: Q: Can you dig into China dynamics a bit, sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in content currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare. You know that came on the back of some &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; discounting. So can you share color on the China market as a whole? How much do you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market, as we look forward?<br/>
<br/>
A: This quarter was an improvement from the first half of the year. If you look at &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, in particular, for Greater China, the install base set a record. We also, in mainland China, set a June quarter record for upgraders. And so, that that's a very strong signal. iPhones were the top three models in Urban China.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to the September of '23 if you if you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying the our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in mainland China, the majority of customers are buying for the first time. We're very confident in the long term.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:29 pm</b>: Q: Now that you've launched Apple Intelligence, will it accelerate Services and augment it, maybe folks need to buy more storage, how is it a catalyst for Services in the next year?<br/>
<br/>
A: We started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week. Some of the features are out there as of Monday. We couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. This will enable developers to take their apps to the next level, we're taking this first step in getting the beta out there and we're excited to see what they do with it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:32 pm</b>: Q: Have you seen a shift in demand for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and Pro Max models that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence-enabled phones?<br/>
<br/>
A: We just announced the requirements for the system and the Silicon level in June, and we had limited time in the quarter so it's really too early to tell.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: With the focus on upgrader potential for the next few years, what are you expecting for the US promotional environment from your channel partners given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle?<br/>
<br/>
A: We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings and it's another compelling reason for an upgrade. I think the promotional questions are for the carriers themselves to answer, but I think it will be a key time for a compelling upgrade cycle.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:35 pm</b>: Q: Is the intent to launch Apple Intelligence at the same time to consumers or will it get staggered? How could it affect how consumers buy during the rollout?<br/>
<br/>
A: We started with some features this week, but not the complete suite. There are some languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year, and other features. ChatGPT will be integrated by the end of the calendar year. It is a staggered launch.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:37 pm</b>: Q: Services growth rate has been extremely impressive for several quarters. How much is coming from installed base growth versus better monetization of the existing base? How do you see that going forward?<br/>
<br/>
A: Combination of a number of factors, install base growth is very important, because we have more customers. We are seeing this consistently for many quarters, we see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem, we have more transacting accounts every quarter, more people using the ecosystem, both free and paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits for many quarters now. Our paid subscriptions on our platform are growing strong double digits as well. Obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARPU standpoint and a volume standpoint. <br/>
<br/>
As you've seen over the last several years, we launch new services and we've launched many new services fairly recently. Payments, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, Fitness+, we're providing more opportunities for customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we've done a good job improving the quality of these services. Launching new shows and new games all the time and I think you will continue to see that going forward. Very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at performance of Services a year ago, it got a little more challenging in the second half of the fiscal year, but in spite of that we delivered a level of growth better than we were expecting.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:39 pm</b>: Q: You announced Apple Intelligence but also announced partnerships with OpenAI and other partners down the road. How should we think about monetization of models like these and these partnerships? The CapEx investments are being made by these potential partners, but you're leveraging  your distribution. Do you see the Services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor or these partnerships over time?<br/>
<br/>
A: The way I look at it, Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and private cloud compute. A lot of that will be things with a personal context, and then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially and that will be focused on world knowledge. The monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they're confidential, but I see both aspects as being very important. People want both.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:42 pm</b>: Q: You had margin growth over the last several years and a bit more flat. Are there other headwinds besides FX that are limiting upside perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
A: Foreign exchange is incremental on a year over year basis and is outside our control, we try to hedge but it is what it is. When the dollar is strong our margins are affected. Within the products business, our products have different margin profiles and depending on their relative success in the marketplace, our product gross margin tends to move. The mix of our products has an impact on gross margin. We just launched an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; so that's one of the factors. We want all our products to be successful, so we always look at gross margin dollars as first priority and percentage follows from that.<br/>
<br/>
Also we have the state of the commodity markets and this tends to go in cycles, so we'll see how that plays out over time. We feel good about the level of gross margin we have for our products business. We feel in a good position there.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:44 pm</b>: Q: We keep hearing about this increase in silicon content for AI edge devices, Luca you talk about increasing commodity costs, how should we think about margins for new AI devices, and do any Apple Intelligence features need more hardware than we have today?<br/>
<br/>
A: In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements, so from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; point of view, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M-series of silicon that started in 2020, and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is the same. The M series of silicon. There are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.<br/>
<br/>
From a gross margin standpoint, we don't provide any color for the quarter, 45.5-46.5, essentially broadly in line with what we recorded for the June quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:45 pm</b>: Q: On China, was the weakness macro related or related to Apple or domestic competitors?<br/>
<br/>
A: The competitive environment is the most competitive in the world and that remains the case. The macro economic factors have been in the press too, I'm not an expert on those, I can only tell you what we're seeing. We were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:47 pm</b>: Q: Developers are just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence, are these going to be iterative applications, is there some category that lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence, games, more creative, trying to get a sense...<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence, we've thought about it as all of the apps you use every day. Notes, Mail, Messages and all the rest. There's been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. That's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user and in a way that will get them very excited about it.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. I think it's profound, and we'll see what the developers do. We're excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:49 pm</b>: Q: It sounds like, with Services being strong and FX easing, you're saying product revenue might be flat with the quarter next year. What are the puts and takes in that outlook with Apple Intelligence stoking demand going forward?<br/>
<br/>
A: We have provided... we think we'll be growing company revenue at a state that is similar to what we reported. 5%, in spite of the fact that we'll have 150 bp of FX headwinds in the December quarter. We said that we'll grow Services double digits at a rate similar to the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories, there's a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you. Keep in mind, on Mac we'll have a challenging compare from a year ago given that we had a full-quarter impact of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; 15-inch a year ago, and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; we had the benefit from the launch of the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; this past quarter so keep that in mind on a sequential basis.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:50 pm</b>: Q: You mentioned a staggered launch of Apple Intelligence, are all of these going to be a part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> or will some potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?<br/>
<br/>
A: We'll start with US English this fall and add more functionality, features, and languages and regions coverage over the next year. We gave a time frame and we're tracking to that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:52 pm</b>: Q: Are you seeing any impact from changes made to the European app store rules?<br/>
<br/>
A: We have seen a good level of adoption from developers on those changes, we are in ongoing discussions with the European Commission on how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. In general, our results for the Services business and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> have been pretty good. To provide a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue we get from the EU on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; is about 7% of the total.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:53 pm</b>: Q: Re Apple Intelligence, how do you think about the regulatory process in the EU and China, thinking about the rollout, are you embedding the regulartory aspect in it and how should we think about timing?<br/>
<br/>
A: We are engaging with the regulatory bodies and we're moving as fast as we can. Our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that but we're engaged with both.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:54 pm</b>: Q: On Wearables, it's been lagging there for the last couple of quarters. Any comment on that?<br/>
<br/>
A: When you look at Wearables, Home and Accessories, we have a difficult launch compare. Last year we had the continued benefit of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. It's important to keep that in mind. If you take a step back and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, the Wearables business has grown to almost &#36;40 billion, double what it was five years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:56 pm</b>: Q: You referenced the investment in innovation, R&D to sales ratio reached a record even before launching Apple Intelligence. How should we think about CapEx for cloud compute capacity and is it possible to forecast services usage as these things roll out?<br/>
<br/>
A: We've increased R&D over time, we've been investing in AI and ML for years. We've redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML, and the growth is sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared. On CapEx, remember that we employ a hybrid approach where we do things internally and we have partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. Yes, you can expect that we will continue to invest and increase it year on year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:58 pm</b>: Q: When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they're up materially. What, in the services mix or cost controls, what is driving structural higher free cash flow margins across the business?<br/>
<br/>
A: I'm glad you noticed that. We're pretty pleased with that fact. We also increased our return to shareholders, a record quarter for us. An improvement in the topline helps, margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and quarters has helped. That is driving better operating cash flow. On the CapEx front, as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some investments show up on our balance sheet, other investments show up somewhere else and we pay as we go. In general, we try to run the company efficiently. We think capital efficiency is a good thing. We're pleased that our free cash flow is doing well this year.<br/>
<br/>

		<title>Apple Updates App Store Guidelines for PC Emulator Apps</title>

		<category>App Store Review Guidelines</category>
		<category>Apple Developer Program</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today refreshed its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Guidelines</a> created for developers, modifying the emulator rules to include express permission for PC emulators to download games.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
Guideline 4.7 has been updated to state that PC emulator apps can offer to download games. The guideline previously said that console emulator apps could include the option to download games, but it did not explicitly cover PC emulators.<br/>
<br/>
The rule change comes following Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> approval of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-approves-first-retro-pc-emulator-ios/">PC emulator UTM SE</a>, which lets users emulate old versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux to use classic software and games.<br/>
<br/>
Apple initially rejected UTM SE in June, even though it started <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">allowing retro game emulators</a> back in April. Apple told the app's developers at the time that it violated the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; guidelines because a "PC is not a console." The developers behind UTM SE were able to make some technical changes, and Apple ultimately approved the app.<br/>
<br/>
UTM SE was the first PC emulator app to be allowed on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, but the guideline changes today will streamline the approval process for similar apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also updated its separate guidelines for app notarization, which applies to third-party apps that are submitted for distribution outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in the European Union. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; guidelines 4.7, 4.7.2, and 4.7.3 are now applicable to the notarization process.<br/>
<br/>
The 4.7 guideline allows for mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins, and game emulators. 4.7.2 prevents apps from extending or exposing native platform APIs to the software without Apple's permission, and 4.7.3 says that apps may not share data or privacy permissions to any individual software offered within an app without user consent. Prior to today's update, these guidelines were not part of the EU notarization review process.<br/>
<br/>
Apps distributed outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; are not subject to all of Apple's rules, but to receive notarization from Apple, third-party apps do have to adhere to some guidelines. Apple created the notarization process for EU apps distributed outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and an app must have Apple approval to run on an Apple device.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-review-guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/app-store-review-guidelines-pc-emulator-apps/">Apple Updates App Store Guidelines for PC Emulator Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-updates-app-store-guidelines-for-pc-emulator-apps.2432705/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<category>Apple vs. DoJ</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today filed a motion to dismiss its ongoing lawsuit with the United States Department of Justice, a standard step in the litigation process. In its motion to dismiss, Apple argues that the government's complaint has not demonstrated anticompetitive conduct, anticompetitive effect that harms consumers, or that Apple is a monopoly power in the U.S. smartphone market. The government needs to prove all three of these claims for a successful antitrust lawsuit.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-vs-DOJ-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943221" /><br/>
For the anticompetitive allegation, the DoJ lawsuit focused on third-party access to Apple services and features, but Apple argues that there is longstanding Supreme Court precedent that companies can set the terms and conditions of their third-party dealings. Apple claims that the DoJ is attempting to force it to spend money to develop tools for big business competitors, which could have a "chilling" effect on innovation. The DoJ suggested, for example, that Apple should have developed an iMessage app for Android.<br/>
<blockquote>iMessage is Apple's proprietary, innovative messaging service that Apple created to competitively differentiate iPhone. Under the Government's view, companies like Apple should face antitrust liability for not expending the resources, cost, and time to develop versions of proprietary products and services for competitors' devices.</blockquote><br/>
Apple points out that the DoJ's complaint does not explain how Apple's alleged limiting of "super apps," cloud streaming apps, digital wallets, messaging apps, and competing smartwatches has harmed consumers or impacted consumer choice about which smartphone to purchase. For a successful antitrust lawsuit, the DoJ needs to prove that Apple's actions hurt consumers and stifle competition, and the DoJ argues that Apple has "locked" customers into its ecosystem.<br/>
<blockquote>It is implausible to claim, as the Government does, that Apple has deterred any customers from switching to Google or Samsung because of its policies with respect to "super apps," cloud gaming, smartwatches, or anything else. The opposite is much more plausible: Users unhappy with Apple's reasonable policies on third-party access can and do switch away to competitors' devices, where those limits do not exist.</blockquote><br/>
Apple argues that it is not a monopolist because it faces competition from companies like Google and Samsung, preventing the government from establishing the "typical hallmarks of monopoly power." Apple does not have enough U.S. smartphone marketshare to make the monopoly claim easy for the government to establish. The DoJ has compared Apple to Microsoft, but Microsoft had a 95 percent share of the operating system market when it faced an antitrust lawsuit, while Apple's is closer to 65 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Apple further suggests that the DoJ is aiming to have the court establish a "new theory of antitrust liability" that no prior court has recognized and that would provide "unprecedented authority to control Apple design choices." Apple says that the DoJ is targeting the very features that distinguish iPhones from competing devices, and if the DoJ ultimately wins the case, courts would need to "oversee product-design and policy choices," which they are not equipped to do.<br/>
<br/>
A motion to dismiss limits the information that Apple can provide to dispute the DoJ's claims, and rulings often favor plaintiffs. The allegations that the DoJ made are assumed to be true at this stage, and Apple needs to prove that the claims fail as a matter of law. For this reason, the lawsuit is likely to progress, though claims could be narrowed and there is a chance for dismissal.<br/>
<br/>
If the court rules in the Department of Justice's favor on the dismissal, there will be many future chances for Apple to sway the court because this is a legal battle that will span years.<br/>
<br/>
After Apple's motion to dismiss, the government has until September 12 to file an opposition brief. From there, Apple will file a reply brief on October 10, and there could be a possible hearing after that. A ruling on the motion to dismiss is expected in late 2024 or early 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Should the government win, Apple will file an answer to the initial complaint, leading to a discovery period where both parties provide documents, expert testimony, and depositions, which can last for over a year. A summary judgment will follow, which is where Apple can make a stronger case, and that might not happen until 2027. Should the case ultimately go to trial, a trial could take place sometime in 2028, or even later.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today announced three new AI features that are coming to its Chrome browser, with Google taking advantage of the latest Google AI and Gemini models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" /><br/>
Google Lens is now available for the Chrome desktop browser, allowing users to search for what they see on the browser screen with a quick drag and search gesture. Google says that Chrome users can select anything on the page to search for visual matches, including text and images.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Introducing the new Google Lens in Chrome desktop" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43YUCNEHBHU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Searches can be refined by color, brand, and other details, and follow up questions are available for a deeper dive into a topic.<br/>
<br/>
Tab compare is a new feature that is designed to let users see an AI-generated overview of products from across multiple tabs in one spot. Google says that this is useful for comparing reviews, prices, and other elements of multiple products when deciding what to purchase.<br/>
<br/>
Google is also introducing a natural language search option for Chrome browsing history, allowing Chrome users to quickly find a site that they visited in the past with a phrase like "What was that ice cream shop I looked at last week?" Conversational search is optional, and can be turned on or off in the Chrome settings. It will not include data from incognito mode.<br/>
<br/>
The AI-powered Google Lens feature will be available with the latest Chrome update that's rolling out over the next few days, while the other two features will be available in the next few weeks. Tab compare and the browser search option will both be rolled out in the U.S. to begin with.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/">Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/google-lens-ai-chrome-desktop/">Google Adds AI-Powered Google Lens and Tab Compare to Chrome for Desktop</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-adds-ai-powered-google-lens-and-tab-compare-to-chrome-for-desktop.2432693/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is introducing a set of AI features in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 under the banner "Apple Intelligence." These features are officially only currently available in beta to developers in the US, but it's actually pretty easy to get it up and running on iPhones and iPads in most other locations with the exception of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-europe-delay/">European Union</a> and China.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
The main reason Apple has limited region access to Apple Intelligence is that it only supports US English at this time, but if you can work with that – and you have a compatible device – then there's no technical reason why you can't start exploring the new AI features. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Supported Devices</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence encompasses a range of capabilities, including composing text and emails, automating actions across various apps, generating images, summarizing documents and texts, and more. However, these features require a lot of on-device computing power, so before you do anything, it's worth checking if your device is compatible. iPhone users need either an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max to run Apple Intelligence, while only iPads powered by M1 or later Apple silicon processors are compatible. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Install Beta Software</h2><br/>
If your device is supported, the first thing you need to do is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-18-developer-beta-iphone/">install the developer beta for your device</a>. Once you've followed the instructions provided in the linked article and your device is up and running with the latest beta, follow these steps on your iPhone or iPad.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>, then tap through to <strong>General ➝ Language & Region</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Add Language..</strong> and choose <strong>English (US)</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Region</strong> and choose <strong>United States</strong>. (Note that this won't affect your App Store regions or purchases.)<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/settings-region.jpg" alt="settings" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960491" /><br/>
  <li>Return to the main <strong>Settings</strong> menu and tap <strong>Apple Intelligence & Siri</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Language</strong> and choose <strong>English (United States)</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>You will now be able to join the Apple Intelligence waitlist, which in most cases gets accepted in just a few minutes. Under the Apple Intelligence header text, tap <strong>Join Waitlist</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-intelligence-join-waitlist.jpg" alt="" width="1391" height="807" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960498" /><br/>
<li>After what should hopefully be a short wait, the message will change to <strong>Turn On Apple Intelligence</strong>. Tap it, and a welcome message should appear, indicating you have sucessfully enabled the AI features on your device. </li></ol><br/>
<br/>

		<title>Apple Arcade Frustrations Persist for Game Developers</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Some developers continue to be unhappy working with Apple's subscription-based mobile gaming service <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-again-late-payments-stonewalled-studios-terrible-tech-support-and-vision-pro-woes/"><em>mobilegamer.biz</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/apple-arcade-orange-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-748620" /><br/>
Talking to the website, some developers said that studios have to wait up to six months to receive payments from &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;. They also pointed out difficulties getting responses to routine emails, unsatisfactory technical support, and poor discoverability. One developer said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>We were able to sign a good deal for our titles which covered our whole development budget. Things have changed since the early times, it's a very difficult and long process to sign a deal with Apple these days. The lack of vision and clear focus of the platform is frustrating and if there is any goal, it keeps changing every year or so. Also technical support is pretty miserable.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Most developers pointed out that &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; pays well, particularly during its first few years:<blockquote>Whatever anyone else says, the advances were fantastic. They were off the charts compared to what we're used to being paid. And you got royalties on top of that.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
While initially developers benefited from prompt monthly payments from the Bonus Pool of ongoing royalty payments, there is now a five month backlog. One developer claims to have almost gone out of business as a result of the slow payments, while others have had to chase for payments for months.<br/>
<br/>
Developers also pointed out general communication issues, and when they do receive a response, the results are often disappointing. One developer shared:<blockquote>We can go weeks without hearing from Apple at all and their general response time to emails is three weeks, if they reply at all. We're supposed to be able to ask product, technical and commercial questions, but often half the Apple team won't turn up and when they do they have no idea what's going on and can't answer our questions, either because they don't have any knowledge on how to answer it, or are not able to share that info for confidentiality reasons.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
There are also apparently significant issues with developing &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; games for the Vision Pro headset. Developers expressed their frustration with Apple's technical support for the  Vision Pro, which they described as inadequate and unhelpful. One developer said:<blockquote>The technical support is awful – the worst I have seen anywhere. They are unable to offer any insights into how the hardware and the software it runs on works, or how essential middleware is meant to work with it.<br/>
<br/>
Developing for Vision Pro is like going back in time 10 years because despite the advertised power – and the cost – it is not a machine built for gaming. Getting any complex games working on the platform is difficult.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Other sources told mobilegamer.biz that while they had been approached by Apple to make a game for the Vision Pro, they were offered no financial incentives and no guarantees of promotion. This contrasts with competitors like Meta, which offers generous financial incentives and marketing guarantees to developers creating content for its platforms.<br/>
<br/>
Developers also pointed out issues with quality assurance and updates, claiming that a prolonged discussion with Apple over a single update cost their team two months of work. "Submitting updates is so painful our developers started trying to avoid it," they said. Likewise, there are apparently issues with discoverability. Other developers shared their frustration, stating:<blockquote>It feels like the game's been in a morgue for the last two years. It doesn't matter what we put in the game, Apple won't feature us, it's like we don't exist. So as a developer you think, well, they've given us this money for exclusivity… I don't want to give them the money back, but I do want people to play my game. It's like we're invisible.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
One developer concluded with a broader critique of &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;'s strategic direction:<blockquote>Arcade has no clear strategy and feels like a bolt-on to the Apple company ecosystem rather than like it is truly supported inside the company. Apple 100% does not understand gamers – they have little to no info on who plays their games that they can share with developers, or how they interact with games on the platform already.<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
I believe Apple Arcade is a good idea in general, but they need a clear goal for where it should go and what it is for. That's a question they need to answer and then act accordingly.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Another developer offered a slightly more positive perspective:<blockquote>I think Arcade knows who its audience is much more today than at the outset. If that doesn't turn out to be high concept artful indie games, that's not Apple's fault. If they can build a business on family games, good for them and good for the devs who can chase that opportunity.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; launched in September 2019, giving users access to a large library of games for a monthly fee of &#36;6.99. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; is also available as part of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> subscription bundle, which combines multiple Apple services into a single monthly plan. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/apple-arcade-frustrations-persist-for-developers/">Apple Arcade Frustrations Persist for Game Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-arcade-frustrations-persist-for-game-developers.2432682/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Google Maps and Waze Updated With New iPhone and CarPlay Features</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/maps-waze-new-features-information-on-the-go/">announced</a> new Waze and Google Maps features rolling out for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> users that aim to keep them safer and more informed on the go. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/google-maps-waze-updates.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960484" /><br/>
First up, changes to Maps aim to make it easier to report incidents and helpful information, like nearby construction, lane closures, objects and police presence. These reports come from the Maps and Waze communities, and users will now see which app a report came from. There are larger reporting icons that are designed to be easier to tap for quickly sharing updates, and other drivers can also confirm the incident with a quick tap.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Google Maps gains new destination guidance to make it less confusing when users don't know where to enter or park when they arrive somewhere, especially if it's nighttime. When driving to a place, Maps' new destination guidance will automatically light up your building and its entrance as you approach it, in addition to showing you nearby parking lots. <br/>
<br/>
Over on Waze, Google is adding the ability to see new camera types that enforce things like speed limits and carpool lanes. For example, drivers now see an alert if they're approaching a camera that snaps pictures for things like speeding, running a red light, using the wrong lane (like bus, HOV or carpool), not wearing a seatbelt, or using phones while driving.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Waze is getting a new traffic events feature, which is meant to give users a better understanding of how things like parades, concerts, and sporting events are impacting nearby traffic. If a driver recently went through an impacted area or has places saved near the area in Waze, they will now get a notification once the event has started. This will include details like the cause of the event, if there are road closures and real-time traffic conditions. To help your friends and family, these details are also easily shareable, allowing others to be more prepared for their own ride. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, Waze drivers will soon get navigation guidance like turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic updates while their phone is locked. Google says Lock Screen navigation for Waze is coming to iOS this fall, while the other updates to Google Maps and Waze are rolling out globally now on Android and iOS, cars with Google built-in, Android Auto, and Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/waze/">Waze</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/google-maps-waze-new-carplay-features/">Google Maps and Waze Updated With New iPhone and CarPlay Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-and-waze-updated-with-new-iphone-and-carplay-features.2432673/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Leaker <a href="https://x.com/sonnydickson/status/1818820084762292243">Sonny Dickson</a> is back today with a new dummy unit image showing three alleged iPhone 16 Pro color variants, including a seemingly darker Black Titanium unit compared to the color of the same name on existing iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iphone-16-pro-colors-sonny.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960477" /><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to come in black, white or silver, gray or "Natural Titanium," and a rose or rose gold color replacing Blue Titanium, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/iphone-16-lineup-to-come-in-these-two-new-colors/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1772522408144191732">other leakers</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Dickson's image shows the white, black, and gray versions, but there is no sign of the much-rumored rose gold variant, which was recently described by one leaker as having more of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/new-iphone-16-pro-color-bronze-appearance/">bronze-like hue</a>. Apple did not include a gold option in the iPhone 15 lineup, so a similar variant could see heightened demand.<br/>
<br/>
One <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/">rumor</a> suggests that Apple is using an improved process for finishing and coloring titanium, which will result in a glossier look than the brushed aluminum finish of the iPhone 15 Pro models. The glossy finish could look much more like the stainless steel that Apple used in prior years, but it will be more resistant to scratches.<br/>
<br/>
We don't actually know the official color names yet, but Apple may choose to stick with the Titanium colorway branding it used for the iPhone 15 Pro models. The next-generation iPhone 16 lineup is due to arrive around mid-September, so we will know for sure soon.

		<description><![CDATA[Logitech has worked on a "forever mouse" that could come with a subscription fee for regular software updates, according to Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/logitech-mouse.jpg" alt="" width="1187" height="668" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960435" /><br/>
There are no plans to release such a product at the current time, but Faber explained the concept during a recent appearance on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206847/logitech-ceo-hanneke-faber-mouse-keyboard-gaming-decoder-podcast-interview"><em>The Verge</em>'s Decoder podcast</a> with Nilay Patel. Apparently, the Logitech innovation center team in Ireland showed Faber a "forever mouse" that is designed to be used for many years. It's a "little heavier" than a standard mouse, and it has "great software and services" that get constantly updated.<blockquote>The other day, in Ireland, in our innovation center there, one of our team members showed me a forever mouse with the comparison to a watch. This is a nice watch, not a super expensive watch, but I'm not planning to throw that watch away ever. So why would I be throwing my mouse or my keyboard away if it's a fantastic-quality, well-designed, software-enabled mouse. The forever mouse is one of the things that we'd like to get to.</blockquote>Logitech is aiming to increase the longevity of its products through more premium devices that can be updated over time. Of course, as a mouse is a one-time purchase, continual software updates would need to be funded through some kind of service model.<br/>
<br/>
Patel asked Faber if she could "envision a subscription mouse," and she responded "possibly." Faber went on to explain that customers would "never have to worry about [their mice] again," which is similar to Logitech's video conferencing services.<br/>
<br/>
When asked whether Logitech had some other model for monetization than subscription fees or advertising, Faber said no, and that she was "intrigued" by a forever mouse that has an accompanying business model around software updates.<blockquote>We're continuing to recycle and refurbish products. All of that is good. But that said, I am intrigued by a forever mouse or forever video conferencing solution that you just update with software and create a business model around that.</blockquote><br/>
Later in the interview, Faber said that there could also be a model where customers trade in a mouse for a newer version, similar to something like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Upgrade Program.<blockquote>The forever mouse, and the forever mouse could be the mouse that you keep and we just send you software updates, but it could also be the mouse that you turn in at Best Buy and we get it back or Best Buy takes it back and refurbs and resells it, which is another business model. We're starting to do that but not yet at the scale that we need to.</blockquote><br/>
Faber pointed out that customers spend around &#36;26 on a mouse or keyboard on average, which is "really so low" for "stuff you use every day." She said there's "so much room to create more value in that space as we make people more productive."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/logitech/">Logitech</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/logitech-forever-mouse/">Logitech Considers &#039;Forever Mouse&#039; With Subscription Fee</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/logitech-considers-forever-mouse-with-subscription-fee.2432653/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/steve-jobs-auction.jpg" alt="" width="1270" height="715" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960438" /><br/>
A <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/348973406984025-apple-1-computer-from-apple-employee-dana-redington-from-the-trade-in-pile-in-steve-jobs-office-gifted-by-jobs-and-woz-to-apples-first-applications-engineer/">functional Apple-1 Computer</a> is being auctioned off, and this one is sourced from former Apple employee Dana Redington. It initially came from a "trade-in" pile that was in Steve Jobs' office, and it was gifted to Redington by Jobs and Wozniak. Apple-1 expert Corey Cohen restored the machine. Bids are close to &#36;100,000 now, with the Apple-1 expected to sell for over &#36;300,000.<br/>
<br/>

Several original Polaroids that Jobs used when presenting the Apple-1 to Paul Terrell <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/348985606984001-steve-jobs-3-apple-1-prototype-polaroid-photographs-given-to-paul-terrell-of-the-byte-shop-in-1976/?cat=668">are being sold off</a>. Terrell famously ordered the Apple-1 machines to sell in The Byte Shop, and the Polaroids were part of the pitch deck. The images are expected to sell for over &#36;30,000.<br/>

An original 4GB &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is also for sale, with the device in original condition and still in the box. Original iPhones have been selling for upwards of &#36;50,000, and the rare 4GB models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/rare-original-iphone-record-auction-price/">have sold for</a> over &#36;190,000. RR Auction expects the latest 4GB &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to sell for &#36;80,000+.<br/>

		<title>Sonos Fixes Bug Causing Battery Drain on iPhone and iPad</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Sonos today rolled out a fix for a bug with the Sonos app that has been causing it to drain a significant amount of battery on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. If you've been having battery life issues and are a Sonos user, you may want to install the update ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/sonos-redesigned-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947528" /><br/>
Sonos community manager Keith Nieves <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1egnm5m/sonos_app_update_available/">confirmed the bug fix on Reddit</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210410/sonos-iphone-battery-drain-fix-now-available">The Verge</a></em>), stating that the latest version of the app addresses an unspecified issue that was causing excessive battery use on some Apple devices. There have been several complaints about the app's battery usage over the course of the last week, with the Sonos app running constantly in the background.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, several Reddit users have since said they're having issues with the update, which seems to be causing a "No System Found" error message. This is a bug that existed previously, but the update seems to have increased the frequency of the error. Other users have had to re-add their speakers to the Sonos app.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos has committed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/sonos-app-update-apology/">providing bi-weekly updates</a> for its iOS app in an effort to fix an ill-received design overhaul. Back in May, Sonos introduced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/redesigned-sonos-app/">redesigned iPhone and iPad app</a> that was meant to provide a more personalized and customizable experience, but it brought several bugs and also removed key features that Sonos customers rely on.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos users have been unhappy with the app, and last week, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence penned an apology and outlined the updates that Sonos will introduce over the next few months. Music Library configuration is set to return in August, while user interface improvements and system stability will be addressed in September.<br/>
<br/>
Alarm consistency will improve in September as well, and in October, Sonos will reintroduce edit mode for playlists and queues.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/sonos-fixes-battery-drain-bug/">Sonos Fixes Bug Causing Battery Drain on iPhone and iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-fixes-bug-causing-battery-drain-on-iphone-and-ipad.2432641/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser that was <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to allow users to test features that are planned for future release versions of the Safari browser.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Safari-Technology-Preview-Updated-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960117" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 200 includes fixes and updates for CSS, JavaScript, Rendering, and Web Extensions.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> beta. Set to launch this fall, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; is the newest version of macOS that Apple is working on. The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; browser numbering is sequential, so Apple has released 200 updates to its test browser in the last eight years.  <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a> from Apple's website. Complete release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while it is designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download and use. <br/>
