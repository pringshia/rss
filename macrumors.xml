		<description><![CDATA[Leading artificial intelligence companies including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are facing "diminishing returns" from their costly efforts to build newer AI models, according to a new <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/openai-google-and-anthropic-are-struggling-to-build-more-advanced-ai">Bloomberg</a></em> report. The stumbling blocks appear to be growing in size as Apple continues a phased rollout of its own AI features through Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/chatgpt-for-iphone-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896306" /><br/>
OpenAI's latest model, known internally as Orion, has reportedly fallen short of the company's performance expectations, particularly in handling coding tasks. The model is said to be lacking the significant improvements over existing systems when compared to the gains GPT-4 made versus its predecessor.<br/>
<br/>
Google is also reportedly facing similar obstacles with its upcoming Gemini software, while Anthropic has delayed the release of its anticipated Claude 3.5 Opus model. Industry experts who spoke to <em>Bloomberg</em> attributed the challenges to the increasing difficulty in finding "new, untapped sources of high-quality, human-made training data" and the enormous costs associated with developing and operating new models concurrently with existing ones.<br/>
<br/>
Silicon Valley's belief that more computing power, data, and larger models will inevitably lead to better performance, and ultimately the holy grail – artificial general intelligence (AGI) – could be based on false assumptions, suggests the report. Consequently, companies are now exploring alternative approaches, including further post-training (incorporating human feedback to improve responses and refining the tone) and developing AI tools called agents that can perform targeted tasks, such as booking flights or sending emails on a user's behalf.<br/>
<br/>
"The AGI bubble is bursting a little bit," said Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at AI startup Hugging Face. She told <em>Bloomberg</em> that "different training approaches" may be needed to make AI models work really well on a variety of tasks. Other experts who spoke to the outlet echoed Mitchell's sentiment.<br/>
<br/>
How much impact these challenges will have on Apple's approach is unclear, though Apple Intelligence is more focused in comparison, and the company uses internal large language models (LLMs) grounded in privacy. Apple's AI services mainly operate on-device, while the company's Private Cloud Compute encrypted servers are only pinged for tasks requiring more advanced processing power. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is integrating AI capabilities into existing products and services, including writing tools, Siri improvements, and image generation features, so it can't be said to be competing directly in the LLM space. However, Apple has agreed a partnership with OpenAI that allows Siri to optionally hand off more open-ended queries to ChatGPT. Apple has also reportedly held discussions with other LLM companies about similar outsourcing partnerships.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible that the challenges faced by major AI companies pursuing breakthrough general-purpose AI models could ultimately validate Apple's more conservative strategy of developing specific AI features that enhance the user experience. In that sense, its privacy-first policy may not be the straitjacket it first seemed. Apple plans to expand Apple Intelligence features next month with the release of iOS 18.2 and then via further updates through 2025.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/13/ai-companies-struggle-improve-llms/">AI Companies Reportedly Struggling to Improve Latest Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ai-companies-reportedly-struggling-to-improve-latest-models.2442858/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models powered by M4 Pro and M4 Max chips introduce Thunderbolt 5 connectivity to the Mac lineup for the first time, bringing the first major bandwidth increase since Thunderbolt 3 debuted in 2015. While this next-generation standard promises significant improvements, understanding its specific benefits can help you decide whether it's really essential for your needs. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/thunderbolt-5.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="size-full wp-image-910164" /> <br/>
Let's take a closer look at Thunderbolt 5 – what it does, whether it's necessary, and which accessories leverage the latest standard.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="thunderbolt_5:_what_it_does">Thunderbolt 5: What It Does</h2><br/>
Thunderbolt 5 doubles the standard data transfer speed to 80 Gbps in both directions, with a special "Bandwidth Boost" mode reaching up to 120 Gbps for video-intensive tasks. This asymmetrical mode allocates 120 Gbps to display data while maintaining 40 Gbps for other data transfers, effectively tripling the bandwidth compared to Thunderbolt 4. The standard also increases maximum power delivery to 240W, up from Thunderbolt 4's 100W limit, enabling faster charging for power-hungry devices like the 16-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/thunderbolt-5-specifications.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910163" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Intel specs: Thunderbolt 4 (today) vs. Thunderbolt 5 (tomorrow)</em></div><br/>
The increased bandwidth supports more demanding display configurations for M4 Pro and M4 Max-powered Macs. Thunderbolt 5 also incorporates DisplayPort 2.1, enabling features like 4K displays at 240Hz refresh rates, for smoother motion during gaming and video playback. Like previous versions, the standard maintains backward compatibility with older Thunderbolt standards and USB devices, including the latest USB4 2.0 specification.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="latest_macs_with_thunderbolt_5">Latest Macs With Thunderbolt 5</h2><br/>
Apple's latest Mac models featuring Thunderbolt 5 offer enhanced external display support, varying by specific chip configuration. Both the Mac mini with M4 Pro chip and MacBook Pro with M4 Pro or M4 Max chip provide three Thunderbolt 5 ports. Here's a detailed breakdown of what's capable in terms of display configurations:<br/>
 <br/>
 <h3 id="macbook_pro_models">MacBook Pro Models</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-MacBook-Pros-Thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974141" /><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li><strong>MacBook Pro with M4 Pro Chip:</strong></li><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>Supports up to two external displays:</li><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>Two displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt.</li><br/>
 <li>One display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI.</li><br/>
 </ul><br/>
 <li>Alternatively, supports one external display:</li><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>One display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz over HDMI.</li><br/>
 <li>One display with up to 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI.</li><br/>
 </ul><br/>
 </ul><br/>
 <br/>
 <li><strong>MacBook Pro with M4 Max Chip:</strong></li><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>Supports up to four external displays:</li><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>Three displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI.</li><br/>
 </ul><br/>
 <li>Alternatively, supports up to three external displays:</li><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>Two displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or one display with up to 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI.</li><br/>
 </ul><br/>
 </ul><br/>
 </ul><br/>
 <br/>
 <h3 id="mac_mini_models">Mac mini Models</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-mini-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973741" /><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Mac mini with M4 Pro Chip:</strong></li><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>Supports up to three external displays:</li><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>Three displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt.</li><br/>
 </ul><br/>
 <li>Alternatively, supports one external display:</li><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>One display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or one display with up to 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI.</li><br/>
 </ul><br/>
 </ul><br/>
 </ul>Note that the Mac mini with the standard M4 chip features Thunderbolt 4 ports and supports up to three external displays, with specific configurations as detailed in Apple's technical specifications.<br/>
 <br/>
<h2 id="do_i_need_thunderbolt_5">Do I Need Thunderbolt 5?</h2><br/>
For most users performing everyday tasks like web browsing, document editing, or even photo editing, Thunderbolt 4's 40 Gbps bandwidth remains more than adequate. Even 4K video editing and working with large file sizes works smoothly with Thunderbolt 4 connections, as many professionals will attest. The new Mac mini and base 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 chip includes Thunderbolt 4 ports that should serve most of these users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/apple-thunderbolt-5-cable.jpg" alt="" width="2194" height="1234" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973730" /><br/>
It's worth considering Thunderbolt 5 if you work with 8K video, require multiple high-resolution displays, or regularly transfer extremely large files. The technology will be particularly beneficial if you work with virtual reality, 3D rendering, or high-end video production where every bit of bandwidth matters. However, remember that taking full advantage of Thunderbolt 5 requires compatible peripherals, which are just beginning to enter the market and typically command premium prices.<br/>
<br/>
For most users, the presence of Thunderbolt 5 shouldn't be the deciding factor when choosing between M4 and M4 Pro/Max Macs. The standard M4 models with Thunderbolt 4 will continue to serve the majority of users well, making Thunderbolt 5 a "nice-to-have" rather than a necessity for typical Mac buyers.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is set to release iOS 18.2 next month, bringing the second round of Apple Intelligence features to iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models. This update brings several major advancements to Apple's AI integration, including completely new image generation tools and a range of Visual Intelligence-based enhancements. There are a handful of new non-AI related feature controls incoming as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/New-Things-Your-iPhone-Can-Do-in-iOS-18.2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972921" /><br/>
While not all advertised Apple Intelligence features will be available immediately, iOS 18.2 introduces several capabilities that aim to make your iPhone smarter and more intuitive. Below, we've listed 18 new things your iPhone will be able to do when the update rolls out in December.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Share AirTag Location With Trusted Friend or Airline</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iOS-18-2-Share-Item-Location.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976718" /><br/>
Find My has a new option to Share Item Location with an "airline or trusted person" that can help you locate something that you've misplaced. Choosing the Share Item Location option creates a link that lets someone view the location of a lost item when they open the link.<br/>
<br/>
The link can be opened on a non-Apple device, so an iPhone or Mac is not required to provide someone with your item's location. Links expire after a week or when you're reunited with your lost item. More than 15 airlines will offer the feature, which will be integrated into each airline's customer service process for locating mishandled or delayed baggage, according to Apple. In addition to items equipped with an AirTag, the feature also works with third-party accessories and item trackers that support the Find My network.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Require Screen On for Camera Control</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iOS-18-2-Beta-3-Camera-Control-Screen-On-Setting.jpg" alt="" width="1206" height="461" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976875" /><br/>
On iPhone 16 models, under "Display & Brightness" in the Settings app, there is a new Camera Control toggle called Require Screen On. When enabled, this setting requires that your iPhone screen is illuminated before a press of the Camera Control button will open the Camera app or a compatible third-party camera app. It's a handy option if you find yourself pressing the button accidentally.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Lock Auto Exposure and Auto Focus</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-capture-button.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964713" /><br/>
By applying light pressure on the Camera Control button on iPhone 16 models, you can now lock auto focus and auto exposure settings. The lock remains active until you release your finger from the button. Enabling the feature involves navigating to Settings ➝ Camera ➝ Camera Control and toggling on the AE/AF Lock option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>View Video Fullscreen in Photos</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/photos-ios-18-2-video-fullscreen-playback.jpeg" alt="photos" width="5386" height="3030" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977081" /><br/>
When iOS 18 was released in September, it brought a major redesign to the Photos app on the iPhone, but some of the updates received mixed feedback. Since announcing iOS 18, Apple has made ongoing adjustments to the app, and that looks set to continue in iOS 18.2. In the latest beta, the video player has been updated to occupy more screen space, removing the thick borders seen in earlier iOS 18 versions. Now, videos display in full screen without needing a tap to expand them.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Mirroring With Hotspot</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-iphone-mirroring.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956750" /><br/>
With iOS 18.2, you can now use iPhone Mirroring even while your iPhone’s hotspot connection is shared with your Mac. Previously, connecting your Mac through Personal Hotspot prevented the use of iPhone Mirroring.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Track Safari Download Progress</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iOS-18.2-Safari-Downloads-on-Lock-Screen-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975839" /><br/>
With iOS 18.2, tracking your Safari downloads should be more effortless and immediate, since you can keep an eye on download progress right from your iPhone's Lock Screen. On iPhone 14 Pro models and newer, it also appears in the Dynamic Island.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Adjust Media Volume on Lock Screen</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-volume-control-lock-screen.jpg" alt="" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973093" /><br/>
Prior to 2022, the volume slider was a familiar presence on the Lock Screen whenever media was playing. When Apple released iOS 16, however, it removed the control without explaining the reason, much to the dismay of many users.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, Apple is bringing the control back as an option in iOS 18.2. If you're already on the iOS 18.2 beta, you'll find a toggle in Settings ➝ Accessibility ➝ Audio & Visual, labeled "Always Show Volume Control". Enable the switch, and you'll be able to adjust volume from the Lock Screen without having to unlock your ‌iPhone‌ or use the physical volume buttons.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Play Daily Sudoku Puzzles</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Sudoku-Apple-News-iOS-18.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972812" /><br/>
With iOS 18.2, Apple News+ subscribers in the U.S. will gain access to daily sudoku puzzles, offering easy, moderate, and challenging difficulty levels. A scoreboard will keep track of your sudoku statistics, including the total number of puzzles solved and your fastest completion times for each difficulty level. This addition will be the fourth puzzle game available with an Apple News+ subscription, joining Crossword, Crossword Mini, and Quartiles.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Easily Manage Default Apps</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-default-apps.jpg" alt="" width="4470" height="2514" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972355" /><br/>
iOS 18.2 includes a new "Default Apps" section that can be found in the Settings app, which can be used to manage your default apps for the iPhone. This is a feature that Apple promised would be coming to the European Union, but it looks as if it may become available worldwide, based on the beta.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/when-apple-intelligence-launches-eu/">When Is Apple Intelligence Launching in the European Union?</a></li></ul><br/>
In the latest beta, US users can access the Default App interface to choose their preferred Email, Call Filtering, Browser, and Passwords, and Keyboards. EU users should have more options for choosing non-Apple apps as their default, as they are able to delete core apps like Messages, App Store, Safari, Camera, and Photos.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Adjust Camera Control Double-Click Speed</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/camera-control-double-click-speed.jpeg" alt="settings" width="5386" height="3030" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977086" /><br/>
A new option in Settings ➝ Accessibility ➝ Camera Control allows you to adjust the double-click speed for the Camera Control button. The available options are Default, Slow, and Slower. The settings are added alongside existing options to adjust the speed of the double light press and the force of the light press.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Categorize Emails in Mail</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-mail-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957054" /><br/>
In iOS 18.2, Apple is introducing an updated version of the Mail app for built-in categorization. Mail Categories effectively organize your incoming emails into distinct sections for easier navigation. <br/>
<br/>
Important emails are grouped in a "Primary" category, while other types are categorized into three additional sections. The "Transactions" section streamlines access to receipts, orders, and shipping information, allowing you to quickly locate your purchases. Meanwhile, the "Updates" section gathers newsletters, appointment reminders, and various subscription emails, keeping you informed. Lastly, the "Promotions" category highlights special offers and promotional messages, to make sure you don’t miss out on any deals.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Generate Images Using Prompts</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-image-playground-styles.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972930" /><br/>
Image Playground is a totally new app designed to help you create images based on your ideas. Similar to ChatGPT, you can generate images by providing a prompt, and Apple offers suggested categories like themes, locations, and costumes to inspire your creativity. The app specializes in stylized content, meaning the generated images won't be realistic, but can choose from Animation and Illustration styles. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, you can include likenesses of friends and family by pulling images directly from your Photos app. While Image Playground functions as a standalone app, it can also be integrated into apps like Notes and Messages and added to third-party applications.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Get an iPhone Charge Time Estimate</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-16-Battery-Life-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-971681" /><br/>
In iOS 18.2, newly discovered code suggests you may be able to get notified about how long it will take your iPhone to reach a specific charge level. This would build upon iOS 18's existing battery health capabilities, which include new options to limit maximum charging to 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% to help preserve long-term battery health. iOS 18 also now alerts users when their iPhone is being charged with a slower-than-optimal charger.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Create Custom Emoji Characters</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iOS-18-Genmoji-WWDC.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973017" /><br/>
Genmoji are akin to traditional emojis but offer enhanced functionality. With Genmoji, you can create virtually any emoji you desire, freeing you from the limitations of the standard emoji set. <br/>
<br/>
While they function like emojis on Apple devices, they are not encoded characters from the Unicode Consortium. Instead, Apple developed a unique API for Genmoji, ensuring they display correctly in any application that supports rich text. You can generate a Genmoji by providing a description of your desired design, and you even have the option to create Genmoji that resemble individuals from your Photos library.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Query ChatGPT via Siri</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg" alt="" width="1825" height="1027" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960667" /><br/>
Apple is collaborating with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT into the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This partnership allows Siri to handle complex requests by referring them to ChatGPT, such as generating images or creating text from scratch. With the Writing Tools feature, ChatGPT can produce and illustrate original content, expanding its capabilities beyond what Siri can currently offer.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, you can open a lengthy PDF and ask Siri to summarize information on a specific topic; Siri can then pass this request to ChatGPT to generate a comprehensive summary. Apple envisions Siri as a facilitator for AI models and tools, optimizing available resources to provide you with answers without the need to switch between multiple apps.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>View ChatGPT Limits</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-chatgpt-plus.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975428" /><br/>
As part of Apple's collab with OpenAI, iPhone users can access ChatGPT for free but are limited to a small number of requests using the latest ChatGPT-4 turbo engine and a limited number of DALL-E 3 image generations. To that extent, the Apple Intelligence & Siri section in Settings will display ChatGPT limits for free users, but it also provides an option to upgrade to the paid ChatGPT Plus plan. Once these limits are reached, access reverts to a more basic version of ChatGPT, which is less costly for OpenAI to maintain. Full access requires a ChatGPT Plus subscription, priced at &#36;19.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Visual Intelligence</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Visual-Intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970984" /><br/>
If you have an iPhone 16, you can make use of Visual Intelligence, a feature that offers insights about your surroundings. For instance, when you open the camera and aim it at a restaurant, you'll receive details such as opening hours and reviews.<br/>
<br/>
Additional capabilities of Visual Intelligence include reading text aloud, identifying phone numbers and addresses for adding to Contacts, copying text, and summarizing information. Users can also search Google to find where to purchase a specific item they see, and by pointing the camera at an object, they can access further information through ChatGPT. Apple intends to enhance this feature by introducing more functionalities in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Options in Writing Tools</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/apple-intelligence-writing-tools-rewrite.jpg" alt="notes" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973241" /><br/>
Apple is upgrading the Writing Tools feature to include options for more open-ended modifications. In iOS 18.1, Writing Tools can only adjust the tone to friendly, professional, or a simplified version. However, with the release of iOS 18.2, users will be able to specify the desired tone or content changes, such as incorporating more action words or transforming an email into a poem.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/13/new-things-your-iphone-can-do-in-ios-18-2/">18 New Things Your iPhone Can Do in iOS 18.2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/18-new-things-your-iphone-can-do-in-ios-18-2.2442846/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 18, Apple has introduced a clever new way to identify if your iPhone charging setup is running at less than optimal speeds. The new feature appears directly in Settings, making it easy to spot when you're not getting the fastest possible charge.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-slow-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1534" height="863" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955072" /><br/>
The Battery section displays a <strong>Slow Charger</strong> message when your iPhone detects a "slow" charger in use. You'll also see charging periods with an orange bar. This visual indicator appears in both the 24-hour and 10-day battery usage views.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What Makes a Charger "Slow"?</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>Wired chargers providing 7.5W or less power</li><br/>
  <li>Standard Qi1 wireless chargers (less than 10W)</li><br/>
  <li>USB ports in cars or hubs</li><br/>
  <li>Chargers with multiple connected devices sharing power</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Common Causes of Slow Charging</h2><br/>
Several situations can slow down your iPhone's charging speed. A counterfeit charger could be the culprit, for example. Even some authentic third-party wireless chargers claim MagSafe compatibility but only deliver standard Qi charging speeds.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-battery-slow-charging.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955071" /><br/>
If you keep accessories like headphones connected during wireless charging, your device automatically limits power to 7.5W to meet safety standards. Running demanding apps, playing graphics-intensive games, or streaming video at high brightness while charging can also reduce charging speeds as your iPhone manages power and heat. Lastly, it's worth bearing in mind that charging in a warm environment may cause your iPhone to temporarily pause charging until the temperature falls. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Get Faster Charging Speeds</h2><br/>
To get the fastest possible charging speeds, you'll want to use a USB-C Power Delivery charger along with the appropriate cable - USB-C for iPhone 15 and later, or USB-C to Lightning for earlier models. Alternatively, you can opt for either Apple's MagSafe Charger or any Qi2-certified wireless charger, both of which provide significantly faster charging than standard Qi chargers.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/tell-if-you-are-using-slow-iphone-charger/">How to Tell If You&#039;re Using a Slow iPhone Charger</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-tell-if-youre-using-a-slow-iphone-charger.2442817/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mophie has three new Qi2 charging accessories available as of today from Apple retail stores, including a 3-in-1 Travel Charger, a Wireless Charging Vent Mount, and a Magnetic Vent Mount.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/mophie-new-travel-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2132" height="1199" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977181" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRX62ZM/A/mophie-3-in-1-travel-charger-magsafe-compatible">&#36;150 3-in-1 Travel Charger</a> features a Qi2 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charging surface for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, which can provide up to 15W to a compatible &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. It also has an Apple Watch charger that offers up to 7.5W for fast charging Apple Watch Series 7 models and later, and a 5W AirPods charging surface.<br/>
<br/>
A 40W wall adapter is included for charging all three devices at once, and it comes with international plug configurations for the United States, UK, European Union, and Australia. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charging surface can be used while flat or while lifted up, and in the lifted mode, it is compatible with StandBy.<br/>
<br/>
The charger folds up in half so that it can easily be tucked away in a backpack or a suitcase when traveling, plus Mophie includes a Travel Case that holds the charger and the power adapter that comes with it.<br/>
<br/>
Mophie's <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRX72ZM/A/mophie-magnetic-wireless-charging-car-vent-mount-magsafe-compatible">&#36;70 Wireless Car Vent Mount</a> provides up to 15W for charging a compatible &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with Qi2. It is designed to connect to a vent using an adjustable hook, and it has a wide base that holds the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; securely in place.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/mophie-car-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977184" /><br/>
The mount can tilt and swivel so that the viewing angle can be optimally adjusted, and one hand can be used to mount the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and remove it. The vent attachment works on car vents up to 41mm deep, and Mophie includes a USB-C to USB-C cable, a 20W USB-C car adapter, and two cable management clips.<br/>
<br/>
If in-car charging isn't needed, Mophie also has a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRX82ZM/A/mophie-magnetic-car-vent-mount">&#36;30 Car Vent Mount</a> that holds an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in place via &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, allowing it to be used for navigation, hands-free calls, and more. With the exception of charging capabilities, it is identical to the Wireless Mount, featuring multiple viewing angles, one-handed operation, and a strong magnetic hold.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a new Gold Link Bracelet, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXMC3AM/A/42mm-gold-link-bracelet">which is available for &#36;349</a>. The band was first shown off when Apple introduced new Apple Watch Series 10 models, but it was not available for purchase in September.<br/>
<br/>

The gold version of the Link Bracelet is identical to the natural and slate options, but it is designed to match the stainless steel Apple Watch Series 10 that comes in the same gold color. It is made from 316L stainless steel alloy with a custom butterfly closure.<br/>
<br/>
Apple sells the Gold Link Bracelet in both 42mm and 46mm sizes to fit all Apple Watch models. The 46mm version fits 44mm to 49mm Apple Watch models, while the 42mm model fits 38mm to 42mm models. Apple is also selling a kit <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXMJ3AM/A/46mm-gold-link-bracelet-kit">with additional links</a> for larger wrists. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two months after being announced, Apple has quietly released the new Gold Link Bracelet. &#36;350, arrives around Christmas. <a href="https://t.co/baDk6wygcf">pic.twitter.com/baDk6wygcf</a></p>&mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1856461088440631530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has considered building its own line of smart home accessories, reports <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-12/apple-home-hub-detailed-apple-intelligence-homeos-square-ipad-like-design"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple could manufacture smart home cameras and other devices that would connect to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> smart home platform and that would tie in with a planned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/">smart home "command center"</a> that could come out as soon as next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-977115" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/homekit-showdown-redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
As one example, Gurman suggests Apple could create an indoor security camera that could also be used as a baby monitor, which is in line with a report we heard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/kuo-apple-smart-home-camera-and-more-2026/">from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo claimed that Apple is designing a smart home camera that will be manufactured starting in 2026, with Apple planning to sell "tens of millions" of the devices over the long term. Kuo says that the cameras that Apple is working on will have wireless connectivity and deep integration with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does not seem as sure that Apple will follow through on plans to create its own smart home products. He says that it's something Apple is "exploring" that could be prioritized should its upcoming smart home hub device turn out to be a success.<br/>
<br/>
Apple would likely emphasize privacy with its smart home cameras, providing an alternative to cameras from companies like Amazon's Ring and Google's Nest. Ring has been derided for its privacy policies over the years, primarily because it had a "Request for Assistance" tool that allowed law enforcement officials to request video footage from Ring customers. Ring has provided police officers with Ring camera footage without notifying users, and reserves the right to do so in emergency situations. Google's Nest brand also says that it will provide police with smart home camera footage in emergency situations without a warrant.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is known for having strong privacy protections, and it is possible that customers would trust a smart home camera from Apple more than a smart home camera from a company like Ring. Apple already designed a &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; protocol for cameras called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/">HomeKit Secure Video</a>, which is end-to-end encrypted.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to coming out with any smart home accessories, Apple plans to release an iPad-like smart home display that will serve as a home hub. The smart home device, which is set to come out as soon as March 2025, will run apps and will control &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; and Matter-based accessories.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/">Apple Smart Home Display</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home/">Home</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-smart-home-products/">Apple Might Make Smart Home Products Like Cameras</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-might-make-smart-home-products-like-cameras.2442804/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to launch an AI-powered smart home display as soon as March 2025, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-12/apple-home-hub-detailed-apple-intelligence-homeos-square-ipad-like-design"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The display will measure in at approximately six inches, and while it is similar to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, it is square rather than rectangular and it has thick bezels around the edges. There is a camera at the top front so that it can be used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, plus there are internal speakers for playing music and a built-in rechargeable battery.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/iPad-iOS-16-WP-Display-Feature-eric-edit.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881759" /><br/>
Apple will offer the hub in silver and black, and it will use a touch-based interface. The operating system will look like a mix of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s StandBy mode and watchOS, though it will primarily be controlled by voice. Apple plans to integrate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> for accessing apps and controlling smart home products, and it was designed around App Intents, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> system that will be able to control apps and tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple designed a customizable home screen with widgets that can be used to show things like the weather and upcoming appointments, a photo slideshow, or important home controls. A software-based dock will be available for launching apps, and multiple systems in different rooms will work as intercoms. Apple plans to focus on security as well, providing alerts and camera footage from connected smart home cameras.<br/>
<br/>
Built-in sensors will be able to determine how close a person is standing to the device, and it can adjust features from there. When no one is nearby, for example, it might show the temperature, but as someone approaches, it can switch to an interface for adjusting the thermostat, much like Nest thermostats. It could also detect how many people are nearby using external sensors that plug into outlets throughout the home, but Apple may or may not manufacture these extra sensors.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to offering smart home controls and FaceTiming features, the device will include several Apple apps like Safari, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/">Apple News</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, Notes, Calendar, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, but there will not be a dedicated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Apple is designing different attachments, such as a plate for attaching it to the wall and a base with additional speakers for using it in a central location in the home.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to position the smart display as a "command center," with the aim of furthering Apple's position in the smart home market. The smart home hub has been in development for more than three years, and Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> has been pushing the engineering and design teams to prioritize the device. It will be a standalone device, but it is meant to work in concert with other Apple products and will require an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for setup.<br/>
<br/>
With the smart home hub, Apple is looking to compete with Amazon and Google, who have similar devices. Amazon has the Echo Hub, and Google offers the Nest Hub Max. Apple will likely need to price the device similarly to these products, and the Echo Hub costs &#36;150, while the Nest Hub Max costs &#36;230.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple has considered creating its own line of smart home accessories like an indoor security camera, it is not yet clear if the company will do so. Apple could get into accessories if the smart home display is a success. Earlier this week, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that Apple was working on a smart home camera with wireless connectivity and deep integration with &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, with Apple planning to launch the device in 2026.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, Apple plans to release a robotic version of the smart home hub that can move the screen around, Gurman reports.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/">Apple Smart Home Display</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/">Apple to Launch AI-Powered Home &#039;Command Center&#039; as Soon as March 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-ai-powered-home-command-center-as-soon-as-march-2025.2442799/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Likely Planning to Release iOS 18.2 on December 9</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple previously confirmed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-confirms-ios-18-2-december-launch/">iOS 18.2 will be released in December</a>, and now a potential release date within the month has surfaced.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Generic-iOS-18.2-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972123" /><br/>
We believe that Apple is likely planning to release iOS 18.2 on Monday, December 9, based on a <a href="https://community.ee.co.uk/t5/Mobile-Services/Calls-on-other-devices-ending/td-p/1471238">recent notice</a> that British carrier EE provided to its customers. In the notice, EE said it will be discontinuing an iPhone feature known as "Wi-Fi calling on other supported iCloud-connected devices" on December 9. The feature enables users to make Wi-Fi calls on devices like the iPad and Mac, even when their iPhone is not nearby.<br/>
<br/>
The second developer beta of iOS 18.2 last week came bundled with a <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-2-beta-2-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2441979/">new EE carrier settings version</a> numbered 60.5.2, up from 59.5.1 on the first iOS 18.2 beta and iOS 18.1. The new carrier settings version removed the "Add Wi-Fi Calling For Other Devices" toggle from the Wi-Fi Calling section in the Settings app on iPhones used by EE customers, in line with the carrier announcing that it will stop offering the feature next month.<br/>
<br/>
Most carrier setting updates are bundled with iOS updates, aside from ones with bug fixes, so EE has likely indirectly revealed that iOS 18.2 will be released on December 9. We are not absolutely certain about this date, but it is a very likely possibility.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2 being released on December 9 would not be very surprising. Apple already said the update was coming next month, many iOS updates are released on Mondays, and the second half of the month is pretty much ruled out due to the holiday season. Nevertheless, you can now mark your calendars a little more precisely.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2 includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-2-beta-features/">additional Apple Intelligence features</a> for iPhone 15 Pro models and all iPhone 16 models, including Genmoji, Image Playground, ChatGPT integration for Siri, and more. On all compatible iPhones, the update also adds a new Defaults section in the Settings app, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/apple-announces-airtag-location-sharing/">item location sharing feature in the Find My app</a>, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular repair site iFixit today disassembled one of Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a> machines for a teardown video that gives us a more complete look at the inside of the device.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="M4 Mac mini Teardown - UPGRADABLE SSD, Powerful, and TINY" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtdGxBeSkz8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Compared to the prior version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, the M4 model is densely packed with little space between components, which is how Apple slimmed down the size so much. The &zwnj;M4 Mac mini&zwnj; measures in at 5x5 inches, down from 7.5x7.5 inches, a size reduction that makes a major difference.<br/>
<br/>
The power supply module is a board that extends across the top of the case, a design that Apple has previously used for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>. The power supply normally takes up a lot of space, so that's how Apple shrunk it down without compromising performance.<br/>
<br/>
In the middle of the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, there's a fan that works with the redesigned thermal management system of the machine to pull in air from the environment, circulate it through each level of the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, and then vent it out through the bottom. Because the M4 Pro versions of the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; need more cooling power, Apple equipped them with a larger copper heatsink than the heatsink in the standard &zwnj;M4 Mac mini&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit is a little late to the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; teardown, which means we have seen <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-teardown/">prior videos</a> that provided some insight into the machine's internal components. We've already learned that the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/09/more-teardown-and-storage-upgrade/">modular storage</a> that can technically be upgraded after purchase, and iFixit confirmed that. iFixit swapped a 512GB SSD from one &zwnj;M4 Mac mini&zwnj; to another &zwnj;M4 Mac mini&zwnj; that had a 256GB SSD, and the swap was successful.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 and M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; models use different NAND modules that aren't physically interchangeable, and iFixit was not able to use an M4 SSD in an M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, so users who plan to swap out their own storage will need to make sure to get the correct SSD for their device.<br/>
<br/>
RAM for the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is tightly integrated into the M4 chip inside and is not upgradeable after purchase, and the ports are also soldered, which can make replacement difficult.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit found other components in the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; are simple to swap out, and the site gave the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; a repairability score of 7 out of 10 thanks to the easy to remove components, swappable SSD, and the detailed repair manuals that Apple made available. iFixit says users could get at least a decade of use out of the &zwnj;M4 Mac mini&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/ifixit-m4-mac-mini-teardown/">iFixit Shares M4 Mac Mini Teardown</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-shares-m4-mac-mini-teardown.2442793/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today overhauled <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-store-connect/id1234793120">the App Store Connect app</a> designed for developers, introducing version 2.0. Developers use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Connect to distribute and manage their apps for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Mac, Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and Vision Pro.<br/>

&zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect 2.0 includes a refreshed UI throughout the app, as well as new capabilities. Developers are able to promote their apps by generating marketing assets for app launches, version updates, featured placements in the Today tab, and more.<br/>
<br/>
These marketing assets that are generated for special moments can be shared on various social media channels for app promotion purposes.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of an upcoming visionOS 2.2 update to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a little over a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/apple-releases-ios-18-2-beta-2/">first visionOS 2.2 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" /><br/>
visionOS 2.2 can be installed by going to the Software Update section of the Settings app on the Vision Pro and opting into Beta Updates.<br/>
<br/>
The visionOS 2.2 update adds a new feature for the Mac Virtual Display option, allowing it to be set to Wide and Ultrawide. The Ultrawide setting is equivalent to two 4K displays side-by-side, and it is a notable improvement over the current Mac Virtual Display that's available in visionOS 2.1.<br/>
<br/>
The Mac Virtual Display allows the Vision Pro to be connected to a Mac with the Vision Pro serving as the display for the machine. The virtual Mac desktop works just like a standard desktop with an external display, but Vision Pro does not support multiple displays. As a solution, Apple has added the option for a wider display to maximize space.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-seeds-visionos-2-2-beta-2/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of visionOS 2.2 to Developers With Ultrawide Mac Virtual Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-visionos-2-2-to-developers-with-ultrawide-mac-virtual-display.2442782/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second public betas of upcoming iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2 updates, allowing the public to continue testing new features ahead of when the software launches. The public betas come a day after Apple provided developers with new betas.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972123" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Generic-iOS-18.2-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Public beta testers can download the updates from the Settings app on each device after opting into the beta through Apple's public beta testing website. Note that Apple has also released public betas for watchOS 11.2, tvOS 18.2, and the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> software. <br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; introduce the next <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features, including the first image generation capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
The update adds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, a new app for creating images based on text descriptions. You can enter anything you want, though Apple will suggest costumes, locations, items, and more to add to an image. There are options to create characters that resemble your friends and family, and you can choose a photo for &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; to use as inspiration to create a related image. Elements added to &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; creations are previewed, and there is a preview history so you can undo a change and go back to a prior version.<br/>
<br/>
While &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; is a standalone app, it is also integrated into Messages, Notes, Freeform, and more. &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; does not make photorealistic images and is instead limited to animation or illustration styles.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, which are customizable emoji characters that you can create based on descriptions and phrases. Like &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; creations, you can base them on your friends and family, with the data pulled from the People album in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>. You can also make characters using basic elements, and you'll get multiple &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; suggestions to choose from. You can create &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; using the emoji keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; are limited to iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 right now, and will be coming to &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; later.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> in iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.2 has ChatGPT integration. If &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is unable to provide an answer to a question, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will hand the request over to ChatGPT, though &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will need user permission first. ChatGPT will answer the question and relay the information back through &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
ChatGPT can be used to create content from scratch, including text and images. No account is required to use ChatGPT integration, and Apple and OpenAI do not store requests.<br/>
<br/>
If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, there's a Visual Intelligence feature in iOS 18.2 that provides information about what's around you. Open up the camera and point it at a restaurant to get reviews, or point it at an item to search Google for it.<br/>
<br/>
Some other Visual Intelligence capabilities include reading text out loud, detecting phone numbers and addresses to add them to Contacts, copying text, and summarizing text.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added Writing Tools in iOS 18.1, but in iOS 18.2, you can more freely describe the tone or content change that you want to make, such as adding more action words, or turning an email into a poem.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; now supports localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and the UK in addition to U.S. English.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wait List</h2><br/>
If you've already been testing &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; and are opted in, you will have access to Writing Tools, ChatGPT integration, and Visual Intelligence automatically.<br/>
<br/>
There is a secondary waiting list for early access to use &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;, &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, and Image Wand. You can sign up to get access in &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; or in the areas where you access &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; or Image Wand.<br/>
<br/>
When you request access, you are added to a wait list for all three capabilities and you'll get a notification when the features are available for you to use. Apple will roll out access over time.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Availability and Compatibility</h2><br/>
The public betas are available on all devices, but the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features require a device capable of &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is still working on refining the new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; tools, and the company warns that &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;, Image Wand, and &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; can sometimes give you results you weren't expecting. Apple is collecting feedback on these experiences and will refine them over time.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Release Date</h2><br/>
Apple is expected to release the iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.2, watchOS 11.2, tvOS 18.2, and visionOS 2.2 updates in early December.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/ios-18-2-public-beta-2/">Apple Seeds Second Public Betas of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 With New Apple Intelligence Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-public-betas-of-ios-18-2-ipados-18-2-and-macos-sequoia-15-2-with-new-apple-intelligence-features.2442781/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today announced several new features for the Chrome browser that's available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, with the new additions aimed at providing users with more intuitive ways for finding information and completing tasks. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" /><br/>
Google Lens now supports searching with images and text at the same time, rather than search being limited to just an image. Users can add words to a visual query to refine results and conduct more complex searches. <br/>
<br/>
Google Drive and Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> users can now save content from the web directly to those services from Chrome, freeing up on-device storage space. To save a file to Google Drive from Chrome, tap on the Google Drive option. Saving an image to &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; from Chrome can be done by long pressing on the image and then selecting the Save in Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; option.<br/>
<br/>
For U.S. users, Chrome on iOS is gaining Shopping Insights, which are designed to better surface deals. If Chrome has Shopping Insights for a product that a user is searching for, there will be a "Good Deal Now" notification in the address bar. The feature requires signing into Chrome and toggling on "Make Searches and Browsing Better."<br/>
<br/>
When viewing a map of an address in Chrome, users will soon be able to tap an underlined address and see a more detailed mini-map of the location directly in the browser without having to swap over to Google Maps. Google says that it is experimenting with this feature and will roll it out globally over the coming months. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/kuo-apple-smart-home-camera-and-more-2026/">add more health-related features to future AirPods models</a>, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and the upcoming Powerbeats Pro 2 might offer a hint.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/AirPods-4-Ambient-Light-Heart-Health-Sensor-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977087" /><br/>
We previously reported that the Powerbeats Pro 2 will offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/powerbeats-pro-2-heart-rate/">heart rate monitoring during workouts</a>, and perhaps that feature will extend to AirPods in the future. Based on our iOS 18 code findings, you will be able to connect the Powerbeats Pro 2 to gym equipment like a treadmill to measure heart rate, and the data will be visible in the Health app and other supported apps on the iPhone. Apple previously announced that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/06/what-to-expect-from-powerbeats-pro-2/">Powerbeats Pro 2 will be released in 2025</a>, and AirPods Pro 3 are also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/06/airpods-pro-3-everything-we-know/">rumored to launch next year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Heart rate monitoring has in fact been rumored for the AirPods Pro multiple times, but the feature has yet to come to fruition. With the feature now seemingly ready for Powerbeats Pro 2, though, it could finally come to AirPods too.<br/>
<br/>
AirPods are also rumored to gain body temperature sensing in the future, after the Apple Watch Series 8 and newer gained a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/track-your-nightly-wrist-temperature-apple-watch/">wrist temperature feature</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/powerbeats-pro-2-leak-hints-at-airpods-feature/">Powerbeats Pro 2 Leak Hints at Useful Health Feature Coming to AirPods</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/powerbeats-pro-2-leak-hints-at-useful-health-feature-coming-to-airpods.2442768/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The European Union has notified Apple that it may be violating EU anti-geo-blocking regulations with practices regarding its media services, giving the company one month to respond.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
The European Commission, in conjunction with the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5727">today announced</a> that it has formally notified Apple regarding potential breaches of the EU's anti-geo-blocking rules. This follows an investigation led by national consumer authorities from Belgium, Germany, and Ireland, coordinated by the European Commission. According to the Commission, Apple's practices appear to unlawfully restrict European consumers from accessing digital content based on their country of residence.<br/>
<br/>
According to the CPC Network, consumers using Apple Media Services, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+, encounter different interfaces and content depending on their country of registration. This regional segmentation allegedly makes it difficult, if not impossible, for users to switch between country-specific versions of Apple's services, which may be in violation of the EU's Geo-blocking Regulation enacted in 2018, designed to protect the Digital Single Market.<br/>
<br/>
A significant point of concern for the EU authorities are restrictions on downloading apps. The investigation found that the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; does not allow users to download apps available in other EU countries. The EU maintains that consumers should be able to access and download apps offered in other EU/EEA countries when traveling or staying temporarily in another member state. <br/>
<br/>
Consumers are also only permitted to use credit or debit cards issued in the country where their Apple account was created. The Commission argues that consumers should be able to use any EU-issued payment method without facing unnecessary barriers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been given one month to formally respond to the Commission's findings and to propose potential commitments to align its practices with EU regulations. If Apple does not adequately address the concerns raised by the CPC Network, the company may face enforcement actions. The European Commission's latest action against Apple is part of a broader push to ensure that tech giants operating within the EU comply with the bloc's regulatory frameworks.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-pressure-to-remove-eu-geo-blocking/">Apple Under Pressure to Remove Geo-Blocking Restrictions in the EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-under-pressure-to-remove-geo-blocking-restrictions-in-the-eu.2442759/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Music Classical was updated today with CarPlay and Siri support, as well as stability and performance improvements, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Music-Classical-Carplay-Feature-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932168" /><br/>
CarPlay support was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-music-classical-carplay/">briefly added</a> to a previous version of Apple Music Classical earlier this year, but it was removed just hours later. Starting with version 2.1 today, the app is once again available on CarPlay, as shown in our screenshot below.<br/>
<br/>
CarPlay support provides Apple Music Classical listeners with access to their playlists, library, recommendations, and more on their vehicle's infotainment display. And with Siri on iOS 18.1 and later, users can also search via CarPlay for composers, artists, works, and instruments in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch, according to Apple. Additional languages will follow over time.<br/>
<br/>

Apple Music Classical <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/apple-music-classical-begins-rolling-out/">first launched in March 2023</a>, offering users with a standard Apple Music subscription access to over five million classical music tracks at no additional cost. The streaming app features advanced search functionality, exclusive artwork, extensive metadata, curated listening recommendations, and more. <br/>
<br/>
The app is available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music-classical/id1598433714">for the iPhone and iPad</a>, as well as Android. It is based on Primephonic, a classical music streaming service <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/apple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-service/">acquired by Apple in 2021</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music-classical/">Apple Music Classical</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-music-classical-carplay-and-siri-support/">Apple Music Classical Updated With CarPlay and Siri Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-classical-updated-with-carplay-and-siri-support.2442756/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.owc.com">OWC</a> today announced its new <a href="https://www.owc.com/news/other-world-computing-launches-owc-thunderbolt-5-hub-opening-a-new-world-of-workflow-possibilities-and-performance">Thunderbolt 5 Hub</a>, one of the first accessories to support Intel's latest Thunderbolt standard, and offering Thunderbolt 5 compatibility with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/">new Mac mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-macbook-pro-models/">MacBook Pro Models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips</a>. <br/>

The hub converts a single Thunderbolt port into three Thunderbolt 5 ports and one USB-A port, and delivers up to 80Gb/s bi-directional data transfer speeds. It can achieve speeds up to twice as fast as Thunderbolt 4, with bandwidth up to 120Gb/s available for display connections, and supports connecting up to three 8K displays at 60Hz with Display Stream Compression, making it suitable for demanding visual workflows.<br/>

In terms of charging output, the hub provides up to 140W power delivery, which is enough for a 16-inch MacBook Pro, while the aluminum enclosure features passive cooling for silent operation.<br/>
<br/>
OWC is keen to emphasize backward compatibility with Thunderbolt 3/4 and USB-C devices, allowing users to connect both newer and legacy peripherals. The hub also enables the creation of three separate device daisy chains that can operate independently.<br/>

By turning a single cable connection into three Thunderbolt 5 ports and one USB-A port, the OWC Thunderbolt 5 Hub breaks the connectivity handcuffs of host machines not offering enough Thunderbolt 5 ports. With up to 80Gb/s of bi-directional data speed – up to 2x faster than Thunderbolt 4 and USB4 – and up to 120Gb/s for higher display bandwidth needs, the OWC Thunderbolt 5 Hub redefines productivity. Connect portable SSDs exceeding 6000MB/s, up to three 8K displays @ 60Hz with DSC, today's USB-C connector compatible devices, and yesterday's USB-A desktop accessories. All while keeping modern notebooks powered and charged up for mobile use with 140 watts.</blockquote><br/>
