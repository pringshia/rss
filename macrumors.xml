		<description><![CDATA[Adobe today updated its Illustrator and Photoshop Creative Cloud apps, introducing a range of new features that streamline productivity. Many of the additions take advantage of generative AI and machine learning to save creators time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/adobe-photoshop-selection-brush-tool.jpg" alt="" width="1170" height="876" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959738" /><br/>
Photoshop has a <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/07/23/supercharge-core-creative-workflows-adobe-photoshops-latest-update">new Selection Brush Tool</a> for selecting areas by brushing over them without having to use the Quick Mask mode. The tool has opacity and hardness settings for feathered edges, allowing for more seamless selections.<br/>
<br/>
The Adjustment Brush Tool, which has been in beta, is also available. It allows for painting on adjustments to brightness, saturation, and more, with options for fine tuning selections. Photoshop's Generate Image text to image feature is also out of beta, and it can be used to generate dozens of ideas in minutes using a text prompt and/or reference images.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/photoshop-generate-image.jpg" alt="" width="1170" height="876" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959739" /><br/>
Other new Photoshop features include an improved Contextual Task Bar, support for bulleted and numbered lists, and an Enhance Detail option for Generative Fill.<br/>
<br/>
Adobe Illustrator has a Generative Shape Fill feature for filling shapes with detail and color. Adobe says that users can match the style and color of their own artwork to create multiple editable and scalable vector graphic options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/adobe-illustrator-generative-shape-fill.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959737" /><br/>
Text prompts are used to fill vector graphics for Generative Shape Fill, and there are options to add styles like 3D, geometric, or pixel art.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Breaking down new Generative Shape Fill (beta) in Illustrator w/ Paul Trani Adobe Creative Cloud" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwoKOvONq38" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Adobe improved the Text to Pattern feature in Illustrator, making it simpler to create, edit, and scale seamless vector patterns. Vector graphics that are generated using the feature are crisper, plus there are new UI controls and better editing options.<br/>
<br/>
With Mockup, designers can see their creations on objects like product packaging and apparel, with the tool automatically adjusting art to fit the edges of the object. Other new features in Illustrator include the Dimension tool for precise sizing, enhanced selection capabilities, and faster pan and zoom speeds.<br/>
<br/>
These new features are available in the latest versions of Illustrator and Photoshop on the desktop.

		<description><![CDATA[Shortly after the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max were released last September, some customers began to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">experience an issue with the devices overheating</a>. Apple eventually mitigated the problem <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">with an iOS 17 update</a>, but it might go a step further with the iPhone 16 models that are set to be released later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature-White.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911430" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone"><em>The Information</em> today</a> cited a source who said that iPhone 16 models will be equipped with a "larger graphite sheet" inside the chassis of the devices, to address potential overheating. This corroborates a rumor from last November that claimed iPhone 16 models would feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">improved thermal management system</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release the iPhone 16 series in September, so the devices should be just a few months away from launching. With this rumored change, the post-launch overheating issue should be a thing of the past.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/internal-change-to-iphone-16-models-expected-to-reduce-overheating/">Internal Change to iPhone 16 Models Expected to Reduce Overheating</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/internal-change-to-iphone-16-models-expected-to-reduce-overheating.2432085/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone SE 4 Production Will Reportedly Begin Ramping Up in October</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Following nearly two years of rumors about a fourth-generation iPhone SE, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone"><em>The Information</em> today reported</a> that Apple suppliers are finally planning to begin ramping up mass production of the device in October of this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iPhone-SE-4-Vertical-Camera-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959379" /><br/>
If accurate, that timeframe would mean that the next iPhone SE would not be announced alongside the iPhone 16 series in September, as expected. Instead, the report speculates that the device could be released ahead of the Lunar New Year in January 2025. However,<br/>
all three existing iPhone SE models were announced in March over the years, so a March 2025 release seems quite possible too.<br/>
<br/>
Rumored features for the fourth-generation iPhone SE include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an Action button, and a USB-C port. The device is expected to be similar to the base iPhone 14, although reports said it would have only a single rear camera, and it might share the iPhone 16's rear-panel manufacturing process.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple released the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> today, introducing small changes to a number of features throughout the operating system. There are no big additions in this beta, but Apple is continuing to refine existing settings and design choices.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple plans to continue updating &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; over the next few months, with the update set to be released this fall. We've rounded up all of the changes that we've found in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 4 so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>CarPlay Wallpapers</h2><br/>
Apple added new Light Mode and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a> wallpaper options for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, and the new wallpaper mirrors the wallpapers that have been added on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here are all 8 new CarPlay wallpapers in iOS 18 beta 4<br><br>Lightmode (1/2) <a href="https://t.co/KQGvubg9ym">pic.twitter.com/KQGvubg9ym</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1815816335957327895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<h2>Settings</h2><br/>
Apple has added a new way to access <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> settings in the Settings app. There's now an &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; option paired with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Game Center, and Wallet. &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; settings can still be accessed by tapping on your Apple Account and choosing &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; from that interface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-beta-4-icloud-setting.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959729" /><br/>
<h2>Camera Controls</h2><br/>
In the Camera section of the Settings app, there is a new "Controls Menu" option under Preserve Settings. The Controls Menu preserves the previously used camera tool when expanding the controls menu rather than showing the full list of camera control options when using the Camera app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-controls-menu.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959728" /><br/>
<h2>Hidden Folder</h2><br/>
Apple has changed the design of the Hidden folder in the App Library. Rather than showing an icon of an eye with a line through it, it is now blanked out app squares, which makes it stand out less.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-hidden-folder-change.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959727" /><br/>
<h2>Dark Mode/Light Mode Icons</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; and Light Mode icons are now appropriately synced to the Light and &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; settings on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when you use the "Automatic" setting under Customize. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-light-mode-dark-mode.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959726" /><br/>
With Automatic turned on, the icons now turn dark when &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; is activated and light when &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; is off. This wasn't working in prior betas.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Stocks Icon</h2><br/>
Apple tweaked the design of the Stocks app icon. The lines are subtler, and there is no longer a white haze over the bottom part of the icon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/apple-stocks-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959730" /><br/>
<h2>iPhone Mirroring</h2><br/>
This is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> feature more than an &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; feature, but when using &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring with &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta 4, you can change the size of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; window on your Mac's display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iphone-mirroring-larger-smaller.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959721" /><br/>
<h2>Control Center</h2><br/>
There's a new Control Center toggle for Bluetooth, but it is not yet working. Apple also added a Silent Mode/Mute toggle and an Accessibility Eye Mirroring option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-control-center-bluetooth-toggle.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959731" /><br/>
The Open Music Control Center option has been removed.<br/>
<br/>
These changes are also applicable to the Lock Screen Controls.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AssistiveTouch</h2><br/>
There are new Type to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Apple Watch Mirroring options available for AssistiveTouch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/type-to-siri-accessibility-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959732" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
There are additional references to Apple Intelligence features, which suggests Apple is continuing to prepare to implement Apple Intelligence in the beta in the not too distant future.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-4/">fourth beta of macOS Sequoia</a> that came out today, Apple added a useful new feature to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring.<br/>

When you connect your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to your Mac, you can now make some changes to the window size, something that wasn't an option before. You can make the window bigger or smaller, changing the amount of screen space that it takes up on the Mac desktop.<br/>
<br/>
There are only three total sizes, including actual size, which is the size of your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display, smaller, and larger.<br/>
<br/>
The size options can be accessed by launching the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring app, connecting to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and then choosing your size from the View menu. There is no option to drag the window to resize, and you have to use the View options.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of upcoming an upcoming macOS 15 Sequoia update to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-3/">release of the third beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macOS-Sequoia-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955370" /><br/>
Registered developers can opt-in to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, which allows you to control your locked &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from your Mac. You can open and use &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps, interact with notifications, and drag and drop files between your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Mac and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
There are new options for window tiling, and dragging a window to the edge of the display will suggest a tiled location to make it easier to use multiple apps at once. Apple is adding a Passwords app for managing passwords, Safari can summarize websites and surface key information, and Notes has support for live audio transcription and math equations.<br/>
<br/>
All of the Apple Intelligence features coming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will also be available in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, but Apple does not plan to add these until later in the beta testing process. Apple Intelligence includes Writing Tools for editing, proofreading, and summarizing text in apps, and an Image Playground allows for AI images to be created from prompts.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth betas of upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-3/">release of the third betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;‌ Developer Beta setting. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, a set of AI features that are built deeply into the operating system. Apple Intelligence won't be coming until later in the beta testing process, but it includes features for refining and editing writing, generating images and emoji, and most notably, improving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and search. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is gaining a better understanding of natural language, improved contextual awareness, and the personal assistant will integrate with ChatGPT to answer more complex queries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads with an M-series chip, but there are a number of other features that are coming. Apple is allowing users to rearrange Home screen apps to have open spaces, plus there's a dark mode for app icons and tinting options.<br/>
<br/>
The Control Center is customizable and third-party developers can add controls for their apps, with the Lock Screen Flashlight and Camera icons able to be replaced or removed. Messages is gaining Rich Communication Services support to improve conversations with Android users, the option to schedule texts to be sent later, new text effects, messages over satellite when there's no cellular, and the option to use any emoji for Tapback responses.<br/>
<br/>
There's a dedicated Passwords app for logins, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes, and there's now an option to lock and hide apps, which means they can't be opened without secondary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication even when your phone is unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
Safari has a highlights feature that summarizes articles and surfaces key information on websites, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app interface has been overhauled, and there's a new Tap to Cash feature for privately and securely transferring money using Apple Cash. Other features include equation solving and voice memo transcription in Notes, a game mode for improving game performance, and an option to respond to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on AirPods with head gestures.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is only available to registered developers at the current time, but Apple plans to make a public beta later this month. &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; will see a public launch this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-4/">Apple Seeds Fourth Betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-betas-of-ios-18-and-ipados-18-to-developers.2432048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
We don't yet know what might be included in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.6, and no new features have been discovered in the betas so far. &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.6 is likely to see a release next week. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the fourth beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> update to developers, with the fourth beta coming two weeks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-3-to-developers/">after the third beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; is able to take the depth information from 2D photos and turn them into 3D photos using advanced machine learning. Apple says that the feature is meant to add depth to photos to make memories more immersive.<br/>
<br/>
There are new hand gestures for activating the Home View and Control Center, and the Home View is also now customizable with apps able to be rearranged. Travel Mode now includes support for trains, and Guest User profiles are now saved for 30 days so guests don't have to do the setup process every time they try out the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the year, Mac Virtual Display will support higher resolution and larger sized virtual displays, which Apple says will be equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. With an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> update, the Vision Pro can serve as an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; receiver, so content from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac can be shared to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Mindfulness app can track and respond to breathing patterns using the camera for an improved meditation experience, and the Vision Pro supports Bluetooth mice with &zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-4/">Apple Seeds Fourth visionOS 2 Beta to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-visionos-2-beta-to-developers.2432058/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Once beta updates have been activated, &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>

&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; introduces a new Vitals app that aggregates health metrics collected during sleep like heart rate and respiratory rate, providing day-to-day health insights to track whether something has changed. There's also a Training Load feature for monitoring the intensity of workouts and how that impacts the body over time.<br/>
<br/>
The Smart Stack has been updated with new widgets and support for Live Activities and Translate, plus it is better able to suggest widgets based on time and daily routine.

Activity Rings can be customized to change the goals for each day, and there is an option to pause for rest days or when ill without losing an activity streak.

tvOS 18 adds an InSight feature to the TV app, and it is able to provide real-time information about actors, music, and more in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> shows and music. Enhanced Dialogue has been refined with machine learning and computational audio so it is better able to boost vocal clarity over background noise and music, plus it is now available on built-in TV speakers, AirPods, and other Bluetooth devices.<br/>
<br/>
Subtitles will now show up automatically when relevant, such as when the TV's volume is muted, a show or movie is rewound, or when the language of a show doesn't match the device language.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include 21:9 aspect ratio support for projectors, new screen savers and improved controls for swapping screen savers, and support for Live Captions during <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls through an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>

The &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.<br/>
<br/>
Apple may make further improvements to Personas, EyeSight, and other features with &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.3, as well as implement additional bug fixes.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate version of an upcoming tvOS 17.6 to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/apple-seeds-tvos-17-6-beta-4-to-developers/">release of the fourth beta</a>. The RC marks the final version of tvOS 17.6 that will see a public release in the near future. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/apple-tv-4k-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.6 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software releases are usually minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.6.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-tvos-17-6-rc/">Apple Seeds tvOS 17.6 Release Candidate to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-tvos-17-6-release-candidate-to-developers.2432054/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 17 Rumored to Feature Mechanical Aperture for Portrait Mode</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to release at least one iPhone 17 model next year with mechanical aperture, according to a report published today <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone">by <em>The Information</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iPhone-17-Plus-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959520" /><br/>
The mechanical system would allow users to adjust the size of the iPhone 17's aperture, which refers to the opening of the camera lens through which light enters. All existing iPhone camera lenses have fixed apertures, but some Android smartphones have offered variable aperture over the years, such as Samsung's Galaxy S9 series.<br/>
<br/>
With a mechanical system, users could manually set a smaller aperture. This would allow photos to be shot with a shallow depth-of-field effect, where the subject stays in focus while the background is blurred. Apple already offers this effect on iPhones with Portrait Mode, but it is artificially generated, whereas this change would make it natural.<br/>
<br/>
Portrait Mode can occasionally have difficulties separating subjects in the foreground from the background, a problem that a mechanical aperture would solve.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release the iPhone 17 series in September 2025, and it is possible that mechanical aperture will be limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-5-major-features/">rumored high-end "iPhone 17 Ultra" model</a> (dubbed "iPhone 17 Slim" for now). With the devices still being over a year away, however, some of Apple's alleged camera-related plans could change.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/iphone-17-mechanical-aperture-rumor/">iPhone 17 Rumored to Feature Mechanical Aperture for Portrait Mode</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-rumored-to-feature-mechanical-aperture-for-portrait-mode.2432041/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a foldable iPhone that could be released as early as 2026, according to an exclusive report published today <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone?rc=583sff">by <em>The Information</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Galaxy-Z-Flip-Samsung.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959605" /><br/>
The report claims the device would feature a "clamshell" design, similar to Samsung's line of Galaxy Z Flip smartphones. Apple is said to have contacted suppliers in Asia in recent months about making components for the device.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors about a foldable iPhone have circulated for many years, but the report claims that Apple is finally moving forward with the project. The device has allegedly been given a codename of "V68" inside Apple, suggesting that work is ramping up.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to have struggled to achieve its goal of eliminating a visible crease in the area where the iPhone's screen would fold, but this obstacle could eventually be overcome. However, there is of course a possibility that Apple decides not to release a foldable iPhone, should the device fail to meet the company's high quality standards.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it appears that a foldable iPhone is still at least a few years away.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/foldable-iphone-2026-report/">Apple Reportedly Working on Foldable iPhone With Similar Design as Samsung&#039;s Galaxy Z Flip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-working-on-foldable-iphone-with-similar-design-as-samsungs-galaxy-z-flip.2432036/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last year, ESR was one of the first companies to launch a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/esr-halolock-geo-wallet-stand/">MagSafe wallet accessory</a> with full support for Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> network, using an on-board rechargeable module to tap into the network of hundreds of millions of Apple devices to help you keep tabs on your wallet. ESR has returned today with a <a href="https://waymeet-limited.kckb.me/774f288a">new crowdfunding campaign</a> for what it says is the first full-fledged wallet with integrated &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; support.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vfFjqmI_w8?si=_fzJmPwc5UD1ATa6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Available in seven color options, ESR's Geo Wallet is a traditional bifold wallet with a thin &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; module that allows you to keep track of your wallet's real-time location via the Items tab in Apple's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app. While some wallet makers have introduced wallets that allow you to attach an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> and other accessory companies have launched thin card-style &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; trackers, ESR appears to be the first to put the tracker right into the wallet itself, helping to reduce weight and bulk.<br/>
<br/>
ESR says the battery for the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; module in the Geo Wallet lasts up to five months, and with a magnetic charging cable the battery can be recharged in just two hours.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/esr-geo-wallet-specs-colors.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="705" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959583" /><br/>
With windowed slots for two ID cards, four additional slots for bank or membership cards, and a divided compartment for organizing your cash, the Geo Wallet also offer RFID-blocking technology to help keep your cards safe.<br/>
<br/>
The Geo Wallet is available in seven colors: carbon fiber, opal gray, elephant gray, twilight black, cocoa, aged leather, and tangerine. <br/>
<br/>
As with most crowdfunding campaigns, there are <a href="https://waymeet-limited.kckb.me/774f288a">multiple reward tiers available</a> with varying pricing. The &#36;38 Super Early Bird tier has already sold out, but there are still some slots left in the &#36;41 Early Bird tier, and if you miss out on those it jumps to &#36;44 at the Kickstarter Special tier. Multipacks are also available.<br/>
<br/>
As a Kickstarter campaign, the Geo Wallet is not available for immediate delivery, but ESR is aiming to start production in August and begin shipping in January, and the company has a track record of delivering on its campaigns.<br/>
