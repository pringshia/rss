		<description><![CDATA[Back in 2018, Google CEO Sundar Pichai asked Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> to ship iPhones with the Google Search app pre-installed, but Cook did not ultimately go for the idea. The information comes from the ongoing antitrust lawsuit that Google is facing from the U.S. Department of Justice, and it was shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938775/google-search-app-ios-built-in-antitrust"><em>The Verge</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837104" /><br/>
Pichai proposed the idea to Cook after Cook said that he wanted Apple to be "deep, deep partners" with Google. He told Cook that pre-installing the Google Search app would drive more traffic to Google, and therefore more money to Apple. Apple and Google have long had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/google-pays-apple-billions-default-search/">a search engine deal</a>, with Google paying &#36;18 to &#36;20 billion per year to be the default search engine on Apple devices, but in 2018, Apple's share of revenue was down.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, Pichai said that Cook should consider allowing Google to design an app or some other native <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> experience that would drive people to use Google search more often. "We said one of the things that works well on Android, which drives increased usage, is a Google Search application. So I proposed that we could build a Google search application for iOS... and we would be committed to supporting the product for many years," said Pichai.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple iPhones come with a number of Apple-created apps installed, Apple has never offered a pre-loaded third-party app, which is likely why the company did not accept Pichai's proposal.<br/>
<br/>
According to Pichai, he meets with Cook approximately once per year in order to discuss Google's search deal with Apple, which has been a major focus of the antitrust trial against Google. The U.S. Department of Justice believes that Google <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">has a search monopoly</a> that has turned it into the "gatekeeper of the internet," and the government is targeting some of the "exclusionary agreements" that Google has established with companies like Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple services chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/">testified in the trial in September</a>, and he said that Apple uses Google as the default option because the company has "always thought it was the best" and because there is no "valid alternative."<br/>
<br/>
Right now, Google is the default search engine option on all of Apple's devices. While the search engine can be changed on Apple products, many customers do not opt to choose one of the other options, which include Bing, Ecosia, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo. If the lawsuit determines that Google has engaged in antitrust activities, the deal between Apple and Google could be broken up, requiring Apple to provide additional search engine options during the Apple device setup process.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/google-search-iphone-pre-installed/">Google Wanted iPhones to Come Pre-Installed With Google Search App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-wanted-iphones-to-come-pre-installed-with-google-search-app.2409220/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<category>October 2023 Apple Event</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's "Scary Fast" virtual media event kicks off at 5:00 pm Pacific Time today, an unusual time for an Apple event that will see it occurring in the middle of the night for some users not traditionally accustomed to that timing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-october-scary-fast-event.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918335" /><br/>
We know that some <em>MacRumors</em> readers who can't follow the event as it's being broadcast are interested in avoiding all of the announcements and waiting until the event video is available for on-demand viewing so as to experience it without already knowing the outcome. <br/>
<br/>
For those individuals, we've posted this news story, which will be updated with a direct link to the presentation once it becomes available from Apple. No other news stories or announcements will be displayed alongside this story.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's recent virtual events have been made available to view almost immediately following the conclusion of the broadcasts, and we expect similar timing for today's event.<br/>
<br/>
Users waiting for the video to be posted are welcome to gather in the thread associated with this news story, and we ask that those who follow the events as they occur refrain from making any posts about Apple's announcements in this thread.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/october-2023-spoiler-free/">October 2023 Apple Event Spoiler-Free Video Stream</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/october-2023-apple-event-spoiler-free-video-stream.2409218/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has the Beats Studio Pro headphones for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C8PT7DF5%2Fref%3Dfs_a_bt2_us0%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;199.95</strong></a> in all four colors, down from &#36;349.99. Although this doesn't beat Prime Day's steeper &#36;179.00 price tag, this is still a solid &#36;150 markdown on the new headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/beats-studio-pro-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916586" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the Beats Studio Pro headphones at this price in Deep Brown, Black, Navy, and Sandstone on Amazon. The headphones come with improved sound quality, voice performance, comfort and durability, and connectivity compared to previous generation Beats.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C8PT7DF5%2Fref%3Dfs_a_bt2_us0%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;150 OFF</div>Beats Studio Pro for &#36;199.95</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few other Beats devices on sale as we head into November, starting with the Beats Studio Buds at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB096SSCV5K%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa"><strong>&#36;99.95</strong></a>, down from &#36;149.95. Amazon has five colors on sale at this price, which is another solid second-best price.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/beats-studio-buds-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916588" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB096SSCV5K%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Beats Studio Buds for &#36;99.95</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Lastly, the Beats Fit Pro are down to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JL65GNM%2Fref%3Dfs_a_bt2_us2%3Fth%3D1"><strong>&#36;159.99</strong></a> in six colors, down from &#36;199.95. These earbuds include the Apple H1 chip, making them easy to pair with iOS devices, and they're built for workouts with flexible wingtips.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp is planning to add passkey support to its iPhone app, according to code discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1718985018322653224">by software researcher @aaronp613</a> in the latest beta version of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
Passkey support would allow iPhone users to sign in to WhatsApp with Face ID, Touch ID, or the device's passcode. Passkeys are stored in iCloud Keychain. To use passkeys on the iPhone, the device must be updated to iOS 16 or later.<br/>
<br/>
"Passkeys are more secure than passwords, because they're uniquely generated for every account by your own device, and are less vulnerable to phishing," <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/iphone/iphf538ea8d0/ios">says</a> Apple. "And they work on all your devices that are signed in to the same Apple ID."<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear when WhatsApp plans to make this functionality available to the public, but it started rolling out passkey support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919609/whatsapp-passkey-android-update-passwordless-security">for Android</a> earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
Many apps are starting to implement passkey support, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/amazon-adds-support-for-passkeys/">including Amazon</a> last week.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/passkeys/">Passkeys</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/whatsapp-planning-passkey-support-on-iphone/">WhatsApp Working on Passkey Support on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-working-on-passkey-support-on-iphone.2409180/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case have returned to their all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;249.00. We haven't seen this deal since Prime Day earlier in the month, and right now the AirPods Pro 2 have an estimated arrival date between October 31 and November 4.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Warm-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895411" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
If you want a bit more of a discount, and don't need USB-C, Amazon has the AirPods Pro 2 with Lightning/MagSafe Charging Case for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. Stock on this model appears to be a bit strained, and we've seen the discount come and go frequently this morning. If you don't see it, be sure to check back later.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;199.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset. Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Capcom has released <em><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/resident-evil-village/id6450980545">Resident Evil Village</a></em> for iPhone 15 Pro models and iPads with M1 or later Apple silicon. The game is available now as a 7.92GB download from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/resident-evil-village/id6450980545">App Store</a>. Players can try it for free and unlock the full game for the special price of &#36;15.99 – a 60% discount that runs until November 20.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f5-Cj7KL0wo?si=zXzd1n8235yN-CFm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The regular pricing for the base game is &#36;39.99, with a &#36;19.99 in app purchase for the Winters’ Expansion DLC. There is also a &#36;4.99 All Access Voucher DLC. As noted by <em><a href="https://toucharcade.com/2023/10/30/resident-evil-village-iphone-15-pro-free-download-now-available-app-store-ipad-m1-launch-discount/">TouchArcade</a></em>, these DLC packs are the same as the PC and console versions.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> is due later this year for iPhone 15 Pro, iPad (M1 and later) models, and macOS. The App Store still <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082">lists the game</a> as "Coming Soon – Expected December 31, 2023," but this is a placeholder and the game could come much sooner (there is speculation it could even be released immediately following Apple's upcoming "Scary Fast" event.) <br/>
<br/>
<em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> were showcased during Apple's ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ announcement in September. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max are powered by an A17 Pro chip that features a brand new GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, enabling ported console games to be played on the iPhone at near-equivalent performance.<br/>
<br/>
DisplayPort support is built into the USB-C port on all iPhone 15 models, meaning that the devices can also output video at up to 4K/60Hz natively to a DisplayPort-equipped external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable. On previous iPhones with a Lightning port, video mirroring is limited to 1080p with Apple's Lightning-to-HDMI or Lightning-to-VGA adapters.<br/>

<em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> will have cross-progression on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. In contrast, <em>Resident Evil Village</em> has cross-progression on iPadOS and iOS only, because it is already available on macOS, while the iOS and iPadOS release is an individual purchase.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/capcom/">Capcom</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/resident-evil-village-available-iphone-15-pro-ipad/">Resident Evil Village Now Available on iPhone 15 Pro and M1/M2 iPads</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resident-evil-village-now-available-on-iphone-15-pro-and-m1-m2-ipads.2409157/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">"Scary Fast" event on Monday</a> at 5 p.m. Pacific Time, a regulatory database has potentially revealed at least some of the new products that will be announced, including new Macs and, dare we say it, maybe even a new iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Scary-Fast-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919318" /><br/>
Last week, two Apple suppliers resubmitted filings to a Chinese regulatory database for batteries used in existing Apple products, including the latest 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, Magic Keyboard for the Mac, and iPad mini, according to information discovered by <em>MacRumors</em>. All of the batteries had already been filed in the database in 2021 or earlier, and they were resubmitted last week with October 2023 issue dates.<br/>
<br/>
Resubmitted battery filings can hint at new products. Just ahead of the Apple Watch Series 9 being unveiled, for example, <em>MacRumors</em> discovered that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-battery-capacities/">Apple Watch Series 8 batteries were resubmitted</a> to the same regulatory database. Ultimately, the Series 8 batteries ended up being reused in the Series 9 models.<br/>
<br/>
The new filings list the same battery capacities as the original filings, suggesting that Apple's new products will not have any battery capacity changes. Longer battery life is still possible as a result of new chips with power efficiency improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects</a> the 24-inch iMac to be updated with the M3 chip, and the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad accessories for the Mac are expected to be updated with USB-C charging ports instead of Lightning. Apple includes the Magic Keyboard and the Magic Mouse in the box with the iMac. Gurman also expects updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
The interesting inclusion in the filings is a battery for the sixth-generation iPad mini, which could end up being reused in the seventh-generation iPad mini. Gurman last week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect">reported</a> that Apple was not planning to debut new iPads until 2024, and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo last month said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">new iPads were unlikely</a> to be released before the end of the year. The filing does not guarantee that a new iPad mini will be announced tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the sixth-generation iPad mini during its September 2021 event. The next model will likely be equipped with the A16 Bionic chip introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro, and it will likely have improvements to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">reduce so-called "jelly scrolling."</a><br/>
<br/>
Rumors about new iPads being announced earlier this month proved to be inaccurate. Instead, Apple announced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">lower-cost Apple Pencil</a> with a USB-C port in a press release. The new Apple Pencil will be available in early November, according to Apple, and new products announced at tomorrow's event could launch around the same time.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, our regulatory findings align with expectations of updated 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac models during Apple's event. Perhaps a new iPad mini will be part of the event, as well, but it would certainly be surprising given that Gurman and Kuo do not expect new iPads for the rest of the year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple won't update the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> until late 2024 and apart from fresh colors and USB-C charging, no other major changes are expected. That's according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-29/apple-to-unveil-m3-m3-pro-m3-max-chip-macbook-pro-imac-to-reignite-mac-sales-lobgrqad?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. <br/>
<br/>

Writing in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Gurman says Apple will replace the Lightning port for USB-C to comply with European regulations and for consistency across its AirPods lineup, but Apple does not plan to add the H2 chip and its attendant features like Adaptive Audio and Personalized Volume for the foreseeable future. <br/>
<br/>
Indeed, the next version of Apple's over-ear headphones will be so similar to the current models that Apple may not even change the generation number, similar to the USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
That said, Gurman adds that Apple's plans could "possibly" change between now and when the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are released.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/09/gurman-airpods-and-mac-accessories-usb-c-by-2024/">reported</a> that all three AirPods models and Mac accessories like the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad are likely to transition to USB-C by 2024.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/gurman-usb-c-airpods-max-late-2024/">Gurman: USB-C AirPods Max Not Coming Until &#039;Late 2024&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-usb-c-airpods-max-not-coming-until-late-2024.2409088/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is hosting an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">online streaming event</a> for the public and press on Monday, October 30, 2023 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. The company is expected to announce new Macs, and potentially other products during the event, dubbed "Scary Fast." Here's how you can watch it and when, depending where you are in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Event-October-2023.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919098" /><br/>
There are multiple ways to watch the October 30 event, with details listed below. We've also included a useful guide on when the event will take place in your particular time zone. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-october-2023-event/">What to Expect at Apple's "Scary Fast" Event</a></li></ul><br/>
Holding an event at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time is an unusually late time for Apple, and for most regions and territories east of London it will actually take place on the morning of Tuesday, October 31 -- or Halloween for many. So make sure you don't accidentally miss it because of the odd timing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Events Website</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events website</a>, you can watch the event live on a Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, PC, or any other device with a web browser. The Apple Events website works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and other main browsers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-events-website-october-30.jpg" alt="" width="1067" height="903" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918348" /><br/>
Just navigate to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">www.apple.com/apple-events/</a> using a web browser at the appropriate time to watch. You can visit the site now to add an event reminder to your calendar.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>YouTube</h2><br/>
Apple also plans to stream the event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=eN_kCGjo2wrffUee">live on YouTube</a>, which is perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to watch because the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=eN_kCGjo2wrffUee">YouTube live stream</a> can be viewed on every platform where YouTube is available, which is pretty much all platforms, from smartphones and tablets to consoles and smart TVs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=o4oqsu6j4sG-RroD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ctkW3V0Mh-k?si=eN_kCGjo2wrffUee">posted a placeholder for the October 30 event</a> on YouTube, and you can visit it now to set an event reminder.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV App</h2><br/>
Apple used to have a dedicated Apple Events app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, but ahead of WWDC 2020, it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/18/events-app-apple-tv-app-wwdc/">folded into the Apple TV app</a>. On event day, there will be a prominent &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app section dedicated to the live stream, which can be watched on any device where the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app is available.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/appleevents1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1112" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-746566" /><br/>
This includes the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, iPhones, iPads, and Macs, as well as select smart TVs, streaming devices, and gaming consoles. If you have an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app is one of the best ways to watch the event live. Apple hasn't updated the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app with the new event as of yet, but it should be added soon.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>When to Watch the Apple Event</h2><br/>
Unlike most Apple events, the company's "Scary Fast" event will take place at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Event times in other time zones are listed below.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has sent out Halloween-themed gift boxes to some influencers for them to enjoy while watching Apple's upcoming "Scary Fast" Mac-focused event on Monday night.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/gift-box-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919179" /><br/>
The gift boxes include a pair of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> headphones, an Apple cap, and a selection of "sweet and spooky" snacks and drinks. <br/>
<br/>
As shared by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lamarrwilson/video/7295111728801713454">influencer Lamarr Wilson</a>, the boxes also include an invite which reads:<br/>
<blockquote>It's almost Halloween and Apple has some treats in store for you.<br/>
<br/>
On the evening of October 30th, we'll unveil something special and invite you to join the online watch party.<br/>
<br/>
To make your viewing experience a bit more "spatial," we hope you'll enjoy immersive listening with AirPods Max, along with a few sweet and spooky snacks.</blockquote>Hints <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/alleged-macbook-pro-box-image/">suggest</a> the event will be all about the Mac, and the company is expected to refresh several Macs in the lineup with new high-performance (or "Scary Fast") M3 chips, including the 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>

That said, given the unusual late timing of the event at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, not to mention the confusion surrounding the Mac lineup right now, this is one of the more mysterious events Apple has promoted in recent years, so we could well be in for some surprises.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to stream the October 30 event <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">live on its website</a>, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctkW3V0Mh-k">YouTube</a>, and through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app. For those unable to watch, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage on MacRumors.com and the <a href="https://twitter.com/macrumorslive">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/apple-event-gift-boxes-sweet-and-spooky/">Apple Sends Out Gift Boxes With AirPods Max and &#039;Sweet and Spooky&#039; Snacks to Promote Mac Event</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sends-out-gift-boxes-with-airpods-max-and-sweet-and-spooky-snacks-to-promote-mac-event.2409069/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

This week also saw lots of news on the software front with the public release of iOS 17.1, macOS 14.1, watchOS 10.1, and other updates, plus the first betas of the next round of updates led by iOS 17.2 with a number of additions and changes. Apple's services were also in the news this week due to major price increases, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What to Expect at Apple's October 30 'Scary Fast' Event</h2><br/>
Surprise! Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">announced that it will be holding another event on Monday, October 30</a> at the unusual time of 5 p.m. Pacific Time. The event has a "Scary Fast" tagline, which is a reference to Halloween and likely also new Macs with faster Apple silicon chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/What-to-Expect-at-Apples-Scary-Fast-Event-Thumb-1-nopro.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919129" /><br/>
Apple has made it clear that the event will be focused on the Mac, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-scary-fast-event-livestream/">the event's page</a> features an animation depicting the Finder app icon from the Mac. As usual, we've put together a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-october-2023-event/">guide outlining what we're expecting to see</a> (plus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/what-not-to-expect-apple-october-event/">what we're not expecting to see</a>) at the event, with new iMac and MacBook Pro models headlining the list.<br/>
<br/>
The "Scary Fast" event will be streamed on Apple.com <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-scary-fast-event-livestream/">and on YouTube</a>, with no in-person component at Apple Park.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+ Get Significant Price Increases</h2><br/>
Apple this week announced that it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">increasing the prices of some of its subscription-based services</a>, including Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+, for new and existing subscribers in the U.S. and select other countries around the world.<br/>
<br/>

Notably, Apple TV+ now costs &#36;9.99 per month in the U.S., up from &#36;6.99 per month. For existing subscribers, this change will take effect in 30 days.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>New AirPods and AirPods Max Launching in 2024, Updated AirPods Pro Coming in 2025</h2><br/>
Apple plans to begin a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/airpods-lineup-overhaul-2024/">major overhaul of its AirPods lineup</a> starting next year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airpods-school.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905460" /><br/>
The standard AirPods will see two new models in late 2024 with and without Active Noise Cancelation, while AirPods Max updates in a similar timeframe will primarily be limited to new colors and a shift to USB-C. New AirPods Pro with updated designs for the earbuds and the case and improved audio quality should arrive in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pay Later Officially Launches in U.S. Following Early Access Period</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">upcoming "Scary Fast" event</a> takes place on October 30 (or 31, depending where you are) when it is expected to unveil new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, and a new 24-inch iMac. It may also make some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">additional new products available</a>, but there are a handful of rumored upcoming devices that we don't expect to make an appearance this month.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919162" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/scary-fast-what-not-to-expect.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
To help set expectations ahead of Apple's October event, we've compiled a list of products that Apple is unlikely to announce during "Scary Fast," but rather next year and beyond.<br/>
<h2 id="m3_13-inch_macbook_pro">M3 13-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Apple is developing new Macs powered by the company's next-generation M3 chip, which is built on chipmaking partner TSMC's 3nm process, resulting in significant performance and power efficiency improvements over the 5nm-based M2 chip that Apple's most recent Mac models are based on.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850662" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/13-inch-macbook-pro-2022-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1100" height="619" /><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman, Apple has M3-based versions of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models ready to go, but a new version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro featuring the M3 chip is looking increasingly less likely to appear alongside them at Apple's "Scary Fast" event.<br/>
<br/>
As recently as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/">last week</a>, Gurman said that supplies of the 13-inch MacBook Pro were running low, indicating that it could be replaced at the end of the month. But he now says that the new machine likely won't appear at Apple's upcoming event.<br/>
<br/>
"While the company has been working on a low-end MacBook Pro codenamed J504 with a base version of the M3 chip, that machine likely won't appear Monday," Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/m3-13-inch-macbook-pro-unlikely-to-be-at-event/">reported for <em>Bloomberg</em> on Friday</a>.<br/>
<h2 id="m3_13-inch_and_15-inch_macbook_air">M3 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Apple has not updated the smaller 13-inch MacBook Air so far this year. The current M2-powered model was originally announced in June 2022, so it was hoped that there would be a refresh soon. Indeed, in June 2023, Gurman claimed the 13-inch MacBook Air could be one of the first beneficiaries of Apple's new M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909564" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/13inch-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
However, more recently he has said that a 13-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip has only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/four-new-macbooks-on-schedule-for-launch-in-2024/">just reached engineering verification testing (EVT)</a>, an earlier production testing phase on prototype devices. Gurman says this puts the next-generation 13-inch MacBook Air on schedule for launch between the spring and summer of next year at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the 15-inch MacBook Air in June this year, and so it is not expected to be amongst the first generation of M3-powered Macs.<br/>
<h2 id="mac_pro_mac_studio_mac_mini">Mac Pro, Mac Studio, Mac Mini</h2><br/>
Likewise, Apple this year has already updated the Mac Pro and Mac Studio. These updates were also released in June 2023, so there is little chance that they will be superseded by newer models before 2024. Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/">maintains</a> that Apple will not refresh the MacBook Air models, Mac Studio, or Mac Pro at this time.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Mac mini, Apple updated the machine with M2 chips in January 2023, while M3-powered models are not expected to emerge until late 2024 at the earliest, according to Gurman.<br/>
<h2 id="new_ipads">New iPads</h2><br/>
Apple sometimes releases new iPads towards the end of the year, but there is increasing skepticism about that happening in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is widely believed to be working on new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">M3-powered iPad Pro models with OLED displays</a> and a redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory, but these devices are not expected to debut until the spring or early summer of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907943" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPad-mini-AND-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The same goes for the iPad mini, which was last updated in September 2021. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in January said the next model would likely enter mass production in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/new-ipad-mini-launching-next-year/">first quarter of 2024</a>. At the time, he also said there may be no new iPad releases in the following 9-12 months, and he has since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/no-new-macs-or-ipads-expected-rest-of-2023/">doubled down</a> on this prediction.<br/>
<br/>
According to Gurman, Apple is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/new-ipad-air-reportedly-in-development/">developing a new iPad Air</a> with improved specs, but he no longer believes it will arrive this year. Apple last updated the iPad Air in March 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869882" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Fanned-Pink.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Apple is also working on an 11th-generation entry-level iPad. The 10th-generation iPad was released in October 2022, and Apple has updated the entry-level iPad on an annual basis since 2017, but there are no rumors suggesting it will debut in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The Mac focus of Apple's "Scary Fast" event doesn't completely rule out new iPads from Apple this year, as Apple could conceivably choose to release new models in November via press release instead, like it did in January 2023 for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro and the second-generation HomePod. But neither <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/no-new-macs-or-ipads-expected-rest-of-2023/">Kuo</a> nor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/m3-13-inch-macbook-pro-unlikely-to-be-at-event/">Gurman</a> believe that any iPads are going to arrive before spring 2024 at the earliest.<br/>
<h2 id="iphone_se_4">iPhone SE 4</h2><br/>
Rumors regarding Apple's plans for the next-generation iPhone SE have been mixed at best, with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/13/iphone-se-4-rumors/">lot of back and forth</a> on when and indeed if we'll see a fourth-generation iPhone SE.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyoWyvk6esk?si=f2dppNeeAK-qsPOa" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/iphone-se-4-to-feature-action-button-and-more/">latest rumors suggest</a> the iPhone SE will be similar to the iPhone 14, featuring an all-display design with Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, a single rear camera, and an "Action" button to replace the mute switch. There's also a possibility that it could include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/suppliers-bidding-on-iphone-se-4-displays/">OLED display technology</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We are not expecting a new iPhone SE to debut this year or even next year, and it's looking like it will launch in 2025 at the earliest. It could perhaps be one of the first devices to feature an Apple-designed modem chip.<br/>
<h2 id="vision_pro_headset">Vision Pro Headset</h2><br/>
Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the so-called "spatial computing" device announced at WWDC 2023 in June.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
According to Apple, the Vision Pro will go on sale in early 2024, which likely means January to late April, with an outside chance of it arriving in May.<br/>
<h2 id="airpods_lineup">AirPods Lineup</h2><br/>
Apple is planning a major overhaul of its AirPods lineup, but that is not expected to start until next year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/airpods-lineup-overhaul-2024/">according to Gurman</a>. The standard AirPods and the AirPods Max will see a refresh in 2024, while the AirPods Pro will be updated in 2025. For the AirPods and AirPods Pro, Apple will update the design of the earbuds and the case, while also improving audio quality.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905460" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airpods-school.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
There is no clear word yet on when in 2024 and 2025 we might see AirPod refreshes, but Apple typically introduces new models in the latter half of the year around when new iPhones come out. Gurman says that the AirPods will come out "later next year" and the AirPods Max will come out "around the end of next year."<br/>
<h2 id="homepod_lineup">HomePod Lineup</h2><br/>
Lastly, HomePod. Apple's HomePod mini is now three years old. Gurman was first to highlight Apple's work on a second-generation HomePod mini in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/07/new-homepod-mini-and-high-end-homepod/">August 2022</a>. In February, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple will begin mass shipments of the second-generation HomePod mini in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/homepod-mini-2-shipping-next-year/">second half of 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904091" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/HomePod-Mini-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
It is also possible that Apple could wait to introduce a new HomePod mini until the debut of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/21/images-show-new-homepod-with-screen/">third-generation full-size HomePod</a>, especially if it includes new features. Apple is said to be developing an updated version of the HomePod that will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">feature a 7-inch display</a> and arrive in 2024, according to Ming-Chi Kuo. Gurman also believes Apple has a HomePod with a screen in development, but he does not expect it to come out until <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/homepod-with-screen-delayed-next-year/">next year at the earliest</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/what-not-to-expect-apple-october-event/">What Not to Expect at Apple&#039;s &#039;Scary Fast&#039; October 30 Event</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-not-to-expect-at-apples-scary-fast-october-30-event.2408994/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple earlier this week surprised us with an unexpected October event, and curiously, it is set to take place on Monday, October 30 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Apple has never hosted a nighttime event before, so Monday should be quite interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vvQEWR12rtU?si=ytzTKLh93Pghkw2m" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The "Scary Fast" event will be focused on the Mac, which has been confirmed by Apple's artwork for the event. On Apple's website, there is an Apple logo that morphs into the Mac Finder icon, so it's Macs that we're going to see.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors have been mixed about what we can expect at the event, but it's sounding like we'll get the entire M3 chip lineup. We've outlined what we've heard is coming, but we might also get some unexpected announcements.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="14-inch_and_16-inch_macbook_pro">14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models were updated with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips in January 2023, so it is early for an update, but it is not unheard of for Apple to refresh a Mac twice in a single year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/macbook-pro-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893124" /><br/>
Apple is expected to update the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with its next-generation M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, which will come less than a year after Apple debuted the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
The base M3 Pro chip will have a 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU, with upgrades available for a 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU. The base M3 Max chip will have a 16-core GPU and a 32-core GPU, with an option to upgrade to a 40-core GPU.<br/>
<br/>
Upgrading from &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro/&zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max to M3 Pro and M3 Max should bring notable performance improvements, especially when it comes to the GPU and the ability for the MacBook Pro to run high-end games.<br/>
<br/>
There was a recent rumor from <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> suggesting that the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will get more power-efficient miniLED displays, so there is a chance that we'll also see tweaks to display performance.<br/>
<br/>
If we get the M3 upgrade and a new miniLED display, the MacBook Pro models could have significant improvements to their battery life. Aside from the new chips and the possible new display, we are not expecting any other design changes for the MacBook Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="imac">iMac</h2><br/>
Apple hasn't refreshed the 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> since 2021, and it's still using the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is expected to get an update at Apple's event, and the new version will use the M3 chip, the same chip that will be in the 13-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-M3-Blue-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917291" /><br/>
Jumping from &zwnj;M1&zwnj; to M3 will improve both CPU and GPU performance, but most notably the GPU performance. The M3 chip supports more RAM, so we could see more maximum memory available with an update, as well as a higher-capacity SSD.<br/>
<br/>
There won't be notable design changes to the display of the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> believes that Apple will tweak the stand. Some of the internal components in the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; will be relocated and redesigned, with a new manufacturing process used to attach the stand.<br/>
<br/>
An upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E is likely, as is Bluetooth 5.3. These are technologies that have been introduced in other Macs over the last year. The M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is reportedly being tested in orange, blue, pink, and silver finishes, so we should see some of the same color options that were available with the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="usb-c_accessories">USB-C Accessories</h2><br/>
Apple is expected to eliminate the Lightning port in several of its Mac accessories, including the Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard. Instead of Lightning, these devices will adopt a USB-C port as part of Apple's transition to USB-C across its entire product lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/magic-mouse-2-lightning.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-835832" /><br/>
<h2 id="other_possibilities">Other Possibilities</h2><br/>
Aside from the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; and refreshed 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, there are no other rumors that suggest other devices are getting updated. <br/>
<br/>
Initial information indicated that the 13-inch MacBook Pro could see a refresh with an M3 chip, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/m3-13-inch-macbook-pro-unlikely-to-be-at-event/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> has since confirmed the 13-inch MacBook Pro will be refreshed at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
Other Macs, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> won't be updated until 2024, and the same goes for the iPads and AirPods. We are not expecting new iPads or new versions of the AirPods until next year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="how_to_watch">How to Watch</h2><br/>
Apple's "Scary Fast" event begins at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Monday, October 30.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to try out the software ahead of its release. The public iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 betas come a day after Apple released the betas for developers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918853" /><br/>
Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta.

<br/>
iOS 17.2 adds the Journal app designed to let <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users record their daily activities and thoughts. Apple offers prompts that can be used as inspiration, and journal entires can be outfitted with images, voice recordings, location tags, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Collaborative playlists are now available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> so you can create playlists that multiple people contribute to, and there's also now a Favorites playlist that has all the music you've favorited. Stickers can be used as tapback reactions in the Messages app, the Action Button on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models can now be set to a new Translate function, and Apple has implemented support for iMessage Contact Key Verification.<br/>
<br/>
There are new Weather and Clock widgets, tweaks to the TV app, updates to Message syncing across devices, new Memoji options, and more, with the full list of features we've found so far available in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">iOS 17.2 beta features article</a>.<br/>

Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.2 adds Messages sticker reactions, which make it quicker to add a sticker or an emoji to an iMessage. It also includes support for collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists, allowing multiple people to add songs to a single playlist. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy is joining the <a href="https://howl.me/ckSzIUk6sei">early Black Friday sale</a> club this weekend, offering My Best Buy Plus and Total members a chance to save on Apple products, video games, TVs, headphones, and much more. We're tracking another similar <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/sonos-early-black-friday-sale/">early Black Friday sale at Sonos</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/macbook-air-best-buy.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919064" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You'll need to be a My Best Buy Plus or My Best Buy Total member in order to see these deals. These memberships <a href="https://howl.me/ckSxsZbYnLm">start at &#36;49.99 per year</a>, and provide a few bonuses over the free version of My Best Buy. This includes free two-day shipping, exclusive access to sales like this weekend's early Black Friday event, extended 60-day return window on most products, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ckSzIhnEM7l"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;300 OFF</div>15-inch MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;999.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
In terms of Apple products, Best Buy's early Black Friday sale has a new all-time low price on the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air. You can get the 256GB model for &#36;999.00 and the 512GB model for &#36;1,199.00, thanks to an extra &#36;50 discount with your My Best Buy Plus or Total membership.

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qu3eAzqRywQ?si=EEp0ff4sM_vaiur9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
We talk through the unusual nature of the event, with Apple announcing it less than one week in advance, opting for an unorthodox 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time start, and even offering an explicit nod to the arrival of new Macs with a Finder easter egg. The event is expected to see the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/">debut of the M3 chip</a> and some of its more powerful variants. Two Mac models are currently in the running to be announced, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and high-end MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/">rumored to be on the table</a>. We also discuss our feelings about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> as we approach three years since their introduction and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 256GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max from Apple. For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">GRID Studio</a>, the company takes old, discarded Apple devices and turns them into clever artwork.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-1.jpg" alt="" width="1348" height="759" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919076" /><br/>
Each of GRID Studio's pieces features a deconstructed Apple device with the components laid out underneath a glass frame. There are labels for each part, along with interesting and relevant historical facts and details.<br/>
<br/>
One of GRID Studio's most popular offerings is the GRID 1, <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">priced at &#36;400</a>. The GRID 1 features the original Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> from 2007, highlighting the components that made up what has become the most popular smartphone in the world. The iconic original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; casing is positioned next to the power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components, and this is before the days where Apple started making its own chips.<br/>
<br/>
The GRID 4, <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/framed-iphone-4">available for just &#36;99</a>, is another great piece of Apple history. It highlights the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4, which is the first major redesign that Apple came out with. The GRID 4 includes the popular square-style frame that dictated several generations of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; design.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-iPhone4.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919077" /><br/>
GRID Studio's <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-5">&#36;139 GRID 5</a> shows off the internal components from the 2012 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 is notable because it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that was developed under Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, and the last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple CEO Steve Jobs was directly involved with. Compared to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4s, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 brought a taller 4-inch display and it was also the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to feature a Lightning port.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-iPhone-5.jpg" alt="" width="1816" height="1022" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919078" /><br/>
For Apple Watch fans, GRID Studio has the <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/apple-watch-series-0">&#36;199 GRID Watch 1st Gen</a>, which features the components from the first Apple Watch that Apple released in April 2015. Apple Watches today still use the same design that Apple introduced with the original model, though the display has grown and the bezels have been slimmed down. The original Apple Watch included the S1 chip, Apple's first system-on-a-chip, and the first Apple Watch heart rate sensor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-APPLE-WATCH.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919079" /><br/>
In addition to art pieces featuring torn-apart devices, GRID Studio also sells a range of fun t-shirts that are aimed at Apple fans. The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-command-t-shirt">&#36;39 GRID Command t-shirt</a>, for example, features the command key design recreated with a series of rainbow Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Command-Tshirt.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919081" /><br/>
Now is a good time to check out the <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/">GRID Studio website</a> because the company is hosting its autumn sale. From October 27 to October 29, the GRID 4 is available for &#36;99, while all Apple A-series mobile processor artwork is priced at &#36;79. All other items are available at a 15 percent discount with the promo code A15.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Beats brand is announcing a new collaboration today with EA SPORTS FC and star footballer Erling Haaland, which involves a new ad and multiple in-game Beats integrations for <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-24">EA SPORTS FC 24</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClORGJ4Ed7Q?si=KTf21t6uLJEXkX-n" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The new ad featuring Haaland was built using EA's Frostbite game engine to remix scenes of Haaland from the recent Beats ad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuUXiJW2HjY">"The King & The Viking"</a> featuring Haaland and NBA legend LeBron James.<br/>
<br/>
Under the new partnership, users who play EA SPORTS FC 24 by November 1 will receive Founder status in the game with access to exclusive in-game rewards such as a permanent Erling Haaland item in Ultimate Team mode and custom digital Beats Studio Pro in a Haaland-inspired Viking theme.<br/>
<br/>

And coming in December, FC 24 Player Career mode will add the ability for users to purchase additional virtual Beats headphones from their in-game salaries to earn Personality Points that enhance their on-field performance. As players advance through the mode, they'll be able to become Beats Ambassadors for additional salary and other benefits, while Manager Career mode will allow users to outfit their teams with Beats-inspired kits.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/beats-ea-sports-fc-collab/">Beats Teams Up With EA SPORTS FC for New Ad Campaign and Exclusive Game Benefits</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-teams-up-with-ea-sports-fc-for-new-ad-campaign-and-exclusive-game-benefits.2408890/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
