		<description><![CDATA[Following today's keynote event that saw Apple introducing the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, Apple allowed members of the media in attendance to spend some hands-on time with the new devices. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera was at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> for the event, so he's able to give us an early look at the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup, as well as his first thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ifzb4pwzRVM" title="Hands-On With Apple&#39;s New iPhone 15 &amp; iPhone 15 Pro Models!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models are made from titanium, and they are noticeably lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> models. There are contoured edges that improve the feel of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in the hand, and the Pro models are overall much more comfortable to hold. Apple also cut down on bezel size for even more display than ever, and the Action Button that replaces the Mute Switch is super convenient.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added a 5x zoom lens to the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max and at its 120mm focal length, you can get great portrait shots. There are options on both Pro models to change the focal length of the Main camera, which you can do just by tapping. It can be set to 24mm, 28mm, or 35mm, and the ability to change focal length is useful for pro photographers. <br/>
<br/>
As for the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, they're more Pro-like than ever with the addition of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and the new matte glass back. Apple say it is using back glass that has color infused throughout the material, and it's a nice look, especially with the pastel color options.<br/>
<br/>

Additional new features on iOS 17 include Contact Posters, NameDrop, Live Voicemail, Check In, the ability to download Apple Maps for offline use, and much more, with a full overview of the update available in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17 roundup</a>.<br/>

Thread networking technology is listed as a new feature for the Pro models, but it is not included in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-gray.jpg" alt="" width="1876" height="1055" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910519" /><br/>
Apple says that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; is the first smartphone with a Thread radio, which can be used to directly control Thread-enabled smart home products. Thread has previously been added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, but no other Apple devices have Thread connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
In the press release for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, Apple explains that Thread opens up "future opportunities for Home app integrations."<br/>
<br/>
Thread is a mesh smart home network system that improves the connectivity and responsiveness of connected products. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-thread-support/">Apple Adds Thread Networking Technology to iPhone 15 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-thread-networking-technology-to-iphone-15-pro.2401316/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are the first iPhones to support next-generation Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, with the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models continuing to be limited to Wi-Fi 6.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-iphone-15-white-titanium.jpg" alt="" width="2084" height="1172" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910514" /><br/>
With Wi-Fi 6E support, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max can connect to the 6GHz band offered by Wi-Fi 6E routers for faster speeds, improved latency, and less interference from other devices.<br/>
<br/>
Connecting to Wi-Fi 6E does require a Wi-Fi 6E router, but there are multiple options on the market now. There are still a limited number of devices that have Wi-Fi 6E support, so for now, the 6GHz band has a lot less congestion.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been adding Wi-Fi 6E support to its devices since 2022. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213433">It is available</a> in the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> machines.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-models-wi-fi-6e/">iPhone 15 Pro Models Support Wi-Fi 6E</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-models-support-wi-fi-6e.2401312/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At today's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> event, Apple introduced an add-on feature to Emergency SOS via Satellite called Roadside Assistance via Satellite. The feature is similar to Emergency SOS, but it allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to contact roadside assistance if they have car trouble in an area without cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-roadside-assistance.jpg" alt="" width="1596" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910510" /><br/>
Roadside Assistance via Satellite is available for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, but it is also a feature that is retroactively available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> lineup. Available in the United States, roadside assistance is being offered through a partnership with AAA.<br/>
<br/>
The functionality is included in an AAA membership, but Apple said that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users can also get access separately. The company did not provide details on what it would cost without an AAA membership, but AAA is priced starting at &#36;65 per year.<br/>
<br/>
As with Emergency SOS via Satellite, you can text roadside assistance and choose what you need help with. Options demonstrated at the event included flat tire, no fuel, locked out, vehicle stuck, and vehicle does not start.<br/>
<br/>
Apple includes two years of Emergency SOS via Satellite and Roadside Assistance via Satellite connectivity for free with the purchase of an &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. Note that in the case of Roadside Assistance, you need the satellite connectivity and to pay the additional fee to AAA.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emergency-sos-via-satellite/">Emergency SOS via Satellite</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14">iPhone 14 (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14-Pro">iPhone 14 Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/roadside-assistance-via-satellite/">Apple Announces New Roadside Assistance via Satellite Feature for iPhone 14 and iPhone 15</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-new-roadside-assistance-via-satellite-feature-for-iphone-14-and-iphone-15.2401306/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max features a new Telephoto lens that uses a tetraprism design to enable 5x optical zoom, an improvement over the 3x zoom that's available in the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and the prior-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and Pro Max models. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-camera.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910485" /><br/>
5x optical zoom allows for 25x digital zoom, and while that's the most zoom an Apple device has offered, it still falls below the competition. <br/>
<br/>
Samsung's latest Galaxy S23 Ultra smartphone has 100x Space Zoom that can capture images from 330 feet away. The Pixel 7 Pro has 30x digital "Super Res Zoom" with its 5x optical zoom lens.  Apple has never leaned into digital zoom because the quality is poor. Optical zoom provides a crisp, clear image using the camera hardware, but digital zoom uses software enhancement to crop in. <br/>
<br/>
5x optical zoom is an &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max-specific feature that is not available on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. Both devices share other camera improvements, though. The 48-megapixel main camera has a larger sensor that lets in more light, and it can be set to 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths. <br/>
<br/>
There's also an updated 13mm Ultra Wide camera, and second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/">iPhone 15 Pro Max&#039;s 5x Optical Zoom Lens Enables 25x Digital Zoom</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-maxs-5x-optical-zoom-lens-enables-25x-digital-zoom.2401302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max models all remain equipped with a physical SIM card tray outside of the United States, as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/iphone-15-esim-only-france-rumor/">rumored eSIM-only expansion</a> with the devices failed to materialize.<br/>
<br/>

Tech specs <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/iphone-15-pro/specs/">on Apple's website</a> confirm that all four iPhone 15 models remain compatible with nano-SIM cards in countries such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, Singapore, Turkey, and everywhere else they are sold. In most countries, the devices also continue to support eSIM as well, allowing for dual-SIM functionality with cellular networks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/07/iphone-14-models-no-sim-card-tray-us/">removed the SIM card tray from all iPhone 14 models</a> in the U.S. last year, forcing customers to use an eSIM, a digital SIM that allows users to activate a cellular plan without having to use a physical nano-SIM card. Apple has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209096">support document</a> with a list of carriers that support eSIM technology around the world.<br/>
<br/>
When the iPhone 14 series launched in the U.S., <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/14/apple-promotes-esim-benefits-for-iphone/">Apple promoted eSIMs</a> as being more secure than a physical SIM since they cannot be removed from an iPhone that is lost or stolen. Apple added that up to eight eSIMs can be managed in the iPhone's Settings app, eliminating the need to obtain, carry, and swap physical SIM cards while traveling. iPhone 13 and newer models can have two eSIMs active at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
With eSIM availability expanding, the SIM card tray might eventually be removed from iPhones sold outside of the U.S., but for now it lives another year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-still-has-sim-card-tray-outside-us/">iPhone 15 Models Sold Outside U.S. Still Have Physical SIM Card Tray</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-models-sold-outside-u-s-still-have-physical-sim-card-tray.2401299/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 15 Models Still Limited to 7.5W on Qi Chargers, Fast Charging Has Not Improved</title>

		<description><![CDATA[When the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models were introduced today, Apple's Kaiann Drance mentioned that they support the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/03/qi2-wireless-charging-standard-gains-magsafe/">next-generation Qi2 charging standard</a>, but that apparently does not mean that Qi charging will be faster.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/magsafe-charger-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-868313" /><br/>
Apple's technical specifications page for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models says that Qi-based charging is still limited to 7.5W, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charging is 15W.<br/>
<br/>
Qi2 is a new wireless charging standard built on &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging technology supplied by Apple. It includes a Magnetic Power Profile that ensures that smartphones are "perfectly aligned with charging devices" and it is meant to offer "improved energy efficiency and faster charging."<br/>
<br/>
Some companies have announced Qi2 chargers that can charge at up to 15W, the same as &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, but it does not appear that Apple's iPhones will support the faster 15W Qi2 charging functionality.<br/>
<br/>
There have been no improvements to &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging speeds either, and rumors that suggested we could see quicker wired charging may also be incorrect. <em>9to5Mac</em> said that the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models could support faster charging speeds using a 35W charger, but Apple's technical specifications page doesn't list any improvement to fast charging.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models will continue to charge to 50 percent in around 30 minutes with a 20W or higher adapter. It is possible that using a 35W or higher charger will speed up charging, but that will need to be figured out once the devices are released.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-qi-charging-no-improvement/">iPhone 15 Models Still Limited to 7.5W on Qi Chargers, Fast Charging Has Not Improved</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-models-still-limited-to-7-5w-on-qi-chargers-fast-charging-has-not-improved.2401281/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Charger immediately following its iPhone 15 event. Both accessories are no longer available to order on Apple's online store, with the product listings completely removed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/magsafe-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896744" /><br/>
Both the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Charger were equipped with a Lightning port, so it is not too surprising that they were discontinued after Apple introduced four new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-and-15-plus/">iPhone 15 models with USB-C ports</a>. Last year, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had predicted that the MagSafe Battery Pack <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/">would transition to USB-C</a> eventually, but it's unclear if that will ever happen or if the accessory has been retired for good.<br/>
<br/>
Released in 2021, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ was priced at &#36;99 and attaches magnetically to the back of the iPhone 12 and newer, providing hours of additional battery life. Meanwhile, the MagSafe Duo was a &#36;129 foldable charging mat with both a MagSafe charger for iPhones and an Apple Watch magnetic charging puck.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did release some other new USB-C accessories, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/">updated AirPods Pro and EarPods</a>, while the Apple TV's Siri Remote <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/apple-tv-remote-usb-c-port/">gained a USB-C port last year</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe Battery Pack</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">Apple Discontinues MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Charger</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-magsafe-duo-charger.2401280/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 15 Models Do Not Come With Rumored Color-Matched Braided USB-C Cables</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">rumors from leakers</a> like Majin Bu and Kosutami suggested that the new iPhones would be sold with color-matched braided USB-C to USB-C cables, but that didn't happen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-charging-cable.jpg" alt="" width="1689" height="950" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910432" /><em><div class="center-wrap">The cable that comes with the new &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;</div></em><br/>
Apple did update the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; with a USB-C port, but they are sold with standard, plain white braided USB-C to USB-C cables.<br/>
<br/>
Images of the supposed "color-matched" cables were in the soft pastel colors that the iPhones were rumored to come in, but looking back, the colors were slightly off. Leaks also suggested that the cables could be 50 percent longer at 1.5m in length, but that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-braided-usb-c-cable-could-be-longer/">was also incorrect</a>.<br/>
<br/>

All of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are sold with a USB-C to USB-C cable that is one meter in length, but the cables are indeed braided for additional durability. Apple is selling no braided USB-C to USB-C cables in colors that match the iPhones, though there is a 1-meter black Thunderbolt 4 cable that enables USB 3.1 transfer speeds of up to 10Gb/s on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-no-color-matched-cables/">iPhone 15 Models Do Not Come With Rumored Color-Matched Braided USB-C Cables</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-models-do-not-come-with-rumored-color-matched-braided-usb-c-cables.2401276/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following today's "Wonderlust" Apple event, singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo released the first music video shot on Apple's all-new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. The video is for Rodrigo's song "get him back!", from her sophomore album "GUTS," which released last week.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max feature an improved camera system, including a main camera with a larger sensor, a new coating to reduce lens flare, and better low light performance for Portraits and Night mode. The main camera allows users to switch between three focal lengths (24mm, 28mm, and 35mm) and choose one as a new default.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; features a 3x Telephoto camera, while the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max has the longest optical zoom ever seen on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>: 5x at 120mm. Apple said that thanks to optical image stabilization, an autofocus 3D sensor-shift module, and a tetraprism design, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max camera is the company's most advanced stabilization system yet.<br/>
<br/>
The new camera also has an updated Smart HDR system that will capture subjects and backgrounds with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows. All of these upgrades come from Apple's new A17 Pro chip.<br/>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
As listed on Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/">specifications page</a>, all versions of the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj; 2 feature twice as much storage as their predecessors. The increase offers substantially more space for apps and media, and is presumably related to the all-new S9 chip, which brings significant performance and efficiency improvements to the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
The original Apple Watch, Series 2, and Series 3, had just 8GB of storage, increasing to 16GB on the Apple Watch Series 4. The Apple Watch Series 5 increased storage once more to 32GB, where it has remained through the Series 6, Series 7, and Series 8, making the Series 9 the first time the Apple has increased the device's storage in five years. <br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that only a proportion of the Apple Watch's storage is available for media like music and podcasts, since Apple caps it at 25% of the device's total storage pool. This means recent models have been unable to store more than 8GB of media. With the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj; 2, users will be able to store 16GB of media.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, there were rumors that said both devices would see a price increase. It was speculated that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; could start at &#36;1,099 and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max could start at &#36;1,199, which, as it turns out, isn't quite right. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910410" /><br/>
Apple did not change the price of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, and it is still priced starting at &#36;999 for 128GB of storage. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is priced starting at &#36;1,199, but that's only because Apple has eliminated the 128GB storage tier for that device. It now starts at 256GB, and &#36;1,199 is the same price Apple charged for the 256GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> Max.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is charging &#36;1,399 for the 512GB &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max and &#36;1,599 for the 1TB &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, so the pricing is the same as the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; Max for all storage capacities. <br/>
<br/>
The standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus models have not changed in price. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;799 and the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus is priced starting at &#36;899.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-pricing/">Pricing on iPhone 15 Pro Models Technically Didn&#039;t Change</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pricing-on-iphone-15-pro-models-technically-didnt-change.2401264/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the new standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with a USB-C port, data transfer over a cable remains limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps, which is equal to the Lightning port on previous iPhones. Apple confirmed this detail in its tech specs for the devices posted on the company's website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
The higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also equipped with a USB-C port, but those devices support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps over a cable. Unlike recent iPad Pro models, this means that the Pro models unfortunately do not support Thunderbolt, which theoretically supports speeds up to 40 Gbps.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 Pro models will require a supported cable, such as Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-usb-c-lightning-adapter-and-more/">one-meter Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable</a>, to achieve USB 3 data transfer speeds.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models are available to pre-order this Friday and launch September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-usb-port-limited-to-lightning-speeds/">iPhone 15&#039;s USB-C Port Remains Limited to Lightning Speeds</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15s-usb-c-port-remains-limited-to-lightning-speeds.2401261/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced new 6TB and 12TB storage tiers for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>+ subscription service, pushing past 2TB for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/icloud-plus-storage-tiers.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910389" /><br/>
Every <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> receives 5GB of free cloud storage, but users can upgrade to a paid &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ storage subscription plan to get 50GB, 200GB, 2TB, 6TB, or 12TB of storage. All paid &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ storage plans include features like &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay, Hide My Email, and Custom Email Domains. Currently, subscribers pay &#36;0.99 per month for 50GB of cloud storage, &#36;2.99 per month for 200GB, and &#36;9.99 per month for 2 TB.<br/>
<br/>
The new 6TB &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ will be priced at &#36;29.99 per month and while the 12TB plan costs &#36;59.99 per month. For comparison, Google's 5TB and 10TB cloud storage plans cost &#36;24.99 and &#36;49.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
The higher storage tiers provide an option for those who had already filled 2TB of storage from &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ and 2TB of storage from an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> subscription. Like other &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ subscription plans, the pool of cloud storage can be shared among up to six people via Family Sharing. The bigger &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; plans are set to become available on Monday, September 18.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-drive/">iCloud Drive</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-adds-6tb-and-12tb-icloud-tiers/">Apple Adds 6TB and 12TB iCloud+ Storage Tiers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-6tb-and-12tb-icloud-storage-tiers.2401256/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, Apple is using a new titanium frame rather than a stainless steel frame, which cuts down on weight. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; Max. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/f-4d62f49966d4af93a651379f09657fba6cc3c770.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910268" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; weighs 187 grams, down from 206 grams for the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max weighs 221 grams, down from 240 grams for the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; Max. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus continue to feature a chassis made from aluminum, so there has been no notable weight change with those devices compared to the prior-generation.<br/>
<br/>
Along with lowering the weight of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, the titanium material is also less prone to fingerprints because of the new brushed finish and it is more durable. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/titanium-iphone-15-pro-weight/">Titanium iPhone 15 Pro Weighs 19 Grams Less Than iPhone 14 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/titanium-iphone-15-pro-weighs-19-grams-less-than-iphone-14-pro.2401254/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Here's a rundown of its functions.<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-lineup-Action-button-230912.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910375" /><br/>
The all-new Action button replaces the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent, offering additional options so users can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight, activate Voice Memos, Focus modes, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier. Users can also associate it with Shortcuts for more options. <br/>
<br/>
A press-and-hold gesture with fine-tuned haptic feedback and visual cues in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> ensure the new Action button launches the intended action, which users can customize in Settings and assign to different actions. Here's what it can be programmed to do:<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Access to various accessibility settings, such as VoiceOver, Zoom, AssistiveTouch, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Shortcuts</strong>: Run a shortcut created in or downloaded from the Shortcuts app, such as sending a message, playing a playlist, or controlling smart home devices.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Silent Mode</strong>: Like the Ring/Silent switch on existing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, toggle silent mode on or off, which will mute or unmute the ringer and alerts.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Camera</strong>: Launch the Camera app and/or take a photo or video with a single press of the Action button.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Flashlight</strong>: Turn on or off the flashlight on the back of the device.<br/>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Activate or deactivate a Focus mode.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Magnifier</strong>: Activate the Magnifier app to use the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s camera as a magnifying glass to zoom in on small text or objects.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Translate</strong>: Launch the Translate app and start a conversation or text translation with a single press of the Action button.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Voice Memos</strong>: Start or stop recording a voice memo with the Voice Memos app.</li></ul><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-and-15-plus/">standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models</a> retain the traditional Ring/Silent switch, making the "Action" button one of the key differentiating features of the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, and also something that makes the new models‌ stand out from their predecessors.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/action-button/">Action Button</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-action-button-everything-it-can-do/">iPhone 15 Pro: Here&#039;s Everything the New Action Button Can Do</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-heres-everything-the-new-action-button-can-do.2401252/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
