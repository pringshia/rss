		<description><![CDATA[In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10117/">WWDC 2024 coding video</a> last week, Apple highlighted a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Translation">recently-introduced API</a> that allows developers to offer built-in Translate app capabilities in their own apps on iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS Sonoma, and later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-17-4-Translate-App-API.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956475" /><br/>
While the iPhone, iPad, and Mac already offer a system-level translation function for highlighted text, websites viewed in Safari, and more, the API provides a convenient solution for user-generated content like reviews. For example, if a user writes a review in Japanese, the text can be quickly translated to other languages.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia enhance the API by allowing translated text to appear in-line within an app, instead of in an overlaid Translate sheet.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Translate-App-API.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956474" /><br/>
Another language-related change on iOS 18 is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10185/">bilingual keyboard support</a>. For example, you can type in English and Korean on the same keyboard without having to manually switch languages, complete with word suggestions in each language.<br/>
<br/>

iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia are currently in beta for developers. The software updates will be released later this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-translate/">Apple Translate</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-translation-framework/">iPhone Apps Can Integrate With Translate App on iOS 17.4 and Later</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-apps-can-integrate-with-translate-app-on-ios-17-4-and-later.2429688/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming macOS 14.6 update to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its launch. Today's public beta comes a few days after Apple released the initial developer beta. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Apple today seeded the third beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.5 update to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its launch. The public beta comes a week after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/apple-releases-second-public-beta-of-ios-17-5/">released the second public beta</a> and a day after Apple seeded the beta to developers. <br/>
<br/>
Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
No new Mac features were found in the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.6 developer beta, so it is not clear what might be included. With Apple now working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, development on &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; is beginning to wrap up.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-releases-first-macos-sonoma-14-6-public-beta/">Apple Releases First macOS Sonoma 14.6 Public Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-first-macos-sonoma-14-6-public-beta.2429685/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 updates to public beta testers, with the betas coming a few days after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-seeds-ios-17-6-beta-1-to-developers/">initial iOS and iPadOS 17.6 developer betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-17.6-Feature-Redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950716" /><br/>
Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
The new additions Apple promised for &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; have all been implemented at this point, so it is not clear what will be included in iOS 17.6, and no features were discovered in the developer beta.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple now shifting its focus to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, it is likely that iOS 17.6 will include bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also seeded the first public betas of upcoming watchOS 10.6 and tvOS 17.6 updates. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-releases-first-public-beta-of-ios-17-6/">Apple Releases First Public Beta of iOS 17.6</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-first-public-beta-of-ios-17-6.2429684/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/new-versions-of-final-cut-pro-for-ipad-and-mac-available-today/">today released</a> Final Cut Pro 2 for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Final Cut Pro 10.8 for the Mac, two Final Cut Pro updates that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/final-cut-pro-ipad-2/">first announced back in May</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949711" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/final-cut-pro-ipad.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" /><br/>
Final Cut Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has been updated with new capabilities that are designed for the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models that came out earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
Live Multicam lets users capture up to four different angles of a single scene using connected iPhones and iPads. To make this feature work, Apple has created a Final Cut Camera app that captures video from each of the devices and feeds it into Final Cut Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Users can get a director's view of each connected camera in real time, and the settings can be adjusted from the Final Cut Pro app. There are options for tweaking exposure, focus, white balance, ISO, shutter speed, and zoom to get the perfect shots. Preview clips are passed through to Final Cut Pro and then replaced with full-resolution files so users can quickly move from production to editing.<br/>
<br/>
Final Cut Camera is available as a standalone app as of today and in addition to feeding footage to Final Cut Pro, it can be used as a video capture app for recording video with precise manual controls.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949712" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/final-cut-camera.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" /><br/>
The updated Final Cut Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app supports external projects, so users can create or open projects on an external device and import media without taking up &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; storage space. Apple added additional customization options to Final Cut Pro, including 12 color-grading presets, eight basic text titles, 20 soundtracks, and new dynamic backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
With the M4 chip, final rendering with Final Cut Pro is up to 2x faster, and it supports up to 4x more streams of ProRes RAW than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. Final Cut for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, adding support for barrel roll and squeeze, improving access to and control over tools.<br/>
<br/>
As for Final Cut Pro for the Mac, it includes Enhance Light and Color, an AI feature that improves color, color balance, contrast, and brightness in one step. Smooth Slo-Mo, another new feature, blends frames of video intelligently to provide higher-quality movement.<br/>
<br/>
Final Cut Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 2 is available as a free update for existing users, with new users able to purchase it for &#36;4.99 per month or &#36;49 per year. Final Cut Pro for Mac 10.8 is also available as a free update for existing users, with new users able to purchase the software for &#36;299.99. Apple has also released new versions of Compressor and Motion.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/final-cut-pro/">Final Cut Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/final-cut-pro-major-update/">Final Cut Pro Gets Major Update With New Camera App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/final-cut-pro-gets-major-update-with-new-camera-app.2429683/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a collection of Bluetooth tracker discounts on Amazon, which include low prices on Apple's AirTag and Eufy's SmartTrack Card accessory. There are also a few Anker discounts on Amazon this week, including portable batteries and charging stations.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iPadOS 18, which will be widely released later this year, iPad apps can offer custom drawing tools for the Apple Pencil.<br/>
<br/>

For example, in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10214/">WWDC 2024 coding video</a> last week, Apple demonstrated how an app could implement a tool that allows for cat paw prints and other animal-related symbols to be added to a drawing. The custom tools support features on the new Apple Pencil Pro, including the squeeze gesture and barrel roll action.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 and visionOS 2 also support custom drawing tools in apps, but the iPhone and Vision Pro do not support the Apple Pencil. As always, any drawing tool can also be controlled with your finger and other input methods.<br/>
<br/>

In addition to custom tools, apps across iPadOS 18, iOS 18, and visionOS 2 are able to change the selection of default drawing tools that appear in the system tool picker. Apple said apps are even able to offer multiple tools of the same type for added convenience, such as two colors of pens or two colors of markers.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 18, iOS 18, and visionOS 2 are currently in beta.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/ipados-18-custom-apple-pencil-drawing-tools/">iPadOS 18 Allows Apps to Offer Custom Drawing Tools for Apple Pencil</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-18-allows-apps-to-offer-custom-drawing-tools-for-apple-pencil.2429675/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new Beats Solo Buds wireless earbuds are available to purchase at select Apple retail stores and authorized resellers around the world starting today. <br/>
<br/>

Beats Solo Buds feature a more affordable &#36;79.99 price in the U.S., up to 18 hours of battery life, and a compact USB-C carrying case. However, they lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery. As a result, the earbuds can only be charged when the case is connected to an external power source.<br/>
<br/>
Beats Solo Buds pre-orders <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/beats-solo-buds-orders/">began on Tuesday</a>, ahead of today's launch. The earbuds can be <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUW03LL/A/beats-solo-buds-true-wireless-earbuds-transparent-red">purchased on Apple's online store</a> for delivery, or in-store pickup where available.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-the-exchange-trx-opens-saturday-june-22-in-kuala-lumpur/">previewed</a> its first store in Malaysia, Apple The Exchange TRX, located in Kuala Lumpur's Tun Razak Exchange business district.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-trx-exterior.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956347" /><br/>
The architectural design of Apple The Exchange TRX features a three-dimensional layered roof with horizontal glass panels and sun-shading blades. A central glazed oculus brings natural daylight into the interior and contains a dynamic artificial-lighting system that adjusts based on the time of day. The building connects the mall's central atrium to a rooftop park that wraps around the store's upper level.<br/>
<br/>
Inside, a sculptural quartz and glass staircase connects the three levels. The main floor is a floating deck that sits above the primary display area. The Forum, where Today at Apple sessions take place, is located on this floating deck, providing a central location for workshops and events. The upper level, which connects directly to the rooftop park, brings natural light and greenery into the store through a continuous glass facade. The interior features high-quality materials such as natural stone walls, polished stainless-steel columns, light terrazzo floors, and a timber ceiling.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-trx-interior.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956348" /><br/>
Apple The Exchange TRX runs on 100% renewable energy and is carbon neutral, in line with Apple's broader environmental goals. The store contains a Genius Bar, a dedicated Apple Pickup counter, and more than 160 retail employees to help customers.<br/>
<br/>
To celebrate the store's opening, Apple will run a special series of Today at Apple sessions called "Jom Discover," running from June 22 through July 6. These sessions will feature some of Malaysia's most celebrated creators, offering insights into their creative processes and showcasing Apple's products and services. Highlights include a performance by De Fam, workshops on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> photography with Jason smashpop, video editing on Mac with Adam Lobo, productivity on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with Iman Azman, and health and wellness sessions with Nana Mohd focusing on the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple The Exchange TRX opens on Saturday, June 22, at 10 a.m. MYT.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/">Retail</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/malaysia/">Malaysia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-unveils-stunning-kuala-lumpur-store/">Apple Unveils Stunning Kuala Lumpur Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-unveils-stunning-kuala-lumpur-store.2429668/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is introducing a notable enhancement to its virtualization framework in macOS Sequoia by enabling Mac users to sign into iCloud within macOS virtual machines (VMs).  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-hero-240610.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954631" /><br/>
Previously, users could not sign into iCloud on macOS VMs, which limited the framework's utility for developers needing to test iCloud features and for users looking to sync their apps with iCloud. As spotted by <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-quietly-improves-mac-virtualization-in-macos-15-sequoia/">ArsTechnica</a></em>, macOS Sequoia removes that barrier, provided that both the host and guest operating systems are macOS 15 or newer.<br/>
<br/>
The feature will be available on Apple silicon Macs, but it has some limitations. Developers aiming to run older macOS versions alongside macOS 15 in a VM or those who upgrade VMs from older macOS versions will not be able to sign into iCloud on the VM. Only brand-new VMs created from a macOS 15 install image (an .ipsw file) can utilize iCloud and services related to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/apple-id-renamed-to-apple-account/">Apple Account</a> (formerly Apple ID).<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/using_icloud_with_macos_virtual_machines">virtualization framework documentation explains</a>: <br/>
<blockquote>"When you create a VM in macOS 15 from a macOS 15 software image… Virtualization configures an identity for the VM that it derives from security information in the host's Secure Enclave. Just as individual physical devices have distinct identities based on their Secure Enclaves, this identity is distinct from other VMs."</blockquote>Apple says that if someone moves a VM to a different Mac host and restarts it, the Virtualization framework automatically creates a new identity for the VM using the information from the Secure Enclave of the new Mac host. This identity change requires the person using the VM to re-authenticate to allow iCloud to restart syncing data to the VM.<br/>
<br/>
Both Parallels and VMware offer virtualization software, and Broadcom recently made VMware Fusion <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/vmware-fusion-pro-13-free-personal-use/">free for personal use</a>. macOS Sequoia is currently in developer beta, with a public beta set to arrive in July, followed by a general release in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/macos-sequoia-adds-icloud-support-vms/">macOS Sequoia Adds iCloud Support for macOS 15 Virtual Machines</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-adds-icloud-support-for-macos-15-virtual-machines.2429664/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17, Apple doesn't offer a system-level method for individually locking sensitive apps like Photos behind Face ID. There is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/automatically-lock-iphone-app-opened/">Shortcut action</a> that provides rudimentary protection, but it's not infallible. Thankfully, iOS 18 includes a dedicated option to lock and even hide individual apps even when the iPhone itself is already unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" /><br/>
This is useful because it means you can unlock your iPhone and hand it to someone for them to look at something, knowing they won't be able to open the apps you have locked. If someone using your iPhone tries to open an app that you have manually locked using the method described below, they will see a popup informing them that it can't be accessed without secondary authentication via Face ID (or Touch ID on the iPhone SE). <br/>
<br/>
Notably, if <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-stolen-device-protection/">Stolen Device Protection</a> is active, entering a passcode to unlock an app is not an option, so even if your iPhone is stolen and the thief knows your passcode, they still won't be able to open the app. However, if Stolen Device Protection is not enabled, a passcode prompt appears that can be used to unlock the app after three failed Face ID attempts.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that not all apps can be locked. As things stand in the first iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 betas, Apple does not provide the lock option for non-sensitive apps like Maps, Clock, Calculator, and Stocks. Otherwise, almost every other app can be locked, including third-party apps. Here's how it's done.<br/>
<ol><li>On your Home Screen, press and hold on the icon for the app that you want to lock.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Require Face ID</strong> (or Touch ID).</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Require Face ID</strong> (or Touch ID) to confirm.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/lock-app-ios-18.jpg" alt="safari" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956294" /><br/>
<br/>
Note that you can't use Siri with a locked app, and Spotlight search and any notification previews will not show content from the app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Lock and Hide Apps</h2><br/>
When you lock a third-party app using the above method, you have the option to hide it as well – but at present you cannot hide system apps like Safari or Photos. When enabled, the app icon and name is removed from the Home Screen, and it will not show up in searches, although it may still appear in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/hide-app-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956295" /><br/>
An obscured folder for hidden apps is also created in your App Library, which is accessed by swiping left to the end of your Home Screen pages. However, you will not get app notifications or incoming calls from a hidden third-party app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Unlock and Unhide Apps</h2><br/>
To unlock an app that you previously locked, simply long press on the app's icon and choose the "Don't Require Face ID" option. As long as you have Stolen Device Protection enabled, turning the lock on and off requires a ‌Face ID‌ scan, so it can't be turned off without your knowledge. <br/>
<br/>

To unhide a locked third-party app, swipe through to the App Library and tap the obscured Hidden folder at the bottom. You will be required to perform a Face ID scan to reveal its contents.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store">online education store</a> has gone down in the United States and Canada, as Apple prepares to launch its annual Back to School promotion for university students.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/apple-store-down.jpg" alt="" width="1142" height="654" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-852939" /><br/>
Apple's back to school sales provide students with a free Apple gift card when purchasing a Mac or an iPad, and this year's promotion could help Apple push the new M2 iPad Air and M4 iPad Pro models. <br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple offered U.S. students up to &#36;150 when purchasing a Mac and up to &#36;100 when purchasing an ‌iPad‌. <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1803484272873099699">According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple will this year again offer up to a &#36;150 gift card with every Mac purchase, and it will additionally shave 20% off the price of AppleCare+. Gift cards will also again be offered with iPad purchases, but Gurman did not state an exact value.<br/>
<br/>
Apple began advertising its Back to School sale on social networks in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/back-to-school-2024-launching-this-week/">early June</a>, with some Instagram users seeing an ad promoting Macs with discounts to college and university students.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/education/">Education</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-education-store-down-us-canada/">Apple Education Store Down in US and Canada, Back to School Offer Expected Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-education-store-down-in-us-and-canada-back-to-school-offer-expected-soon.2429653/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Pencil Pro has dropped to a new record low price today on Amazon, and we're also tracking a collection of discounts on the M4 iPad Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pencil Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-pencil-pro-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956283" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
Amazon today has the Apple Pencil Pro for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;119.00</strong></a>, down from the regular price of &#36;129.00. Although this is only a &#36;10 discount, it's now the lowest price we've tracked on the brand new Apple Pencil Pro among the major online retailers. The Apple Pencil 2 is also at an all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.00</strong></a> right now on Amazon.<br/>

The Apple Pencil Pro launched last month alongside the new 2024 iPad lineup, introducing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/apple-pencil-pro-features/">new gestures and capabilities</a> into the stylus. The Apple Pencil Pro is compatible with the M4 iPad Pro and the M2 iPad Air, and marks the first update to the Apple Pencil since the Apple Pencil 2 in 2018.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in iOS 17 added a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-check-in-feature-ios-messages/">Check In feature to Messages</a> that allows you to let a loved one know when you've made it back home safely. With watchOS 11, Check In is also coming to Apple Watch, but it's not just in the Messages app that you can activate it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/check-in-workout-watchos-11.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956266" /><br/>
Anyone who has used a Garmin watch will probably be familiar with its LiveTrack feature, which creates a real-time view of your location during an activity, so friends and family can keep tabs on your progress. Strava Beacon offers similar functionality, and now with Check In integration, Apple Watch users can let loved ones know they have successfully completed their workout, too.<br/>
<br/>
Like on iPhone, Apple Watch users can start a Check In from Messages in watchOS 11. But the feature also works within the Workout app. When you start a workout, a swipe right reveals a new Check In option. So if you're walking home after dark or heading out for an early morning run, you can notify someone that you've started out, and Check In will let them know when you return home.<br/>
<br/>
If something unexpected happens and you get delayed, Check In will automatically notify your friend that you haven’t arrived as expected, and tell them your location (if available), the route you took, and your iPhone's battery level and cellular service in case they want to contact you.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a new option in Settings ➝ Workout that lets you turn on Check In Reminders, so Apple Watch can remind you to send a Workout Check In whenever you start an outdoor workout.<br/>
<br/>
Note that watchOS 11 is in developer beta, and some features could always change or be removed before Apple releases the new Apple Watch software to the public in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/watchos-11-supports-workout-check-in/">watchOS 11 Gets &#039;Check In&#039; Feature That Supports Outdoor Workouts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-gets-check-in-feature-that-supports-outdoor-workouts.2429597/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models running iOS 17.2 or later <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/record-spatial-video-iphone/">can record spatial video</a> with 3D depth for playback on Apple's Vision Pro headset. While spatial video recording has been limited to Apple's built-in Camera app until this point, third-party camera apps on the App Store can also offer this functionality starting on iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-iphone-15-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911686" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10166/">WWDC 2024 coding session</a> last week, Apple revealed that it has released an API that allows developers to offer spatial video recording in any app. Apple said the API is built into existing camera-related frameworks, making it easy to implement.<br/>
<br/>
When held in landscape orientation, the iPhone 15 Pro's main and ultra wide cameras combine to record spatial video. In addition to the iPhone 16 Pro models, it is likely that spatial video recording will be expanded to the regular iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, as the rear cameras on those devices are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">rumored to be vertically aligned</a>.<br/>
<br/>
You will need a Vision Pro to see the added depth in spatial videos, as they appear in a normal 2D format when played on an iPhone.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, Apple is introducing a new personalized AI experience called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence</a> that uses on-device, generative large-language models to enhance the user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-Apple-Intelligence-hero-240610.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954530" /><br/>
These new AI features require Apple's latest iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models to work, while only Macs and iPads with M1 or later chips will support Apple Intelligence. Since the news came to light, many users have been asking what the reason is for the cut-off.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2024/">The Talk Show Live From WWDC 2024</a>, <em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber put the question to Apple's AI/machine learning head John Giannandrea, marketing chief Greg Joswiak, and software engineering chief Craig Federighi, and this was the response.<br/>
<blockquote>Giannandrea: "So these models, when you run them at run times, it's called inference, and the inference of large language models is incredibly computationally expensive. And so it's a combination of bandwidth in the device, it's the size of the Apple Neural Engine, it's the oomph in the device to actually do these models fast enough to be useful. You could, in theory, run these models on a very old device, but it would be so slow that it would not be useful.<br/>
<br/>
Gruber: "So it's not a scheme to sell new iPhones?"<br/>
<br/>
Joswiak: "No, not at all. Otherwise, we would have been smart enough just to do our most recent iPads and Macs, too, wouldn't we?"</blockquote>Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi said that the company's first move with any new feature is to work out how to bring it back to older devices as far as possible. But when it comes to Apple Intelligence, "This is the hardware that it takes... It's a pretty extraordinary thing to run models of this power on an iPhone," he added.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro models use the A17 Pro chip, which has a 16-core Neural Engine that's up to 2x faster than the A16 chip found in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, performing nearly 35 trillion operations per second. Federighi hinted that RAM is also another aspect of the system that the new AI features require, so it is perhaps no coincidence that all the devices compatible with Apple Intelligence have at least 8GB of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the cutoff, owners of older iPhones still have plenty to look forward to in Apple's upcoming software update: iOS 18 boasts several new features besides Apple Intelligence, and every iPhone that can run iOS 17 is compatible iOS 18. That includes the iPhone XR from 2018.<br/>
<br/>
If you still want Apple Intelligence in your pocket but don't have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, you may want to hold out for the iPhone 16 series, which is expected to launch when iOS 18 is released in the fall. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/daringfireball-net/">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/apple-iphone-15-pro-requirement-apple-intelligence/">Apple Explains iPhone 15 Pro Requirement for Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-iphone-15-pro-requirement-for-apple-intelligence.2429589/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<h2>Two-Finger Drag to Select Items</h2><br/>
If have apps where you habitually tap on each individual item in a list to select them – emails in your Mail inbox, for example – it's time to dial in some efficiency and embrace this faster method.<br/>
<br/>
This gestural feature allows you to easily select (or deselect) multiple items in apps like Contacts, Mail, Messages, Voice Memos, Notes, and indeed any Apple app that lists multiple items. Here's how it works. <br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open an app where multiple item selection is supported.</li><br/>
  <li>Touch and hold the screen with two fingers at the same time.</li><br/>
  <li>While keeping both fingers on the screen, drag them down (or up) to select multiple items. As you drag, items will be highlighted to indicate they are selected.</li><br/>
  <li>Once the desired items are selected, you can perform actions such as moving, deleting, or organizing them.</li><br/>

<br/>
That's all there is to it. This simple yet powerful feature streamlines your workflow, saving you time and effort when handling multiple items.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is facing a "number" of "very serious" issues with its Digital Markets Act compliance in Europe, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/apple-issues-very-serious-under-landmark-eu-rules-vestager.html">CNBC</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple in March to determine if Apple's EU app marketplace changes were complying with DMA regulations. The DMA requires Apple to provide developers with an option to distribute apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and without &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;'s fees. Apple implemented <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/apple-releases-ios-17-4/">support for app marketplaces</a> with iOS 17.4, but it charges an 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee for each download after the initial 1 million annual installs.<br/>
<br/>
Vestager does not believe that Apple's changes meet the requirements of the DMA. "We have a number of Apple issues; I find them very serious," she said. "I was very surprised that we would have such suspicions of Apple being non-compliant."<br/>
<br/>
She went on to say that this implementation "is not what was expected of such a company" and that the DMA rules will be enforced "exactly with the same top priority as with any other business."<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission plans to reveal the conclusions of its probe "hopefully soon," and if Apple is found to be violating the terms of the DMA, the European Union could levy significant fines up to five percent of its average daily worldwide revenue (upwards of &#36;1 billion).<br/>
<br/>
Last week, <em>Financial Times</em> said that the European Commission is planning to charge Apple for violating the Digital Markets Act. The EC believes that Apple is not complying with its obligation to allow developers to "steer" users outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; without fees.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does still have time to make changes to iOS before charges are announced by regulators, and the EC is expected to make an announcement in the "coming weeks."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-dma-issues-eu-rule-enforcement-soon/">Apple Has &#039;Very Serious&#039; DMA Issues, EU to Enforce Rules &#039;Soon&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-has-very-serious-dma-issues-eu-to-enforce-rules-soon.2429560/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Logitech today announced the launch of the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/tablet-keyboards/keys-to-go2-universal.html">Keys-To-Go 2</a>, a new portable wireless keyboard that's designed for tablets and mobile devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and it works as a lightweight alternative for those who do not want to invest in Apple's Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/logitech-keys-to-go.jpg" alt="" width="1390" height="782" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956153" /><br/>
The keyboard is designed to work as a standalone device, so it does not attach to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and you will need to pair it with a stand or smart cover for a Mac-like experience. Available in lilac, pale gray, graphite colors, the Keys-To-Go 2 is just under 10 inches long, four inches wide, and it weighs 7.84 ounces.<br/>
<br/>
There is a built-in cover that protects the keyboard during travel, keeping it safe from scratches and spills. It is equipped with scissor keys that have 1mm of travel for a comfortable typing experience, and there is an option to connect to up to three devices and swap between them quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Logitech designed the keyboard with two layouts, including a Universal layout and a dedicated Apple layout for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The top key row features several shortcut keys for adjusting volume, media playback, and screen brightness levels, as well as locking the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwwVUIILwJM" title="Powerfully Portable Tablet Keyboard | Introducing Keys-To-Go 2" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The keyboard pairs to an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; using Bluetooth, and there are replaceable coin cell batteries that Logitech says will last up to three years depending on usage.<br/>
<br/>
The Keys-To-Go 2 keyboard is priced at &#36;80 and it can be <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/tablet-keyboards/keys-to-go2-universal.920-012867.html">purchased from the Logitech website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/logitech/">Logitech</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/logitech-keys-to-go-2/">Logitech Launches &#039;Keys-To-Go 2&#039; Portable Keyboard for Tablets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/logitech-launches-keys-to-go-2-portable-keyboard-for-tablets.2429555/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today debuted <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/best-mac/">a new Mac website</a> that's designed to help potential customers find the ideal Mac. The "Help Me Choose" site asks users a few questions and then suggests the Mac that will best meet the user's needs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-help-me-choose-website.jpg" alt="" width="2040" height="1148" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956147" /><br/>
Questions include what the Mac will be used for, necessary day-to-day essentials, info on the user's creative pursuits, the need for portability, which peripherals will be used, and budget.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's algorithm for suggesting a Mac takes all of these factors into account, and it doesn't just present buyers with base configurations. It suggests upgrades to memory and storage that would be useful, and it will also present options if your selected budget is a little flexible.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/best-mac/">Help Me Choose website</a> can be found under the Mac section of Apple's website when selecting the "Compare" option or the "Shop Mac" and then "Shopping Guides" option.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-help-me-choose-mac-website/">Apple Launches &#039;Help Me Choose&#039; Website for Finding the Right Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-help-me-choose-website-for-finding-the-right-mac.2429549/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
