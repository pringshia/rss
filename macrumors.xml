		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models will be the first to feature more than one 48-megapixel sensor, leaving the Telephoto camera as the only rear-facing lens with a 12-megapixel resolution, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> reports. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/12/iphone-11-pro-ultra-wide.jpg" alt="" width="2264" height="1186" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-722975" /><br/>
Writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/玉晶光為高階鏡頭升級週期再起的關鍵贏家-iphone-17前相機升級-iphone-16-pro潛望鏡與超廣角-vision-pro-與華為p70超廣角-genius-is-a-key-7f125f60d783">Medium</a>, Kuo explained that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s Ultra Wide camera will feature a 48-megapixel sensor. The upgrade should allow the camera to capture more light, resulting in enhanced photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models already have a 48-megapixel Main camera that uses "pixel binning" to merge data from four pixels on the sensor into one "super pixel" for improved low-light capture. With the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models, this technology is expected to expand to the Ultra Wide lens, which is currently a 12-megapixel lens.<br/>
<br/>
This also means that &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models should be able to shoot <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-14-pro-take-48-megapixel-proraw-photos/">48-megapixel ProRAW photos</a> in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, International Securities analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">claimed</a> that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; will feature a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera. Just a few months later, further details about Apple's plan for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/iphone-16-pro-rumored-to-feature-48mp-ultra-wide/">Ultra Wide camera upgrade</a> emerged on Chinese social media site Weibo. With Kuo now throwing his weight behind the rumor, the upgrade seems highly likely.<br/>
<br/>
In 2025, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 Pro is expected to complete the rear camera array's transition to 48-megapixel sensors, bringing the technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/">to the Telephoto lens</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo added that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is on-track to feature the tetraprism Telephoto camera introduced on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. Kuo also said that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 lineup will feature an upgraded front-camera camera unit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">with a 24-megapixel sensor</a> and a six-element lens.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/iphone-16-pros-ultra-wide-camera-major-upgrade/">iPhone 16 Pro&#039;s Ultra Wide Camera Rumored to Receive Major Upgrade</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pros-ultra-wide-camera-rumored-to-receive-major-upgrade.2415420/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Could Acquire Peloton This Year, Fund Manager Forecast Suggests</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will likely acquire fitness company Peloton this year, according to a new hedge fund manager forecast.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/peloton-tv-workout-cardio.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-776133" /><br/>
Deepwater Asset Management's <a href="https://deepwatermgmt.com/deepwaters-2024-predictions/">annual forecast</a> for 2024 (via <em><a href="https://connectthewatts.com/2024/01/03/deepwater-predicts-apple-acquisition-of-peloton/">Connect the Watts</a></em>) claims that Apple is likely to acquire Peloton sometime in 2024. The move would help Apple bolster its Fitness+ subscription service, adding equipment to compliment the Apple Watch and its existing activity tracking software. Absorbing Peloton's three-million subscriber-base would ostensibly add about &#36;1.7 billion to Apple's subscription revenue and line up with its continued investment in health and wellness, the company claims.<br/>
<br/>
In 2022, Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/21/apple-floated-as-potential-buyer-of-peloton/">repeatedly floated</a> as a potential buyer of Peloton amid <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/07/peloton-now-in-trouble-thanks-to-apple-fitness/">financial difficulties and threats to its business model</a>, but the company's prospects have since improved somewhat and Deepwater Asset Management's new forecast is the first serious mention of the possibility in some time. Major questions remain about why Apple would want to take responsibility for Peloton's fragile business model and not simply focus on growing Fitness+, but anything is possible.<br/>
<br/>
Deepwater Asset Management also believes that Apple will bring generative AI to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> this year, integrating its Ajax foundation model to a new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that is likely to be introduced at WWDC. The change should increase &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s perzonalisation and natural conversation abilities. The hedge fund manager is also not expecting Apple to announce any additional Vision Pro products this year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peloton/">Peloton</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fitness-plus/">Apple Fitness Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-could-acquire-peloton-this-year/">Apple Could Acquire Peloton This Year, Fund Manager Forecast Suggests</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-could-acquire-peloton-this-year-fund-manager-forecast-suggests.2415419/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, according to Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/dynamic-island.jpeg" alt="" width="1244" height="706" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-889703" /><br/>
The information was shared in a new <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/玉晶光為高階鏡頭升級週期再起的關鍵贏家-iphone-17前相機升級-iphone-16-pro潛望鏡與超廣角-vision-pro-與華為p70超廣角-genius-is-a-key-7f125f60d783">post on Medium</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. With the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17, Apple will apparently bolster the hardware to a 24-megapixel camera with a six-element lens. Kuo says that the upgrade will significantly improve the image quality of the front-facing camera.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 6S</strong>: 5-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture and 4P lens</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 7, iPhone X, and iPhone XS</strong>: 7-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture and 4P lens</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 11, iPhone 12, and iPhone 13</strong>: 12-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture and 5P lens</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16</strong>: 12-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/1.9 aperture, autofocus, and 5P lens</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 17</strong>: 24-megapixel front-facing camera with autofocus and 6P lens</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels is noteworthy because it would allow for greater detail and clarity in images. With a higher resolution, photos can maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, providing more flexibility in post-processing. Additionally, the larger number of pixels can capture finer details, making the images sharper and more vibrant.<br/>
<br/>
The upgrade to a six-element lens would also slightly enhance image quality. Each element can be designed to correct for various aberrations and distortions, leading to clearer, more accurate photos. The additional elements can also improve the efficiency of light transmission to the sensor, enhancing low-light performance.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">expected</a> to be the first ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ to feature under-panel <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> technology, which could reduce the size of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, but a circular cutout for the front-facing camera is expected to remain. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro will probably be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple is then <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-under-display-camera/">expected</a> adopt under-display cameras in 2027's "Pro" ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ models for a true "all-screen" appearance.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">Kuo: iPhone 17 to Feature 24MP Front-Facing Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera.2415409/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Hulu is a perk that joins the existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> and Netflix subscriptions that T-Mobile Go5G Next users have access to.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile says that free Netflix, Hulu, &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj;, and MLB.TV add up to more than &#36;35 per month or &#36;400 per year in benefits.<br/>
<br/>
The Hulu plan that T-Mobile customers are able to access is valued at &#36;7.99 per month, and it does include ads during shows and movies. Hulu says that ads typically play at the beginning of the stream and throughout the video, similar to a traditional TV broadcast.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Three hours after releasing the second betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, Apple has pulled the updates from the Developer Center and over the air, meaning they are no longer available to download and install.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.3-Buggy-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928685" /><br/>
Apple has removed the iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas after a number of people reported that the software is bricking devices. According to reports on <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-2-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2415339/">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonButch/status/1742628347002204350">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_inside/111693591558795389">Mastodon</a>, some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners who updated found their devices stuck in a boot loop.<br/>
<br/>
The only fix to the issue appears to be restoring a stuck device, which is why Apple has pulled the update. Once the bug is addressed, Apple will re-release the beta.<br/>
<br/>
There are reports that suggest the iOS 17.3 boot loop bug <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_inside/111693804775894724">could be related</a> to the Back Tap setting. A log shared by developer Guilherme Rambo indicates that a Back Tap setting caused his device to crash, and there have been several other affected users who have Back Tap enabled in some capacity.<br/>
<br/>
Some others who had Back Tap enabled were able to install the update, and others who did not have the feature on had the booting issue, so it is not entirely clear how Back Tap is involved.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-pulls-ios-17-3-beta-2/">Apple Pulls iOS 17.3 Beta 2 Due to Boot Loop Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pulls-ios-17-3-beta-2-due-to-boot-loop-issue.2415355/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

After a user toggled off the setting, the bug could cause it to turn back on, resulting in any songs that a user added to a playlist being added to their music library in an unwanted manner.<br/>
<br/>

Fortunately, it appears that Apple quickly addressed the bug with a server-side fix, and users are no longer impacted by this issue. Given it was a server-side fix, users do not need to update their devices to a newer software version for it to apply.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Restoring to the prior version of iOS 17.3 or the iOS 17.2.1 release software appears to address the problem, but users who do not have a backup may have issues with the restore process.<br/>
<br/>
Not all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users appear to be affected, as some iPhones updated to iOS 17.3 beta 2 have come through fine.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet commented on the bug, but it is likely the second iOS 17.3 beta will be pulled in the near future until the issue can be addressed.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/ios-17-3-beta-2-bricking-some-iphones/">Warning: iOS 17.3 Beta 2 Bricking Some iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/warning-ios-17-3-beta-2-bricking-some-iphones.2415350/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is discounting an array of Apple Watches today, including the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Although none are at all-time low prices, these are the best discounts we've tracked since the Black Friday shopping season.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-and-Ultra-2-Deals-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913210" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Series 9</h2><br/>
Starting with the Apple Watch Series 9, Amazon has the 41mm GPS device for &#36;349.00 in three Aluminum colors, down from &#36;399.00. The 45mm GPS device is on sale for &#36;379.00 in every Aluminum color, down from &#36;429.00.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 9 is Apple's newest mainline wearable device. It shares the same look as the previous generation model, but includes a faster S9 chip, brighter display, and new features like Double Tap.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5R8BP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm GPS) for &#36;349.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXF9R4Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm GPS) for &#36;379.00</div></a></div><h2>Apple Watch SE</h2><br/>
Amazon has the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE for &#36;199.00, down from &#36;249.00, and the 44mm GPS Apple Watch SE for &#36;229.00, down from &#36;279.00. Both models are available in three Aluminum colors: Midnight, Silver, and Starlight.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch SE is Apple's low-cost option in the Apple Watch lineup, and it'll get the job done for most people who want a simple fitness tracker. It lacks the Series 9's health sensors like ECG, blood oxygen, and temperature sensing.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXCXKPD%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch SE (40mm GPS) for &#36;199.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5W8YM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch SE (44mm GPS) for &#36;229.00</div></a></div><h2>Apple Watch Ultra 2</h2><br/>
Finally, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 has dropped to &#36;749.00 on Amazon, down from &#36;799.00. This one is available in a large collection of colors and band styles, and it's just about &#36;10 away from the all-time low price.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is Apple's most rugged wearable, and compared to the previous generation it has an improved GPS, more durable display, extra long battery life, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7C4CL%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;749.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second betas of upcoming iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the updates available three weeks after the release of the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-releases-ios-17-2-and-ipados-17-2/">iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3 introduces a Stolen Device Protection feature that limits access to your private information in case someone obtains both your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and your passcode. When activated, it requires <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> identity verification to do things like accessing passwords in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain, turning off Lost Mode, making purchases through Safari with saved payment credentials, and more.<br/>
<br/>
There are also features that require verification <em>and</em> have a one-hour delay to access, such as changing an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; passcode, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; passcode, turning off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and turning off &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;. More details can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">found in our article on Stolen Device Protection</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>, a feature that lets <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> subscribers share playlists with others to build shared song lists. Collaborative playlists are simple to use, can be shared with a link, and support emoji reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release iOS 17.3 later in January.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-betas-of-ios-17-3-and-ipados-17-3-to-developers.2415337/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.3 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While the majority of Apple's product lineup has been updated over the past few years, there are a handful of devices and accessories that are quite old. Below, we highlight seven of the oldest and most obscure products that Apple still sells in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-and-Often-Forgotten-Products-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928623" /><br/>
Many of these products are unlikely to be updated ever again, and it's unclear how long Apple will continue to sell them on its online store.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>SuperDrive</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-SuperDrives.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928630" /><br/>
Introduced alongside the original MacBook Air in 2008, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive">USB SuperDrive</a> is an external CD/DVD drive. It remains available on Apple's online store for &#36;79, but you'll need a USB-A to USB-C adapter to use it with a modern MacBook.<br/>
<br/>
The last MacBook with a built-in CD/DVD drive was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/27/apple-discontinues-non-retina-macbook-pro/">discontinued in 2016</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MagSafe Converter</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-MagSafe-Adapters.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928628" /><br/>
For just &#36;9.99, you can own Apple's tiny <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD504LL/A/magsafe-to-magsafe-2-converter">MagSafe to MagSafe 2 converter</a>. This adapter allows Apple's very-old Thunderbolt Display to charge an also-very-old MacBook Pro or MacBook Air equipped with a MagSafe 2 connector.<br/>
<br/>
For those counting, Apple moved on to MagSafe 3 in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>EarPods With 3.5mm Plug</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-EarPods-With-3.5mm-Plugs.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928624" /><br/>
Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone starting with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus back in 2016, but it continues to sell wired <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-35mm-headphone-plug">EarPods with a 3.5mm headphone plug</a> for &#36;19. You can also get EarPods <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/earpods-usb-c-lightning-or-headphone-plug/">with Lightning or USB-C</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Macs still have a headphone jack.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>30-Pin to USB Cable</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-30-Pin-Connectors.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928622" /><br/>
Still rocking out with an older iPod or iPhone? Apple has you covered with its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA591G/C/apple-30-pin-to-usb-cable">30-pin to USB cable</a>, featuring breakthrough USB 2.0 technology from the early 2000s.<br/>
<br/>
Pro tip: you can get one for much cheaper on Amazon if you really need one.<br/>

Apple hasn't updated the stainless steel <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU9A3AM/A/42mm-silver-link-bracelet">Link Bracelet</a> since the original Apple Watch was released in 2015. The band is still listed in its original 38mm and 42mm sizes for &#36;449.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is kicking off the new year with an all-time low price on Apple's AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. There's an estimated delivery date of January 7 for most residences in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/AirPods-Pro-Case-With-USB-C.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909509" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
We haven't tracked an all-time low price on this model of the AirPods Pro 2 since around early December. This is largely the same model as the AirPods Pro 2 from 2022, with the addition of a USB-C port on the MagSafe Charging Case, instead of Lightning.<br/>
<br/>

		<title>Sketchy Rumor Says Vision Pro Will Launch in Final Week of January</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Vision Pro headset will launch in the last week of January, a sketchy online report coming out of China claims.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-WWCD23-Vision-Pro-EyeSight-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-922614" /><br/>
The information comes from <a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/livenews/2603883"><em>Wall Street Insights</em></a>, a Chinese investor news service with an unproven track record for Apple rumors. The website claims to have obtained exclusive information suggesting that the Vision Pro will launch on Saturday, January 27 in the United States. While the report clearly says that the launch is set to occur on a date that falls on a Saturday in the United States, there is a chance that the website is actually referring to January 27 in China, which falls on Friday, January 26 in the United States – a much more likely date for the launch of the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has rarely launched any of its hardware products on Saturdays, so it seems very unlikely that the Vision Pro headset would be the first. The company likely prefers to launch products on weekdays to align with normal business hours, ensuring maximum media coverage and stock market reaction. Friday, January 26 is likely also a more accurate interpretation since Apple overwhelmingly chooses Fridays to launch its new devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple simply says that the Vision Pro headset will launch "early" this year and has not yet announced any specific time frame for pre-orders and the product's launch. Oft-accurate Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/25/vision-pro-mass-shipments-timing-kuo/">recently said</a> that he expects the Vision Pro to hit shelves in late January or early February, which effectively lines up with this latest report from China. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, on the other hand, has been firmer in saying that Apple is planning the device's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/vision-pro-february-launch/">retail launch for February</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/02/vision-pro-could-launch-in-last-week-of-january/">Sketchy Rumor Says Vision Pro Will Launch in Final Week of January</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sketchy-rumor-says-vision-pro-will-launch-in-final-week-of-january.2415237/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[2024 is shaping up to be a busy year for Apple with a large number of important new releases due across the company's product lines, but there are some noticeable absences from its rumored plans. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Logo-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924188" /><br/>
Using information from various analysts and reliable sources, here's everything we're no longer expecting Apple to release this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>iPhone SE 4</h3><br/>
While Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/06/iphone-se-4-canceled-kuo/">previously rumored</a> to be planning the launch of the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> for 2024, the company is now widely expected to release the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-se-5g-modem-2025-launch-rumor/">in 2025</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
The current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; launched in March 2022, meaning that it will be at least 33 months old by the time its successor arrives. The next-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is expected to feature a design <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-se-4-iphone-14-chassis/">based on the iPhone 14</a>, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/suppliers-bidding-on-iphone-se-4-displays/">OLED display</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-se-4-reuse-iphone-14-battery/">larger battery</a>, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/iphone-se-4-to-feature-action-button-and-more/">Action Button, USB-C port, Face ID</a>, and potentially Apple's first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/kuo-iphone-se-4-oled-display/">custom 5G cellular modem</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>AirTag 2</h3><br/>
Production of the second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> tracker was apparently due to kick off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/">in the fourth quarter of 2024</a>, but the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/airtag-2-postponed-until-2025/">latest forecast</a> from Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> claims that the accessory will not reach mass production and be released until 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/AirTag-2-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917578" /><br/>
According to Kuo, the second-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; will be part of a new spatial computing ecosystem that Apple is building, with the Vision Pro serving as the core to integrate other devices. A new &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; would likely incorporate Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, allowing for even more precise tracking at longer distances.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>MicroLED Apple Watch Ultra</h3><br/>
The first Apple device to offer a microLED display will apparently be an upcoming Apple Watch Ultra model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/microled-apple-watch-still-on-track-for-2025/">released in late 2025</a> or 2026. In fact, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/kuo-apple-watch-ultra-3-in-2024-odds-decreasing/">may not update</a> the Apple Watch Ultra in 2024 and hold off for the significant display upgrade the following year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Black-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905396" /><br/>
Apple's plan to bring a microLED display to the Apple Watch Ultra is very widely corroborated, starting with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/">report</a> from display analyst Ross Young in January 2023. The microLED display is expected to be 2.12-inches in size, a 10% increase over the display of the current Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
The advanced display technology offers improved brightness, color reproduction, dynamic range, viewing angles, and efficiency, making images look more like they are "painted" atop the display glass. The project is part of Apple's plan to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/">reduce its reliance on Samsung</a> as a supplier while yielding benefits from engineering its own displays in-house, just like its chip technology.<br/>
<br/>
While <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/cheaper-airpods-and-micro-led-apple-watch-rumors/">initial reports</a> distinctively placed the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a> Ultra in 2024, the latest reports point to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/">late 2025</a> or potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/apple-watch-ultra-with-microled-to-launch-in-2026/">even 2026</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>iMac Pro</h3><br/>
Apple is still rumored to be working on a high-end "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> Pro" model with a 32-inch mini-LED display and a larger <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/imac-pro-2022-rumors/">selection of ports</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
Despite the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/imac-pro-officially-discontinued/">discontinuation of the iMac Pro</a> and any &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; models larger than 24-inches in 2021, Apple is still said to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/imac-with-over-30-inch-display/">plans to launch</a> a substantially bigger and more powerful &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; model.<br/>
<br/>
While <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">floated the possibility</a> of the machine launching in late 2024, 2025 may be a more likely time frame.   &zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj; has similarly said that the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">launch in 2025</a>, so the 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; may well continue to be the only Apple all-in-one desktop available this year. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Foldable iPhone and iPad</h3><br/>
Apple has been known to be working on foldable display technology for many years, filing multiple patents related to the technology, but a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> still seems to be quite some time away.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="820" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-797663" /><br/>
Rumors in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/">September 2020</a> indicated that Samsung was providing foldable display samples to Apple for a future foldable ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌, but there had been no strong indication that Apple was planning to use Samsung's technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-foldable-panels-samsung-display/">until recently</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021, <em>Bloomberg</em> claimed that Apple had started "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor/">early work</a>" on an ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ with a foldable display, but that it had not committed to releasing a foldable device at that time. Development in 2021 had not expanded beyond a display, and Apple did not have full foldable ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ prototypes. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj; initially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphones-with-under-screen-touch-id-now-coming-in-2023-foldable-iphone-in-2024/">said</a> that Apple would introduce a foldable ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ in 2024, but in 2022, he revised his prediction and said that Apple is unlikely to unveil a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; until <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/apple-testing-9-inch-foldable/">2025 or later</a>. Display analyst Ross Young has also suggested <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/21/apple-exploring-20-inch-foldable-macbook/">2025</a> is the earliest that we might see a foldable ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to bring a foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to market before a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but for the time being, the company is said to be focused on expanding OLED displays throughout the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Mac lineups and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/apple-focusing-on-oled-rather-than-foldable-ipad/">considering the potential</a> of offering a foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; even further in the future.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/01/apple-products-were-not-expecting-to-launch-in-2024/">Apple Products We&#039;re NOT Expecting to Launch in 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-products-were-not-expecting-to-launch-in-2024.2415157/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has broken a tradition it maintained for 12 years, releasing no new iPads in 2023 – the first time that the company has chosen to not launch a new tablet in an entire calendar year since the introduction of the product line.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/aapl-logo-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="890" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-776656" /><br/>
From its debut in 2010, the iPad has been an important product for Apple and the clear tablet market leader, releasing at least one new model every year. In recent times, the company has released as many as four new iPad models per year. Before 2023, 2009 was the last year with no new iPads, simply because the product line had not yet launched. <br/>
<br/>
The most recent iPad launches took place in October 2022. The only iPad-adjacent hardware released in 2023 was the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">Apple Pencil with USB-C</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li><strong>2010</strong>: iPad (1st generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2011</strong>: iPad 2</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2012</strong>: iPad (3rd generation), iPad (4th generation), and iPad mini (1st generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2013</strong>: iPad Air (1st generation) and iPad mini 2</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2014</strong>: iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2015</strong>: iPad mini 4 and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2016</strong>: iPad Pro 9.7-inch</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2017</strong>: iPad (5th generation), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation), and iPad Pro 10.5-inch</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2018</strong>: iPad (6th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2019</strong>: iPad (7th generation), iPad Air (3rd generation), and iPad mini (5th generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2020</strong>: iPad (8th generation), iPad Air (4th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (2nd generation), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (4th generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2021</strong>: iPad (9th generation), iPad mini (6th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2022</strong>: iPad (10th generation), iPad Air (5th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (4th generation), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2023</strong>: <em>None</em></li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
This hiatus in new iPad releases is noteworthy considering the history of the product line and could signal a moment of reflection about the direction of the device. As the iPad has become more advanced and widely adopted, the urgency for frequent upgrades has diminished for many potential customers. This shift in consumer behavior could have prompted Apple to reevaluate its tablet strategy, focusing on more impactful and less frequent hardware updates.<br/>
<br/>
Another aspect to consider is the criticism Apple has faced regarding the increasing complexity of the iPad lineup and questions around the direction of iPadOS. By taking a year off from new releases, Apple may be planning to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/what-the-2024-ipad-lineup-could-look-like/">reshape the lineup</a> with a clearer sense of purpose going forward.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors and analyst forecasts suggest that 2024 will be a much more significant year for the iPad lineup, with every model, encompassing the entry-level iPad, iPad mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, expected to receive a hardware refresh. With the rumored introduction of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">12.9-inch iPad Air</a> model, 2024 could see Apple launch an unprecedented six iPad models in a single calendar year. The flagship iPad Pro is expected to introduce at least <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/2024-ipad-pro-what-to-expect/">a dozen new features</a>, including OLED display technology, the M3 chip, and a new, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">"laptop-like" keyboard accessory</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/01/apple-just-broke-a-tradition-it-held-for-12-years/">Apple Just Broke a Tradition It Held for 12 Years</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-just-broke-a-tradition-it-held-for-12-years.2415136/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[2023 is quickly drawing to close, so it's a traditional time for us to look back at everything that happened in the Apple world over the past year and look forward to what we're expecting to see in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/top-stories-30dec2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928492" /><br/>
While the news and rumor cycle largely slows down at this time of year, the past couple of weeks have been dominated by developments in a patent dispute that saw Apple forced to briefly halt U.S. sales of the latest Apple Watch models before a court paused the ban. Make sure to read on below for the latest developments in this case and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 Once Again Available to Purchase From Apple's Online Store</h2><br/>
Last week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-pausing-series-9-ultra-2-sales-in-us/">paused sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the U.S.</a> due to a patent dispute with medical tech company Masimo related to blood oxygen sensing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-ultra-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913279" /><br/>
In January, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/apple-watch-masimo-patent-infringement/">infringed on a Masimo patent</a> related to blood oxygen sensing, and it ordered an import and sales ban for Apple Watch models offering the feature. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/26/apple-watch-import-ban-official/">Apple appealed the decision</a> in court and was granted a temporary stay, so the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused/">ban is lifted</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-online/">sales have resumed</a> for now.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What to Expect From Apple in 2024: Vision Pro, iPhone 16 Models, Revamped iPad Pro and More</h2><br/>

<h2>New iOS Features Coming in 2024 for Messages, Apple Music, and More</h2><br/>
2024 is just a few days away, and there are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/new-ios-features-launching-in-2024/">many iOS 17 and iOS 18 features</a> that are expected to launch throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912514" /><br/>

<br/>
<h2>Kuo: Vision Pro Likely to Launch by Early February</h2><br/>
Apple will likely <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/25/vision-pro-mass-shipments-timing-kuo/">begin selling the Vision Pro in the U.S. in late January or early February</a>, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" /><br/>
Apple first announced the Vision Pro at WWDC in June, and said it would launch in the U.S. in early 2024, followed by more countries later in the year. Kuo estimates that Vision Pro shipments in 2024 will reach approximately 500,000 units, which would make it a low-volume product.<br/>
