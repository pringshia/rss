		<description><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Peloton said that it would drop support for Apple's GymKit feature that syncs data to the Health app. Customers were unhappy with the decision and complained to the company, leading Peloton to announce a change in plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757966" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/peloton-bike-plus-treadmill-gymkit.jpg" alt="" width="921" height="457" /><br/>
<br/>
Peloton on Thursday said that after listening to member feedback on GymKit, the integration will continue to be offered.<br/>
<br/>
Peloton wanted to stop offering GymKit integration in favor of the Peloton One-Tap tracking feature, but GymKit has been a key feature on the &#36;2,500 Bike+ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/08/peloton-announces-bike-gymkit-support/">since its 2020 debut</a>, and other Peloton machines since 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After listening to Members’ feedback about discontinuing Apple GymKit integration for Bike+, we have decided to continue offering Apple GymKit integration. As a Member-first company, we are always grateful to our Members for sharing their views.</p>&mdash; Peloton (@onepeloton) <a href="https://twitter.com/onepeloton/status/1758588966276870466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
The One-Tap tracking app does monitor distance, pace, and heart rate metrics, but only basic information is synced to the Apple Health app. With GymKit, data like cadence, average speed, and average power is also available in the Health app for Peloton users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peloton/">Peloton</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/peloton-apple-gymkit-support/">Peloton Reverses Course, Will Continue to Support Apple GymKit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/peloton-reverses-course-will-continue-to-support-apple-gymkit.2419666/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today marks the two-week anniversary of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> launch, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/vision-pro-return-friday/">last day for returns</a> for those who purchased on release day. With plenty of stories going around from those who decided not to keep the &#36;3,500 device, <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera thought he'd share some of the reasons why he'll be keeping his headset.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lnQld2M8P4A" title="Apple Vision Pro Review: Why I am KEEPIN" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
We need to have a few Vision Pro headsets on hand to write about them here at <em>MacRumors</em>, so that's one of the primary reasons that Dan will be keeping his. Apple is already working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2, and we're interested in seeing what changes and updates are in store. We're also getting new apps on a regular basis, all of which make the Vision Pro a more appealing device.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro is the best way to be immersed in a movie, especially 3D movies, and that's another key reason why Dan won't be bringing his back to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>. The Cinema Environment that shuts out the world is hard to beat because it's basically your own personal movie theater.<br/>
<br/>
Working on the Vision Pro needs some improvement, perhaps with support for multiple Mac displays, but it's useful when traveling with a laptop. It would also be nice to be able to use a mouse, but Magic Keyboard and Trackpad input work well enough.<br/>
<br/>
There are some downsides to the Vision Pro. It's hard to wear for more than about an hour, the battery life is awful, and it doesn't hold a charge at all when not in use. Touch typing with the air keyboard is a poor experience, Personas need a lot of work to be less creepy, there still aren't a whole lot of groundbreaking app experiences, and Guest Mode is awful, so it is fully understandable why we're hearing a lot of return stories.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to watch Dan's full video to get his thoughts on the Vision Pro after two weeks, and let us know if you kept or returned your Vision Pro in the comments below.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/vision-pro-2-week-review/">Review: Two Weeks With the Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-two-weeks-with-the-apple-vision-pro.2419660/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following our previous in-depth coverage of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">various camera bump designs</a> Apple has tested for it, new information has surfaced on social media website X from user Majin Bu. Although this user has a mixed track record, they have occasionally provided accurate information on the design of upcoming iPhones, and their latest post could very well be our first look at a genuine &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; part.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-16-at-7.05.28 PM.png" alt="" width="2062" height="1160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936878" /><br/>
In <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1758491579067650512">their post</a>, Bu shared an image of what appears to be the main camera chassis for the base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, featuring a vertical camera layout. Although the part image was posted upside down, as pointed out by users <a href="https://twitter.com/axoajo/status/1758523318976549339">replying</a> to Bu's post, this does not affect the authenticity of the component itself.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> is able to independently verify the authenticity of the component design pictured above. Through our industry sources, we are able to confirm that the item featured in Bu’s post is the main camera chassis for the I-34 camera project, intended for use in the base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; set to be released later this year. <br/>
<br/>
This latest component leak aligns with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/22/iphone-16-vertical-camera-lenses-rumor/">multiple reports</a> concerning the new vertical camera layout Apple has planned for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. As seen in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/early-iphone-16-prototypes/">our December report on early iPhone 16 prototypes</a>, along with our coverage of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">more recent internal designs</a>, Apple has decided to align the cameras vertically, as opposed to the current diagonal layout found on the base model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. By employing a vertical camera layout, Apple could bring Spatial Video recording to the base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, expanding the feature's overall availability to the entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; range.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the vertical camera layout, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; is also expected to receive the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">Action button</a> as a carryover from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and will have an additional <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">Capture button</a> featuring force-sensor technology, located on the right side of the device.<br/>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite_apple_featured.jpg" alt="" width="2140" height="1204" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-754674" /><br/>
In its <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review">2023 Year in Review</a>, Epic said that it received its Apple Developer Account and would soon start developing an alternative app marketplace. The &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store will launch on iOS in the EU at some point in 2024, and it will provide a way for &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; to bring a Fortnite app to iOS once again.<br/>
<br/>
Fortnite was removed from the iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/">the start of the Epic Games v. Apple feud</a> in 2020, and it has been unavailable since then. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; did bring it to iPhones and iPads <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/05/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming/">through Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and GeForce NOW, but the game has only been accessible through these browser-based services.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after Apple's alternative app marketplace plan was announced, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; promised that Fortnite would "return to iOS" in Europe, and at the same time, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; CEO Tim Sweeney lambasted Apple's plan to comply with the DMA. He called it a "devious new instance of Malicious Compliance" and said that the company "strongly reject[s] Apple's twisting this process to undermine competition and continue imposing Apple taxes on transactions they're not involved in."<br/>
<br/>
While working to implement the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store on iOS, Epic also plans to continue to "argue to the courts and regulators that Apple is breaking the law."<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/epic-games-store-ios-eu/">Epic Games Plans for Alternative App Marketplace in EU as Apple Reinstates Developer Account</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-plans-for-alternative-app-marketplace-in-eu-as-apple-reinstates-developer-account.2419640/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will include a "slew of new AI features," according to a report this week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-15/apple-s-ai-plans-github-copilot-rival-for-developers-tool-for-testing-apps">from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iOS-18-Mock-iPhone-16-Feature-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936483" /><br/>
The report claims that Apple is training both Siri and the iPhone's built-in Spotlight search tool on large language models, with a goal of improving each feature's ability to answer more complex questions accurately. The revamped version of Spotlight could also offer deeper integration with "specific" functions and features in apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also explored AI-powered features that would allow users to automatically generate playlists in Apple Music and presentation slides in the Keynote app, the report said. Other apps that are rumored to gain deeper AI integration in iOS 18 include Health, Messages, Numbers, Pages, and Shortcuts, and there will likely be more.<br/>
<br/>
On an earnings call this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on generative AI and would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a> Apple is expected to announce iOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update should be released in September. Some new AI features announced later could be exclusive to iPhone 16 models, which are rumored to get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" upgraded Neural Engine</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, Gurman said Apple is planning to add some new AI features to macOS 15, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/apple-xcode-ai-tool-for-coding/">to its app development tool Xcode</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">iOS 18 Rumored to Include &#039;Slew of New AI Features&#039; for Siri and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumored-to-include-slew-of-new-ai-features-for-siri-and-more.2419635/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Newly established luxury airline Beond has announced it will offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headsets to select passengers for "an immersive inflight entertainment experience."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/beond-airline.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936752" /><br/>
The premium leisure airline said it will provide the Apple devices to passengers on its flights to the Maldives, where the airline is based. From the <a href="https://flybeond.com/latestnews">press release</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Beond's Chairman and CEO, Tero Taskila, said: "The Apple Vision Pro will transform the inflight entertainment experience, and we will be first to offer it to select passengers. In addition to our existing and ever-growing library of inflight content such as movies and games, Beond will showcase stunning resort destinations and activities in the Maldives. We are working now with partners in the Maldives to prepare truly amazing footage. The inflight experience will build anticipation for passengers before they arrive in the Maldives. Offering the Apple Vision Pro is another step in our vision of delivering a premium travel experience to our customers, from the start to finish of their journey. We're proud to be the first airline to deploy the technology."</blockquote>The overall response to &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; from users, critics, and the broader public has been varied. However, the consensus is that wearing the headset during flights stands out as one of its most widely appreciated applications.<br/>
<br/>
Acknowledging the headset's potential to make long-haul flights more private and liberating, Apple has included a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/apple-vision-pro-guest-user-and-travel-modes/">Travel mode</a> in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> that stabilizes visuals for users on an airplane, allowing them to, for example, watch movies on a massive virtual screen.<br/>

Beond said it will offer "Apple's ground-breaking content experience" beginning in July 2024. The news follows Beond's launch of commercial passenger services in 2023 from Munich, Zurich, and Riyadh to Malé, Maldives. Beond says it plans to debut flights from Milan, Dubai, and Bangkok to the Maldives in mid-2024, in an all-lay flat seating configuration. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/premium-leisure-airline-apple-vision-pro/">Premium Airline Beond to Offer Passengers Apple Vision Pro Headsets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/premium-airline-beond-to-offer-passengers-apple-vision-pro-headsets.2419609/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has suspended its development of a foldable iPhone after supplier displays failed to pass the company's own stringent testing standards, claims a new rumor coming out of China.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/foldable-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="1995" height="1057" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872750" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/O0Gc56ZPu">Fixed Focus Digital</a>, a Weibo-based tech video blogger from Guangdong with a huge Chinese following, Apple has been testing rival foldable phones as part of its research and development process into foldable devices, which is believed to have been going on since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/12/16/lg-foldable-displays-iphone/">2016</a>. <br/>
<br/>
At least one of the foldables that Apple is said to have been testing uses a display made by Samsung. Samsung is a major supplier of display panels used in Apple devices, and is known to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/">provided foldable display samples to Apple</a> in the past. A recent report also claimed that Samsung has been attempting to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-foldable-panels-samsung-display/">strengthen its operational efficiency</a> in anticipation of Apple's first foldable products by integrating the expertise it has gained making foldable devices since 2019. <br/>
<br/>
However, the source of today's rumor claims that Samsung's latest folding panels "broke down after a few days" under Apple's rigorous internal testing, which has caused Apple to put the entire project on ice for the foreseeable future, or at least until a display that can meet its high standards can be developed.<br/>
<br/>
According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-continuing-work-on-folding-iphones/">report</a> from <em>The Information</em> earlier this month, Apple has been actively building prototypes of at least two foldable iPhones following over five years of research and development. The two iPhone prototypes are said to fold widthwise like a clamshell, but do not feature in Apple's product roadmap for 2024 or 2025. The report noted that the foldable iPhones could still be canceled if they do not meet Apple's standards.<br/>
<br/>
The Weibo account purporting to have received information about the foldable project's suspension at Apple is a largely unknown quantity, having no previous track record for Apple rumors to our knowledge, therefore skepticism about its accuracy is warranted. <br/>
<br/>
It's also unclear whether the claim impacts Apple's continuing work on a foldable iPad. Apple is rumored to be more interested in such a device, which could be thicker than a foldable ‌iPhone‌ since users would not expect to carry it in their pocket and it would not need to pass the high durability requirements of an ‌iPhone‌. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Korean outlet <em>The Elec</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/">reported</a> that Apple is considering launching its first foldable in the next few years in the form of a 7- to 8-inch device that could ultimately replace the 8.3-inch iPad mini.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/foldable-iphone-paused-failing-screens/">Foldable iPhone Development Allegedly Paused Due to Failing Screens</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-development-allegedly-paused-due-to-failing-screens.2419605/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Negotiating With OLED Suppliers for Next Year&#039;s iPhone SE 4</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Several of Apple's display suppliers have proposed their prices for supplying OLED displays for the fourth-generation iPhone SE, <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4724">The Elec</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
Samsung Display, BOE, and Tianma are all said to have entered their proposed prices for OLED panels for the iPhone SE 4, which is expected to launch next year. Previous iPhone SE models have all used LCD displays.<br/>
<br/>
The report's sources said Samsung offered the lowest unit price of &#36;30, BOE offered &#36;35, and Tianma &#36;40. Apple is reportedly haggling for &#36;20, and negotiations are ongoing. Display manufacturers are believed to have been bidding to supply the panels since at least <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/suppliers-bidding-on-iphone-se-4-displays/">last August</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The panel prices are said to be a lot lower than suppliers charge for the OLED displays used in the iPhone 15, because the panels for the SE will use legacy parts identical to those used in the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, so the suppliers won't need to make new investments in R&D.<br/>
<br/>
In that respect, Samsung is said to have an advantage over its rivals since the Korean company can use its existing iPhone 14 OLED inventory.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ will feature a 6.1-inch OLED display with a design similar to the iPhone 14. The ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 is also expected to use the exact same battery found in the base model iPhone 14.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the new model is likely to be equipped with an Action button and USB-C port, which we've covered extensively in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/">previous reports</a>. As things stand, it could be one of the first devices to feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-se-5g-modem-2025-launch-rumor/">Apple-designed modem chip</a>, too.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/apple-iphone-se-4-oled-panel-orders/">Apple Negotiating With OLED Suppliers for Next Year&#039;s iPhone SE 4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-negotiating-with-oled-suppliers-for-next-years-iphone-se-4.2419597/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft does not plan to bring an Xbox Cloud Gaming app to iOS at this time because there's no opportunity for monetization, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games">The Verge</a></em>. When asked whether Apple's recent app ecosystem changes in the European Union make "room" for Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS, Spencer said that monetization was an issue, and that the Digital Markets Act forcing Apple's updates does not "go far enough to open up competition."<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-758525" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/App-Store-and-XCloud.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" /><br/>
<blockquote>There's not room for us to monetize Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS. I think the proposal that Apple put forward -- and I thought Sarah Bond's comments on this were right on -- doesn't go far enough to open up. In fact, you might even say they go the opposite direction in some way, but they definitely don't go far enough to open up competition on the world's largest gaming platform.<br/>
<br/>
We will continue to work with regulators, and Apple and Google, to create a space for alternative storefronts. I'm a big fan of how Windows works, and you've got a Microsoft Store on Windows, you've got Steam, you've got the Epic Games Store, you've got GOG. You have alternatives, and I think alternative ways for people to buy things creates goodness for consumers and creators. I think the largest platform for gamers, which is mobile, should have the same.</blockquote><br/>
Spencer said that earlier comments <a href="https://twitter.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1752083596318593238">from Xbox President Sarah Bond</a> were "right on." Back in January, Bond said that Apple's policy is a "step in the wrong direction." According to Spencer, Microsoft plans to continue to work with regulators to "create a space for alternative storefronts."<br/>
<br/>
In the European Union, the Digital Markets Act requires Apple to allow for alternative app marketplaces and alternative payment methods, but Apple is requiring developers who opt to use an alternative app marketplace to agree to new business terms that include a Core Development Fee of .50 euros per user. Companies like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/spotify-on-apple-eu-app-changes/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/fortnite-returning-to-ios-in-europe/">Epic Games</a> have criticized Apple's implementation of the DMA's requirements. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said that Apple's plan is a "complete and total farce," while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> CEO Tim Sweeney said Apple's implementation is a "devious new instance of malicious compliance."<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the changes in the European Union under the DMA, Apple also changed its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies around cloud gaming apps. Apple now allows streaming game apps on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; worldwide, with the apps able to offer a selection of games from within a single app. Previously, cloud gaming services were only available via a web interface.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/xbox-cloud-gaming-ios-microsoft/">Microsoft Not Planning on Xbox Cloud Gaming App for iOS Because There&#039;s &#039;Not Room&#039; for Monetization</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-not-planning-on-xbox-cloud-gaming-app-for-ios-because-theres-not-room-for-monetization.2419572/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.3, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. iOS 17.3 is no longer being signed following the February 8 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/apple-releases-ios-17-3-1-with-fix-for-text-bug/">release of iOS 17.3.1</a>, an update that added a fix for a text-related bug.<br/>
<br/>

Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS, so it is not unusual that the iOS 17.3 update is no longer available. Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent downgrading to older, less secure versions of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; operating system.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3.1 is now the only publicly released version of iOS available, but Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">also beta testing iOS 17.4</a>. Both developers and public beta testers can download and install iOS 17.4, with the update adding a number of App Store-related changes in the EU, new emoji, transcripts in the Podcasts app, and more.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-3/">Apple Stops Signing iOS 17.3, Downgrading No Longer Available</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-3-downgrading-no-longer-available.2419569/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on an updated version of Xcode that will include an AI tool for generating code, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-15/apple-s-ai-plans-github-copilot-rival-for-developers-tool-for-testing-apps">Bloomberg</a></em>. The AI tool will be similar to GitHub Copilot from Microsoft, which can generate code based on natural language requests and convert code from one programming language to another.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-developer-app-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-795934" /><br/>
The Xcode AI tool will be able to predict and finish blocks of code, allowing developers to streamline their app creation process. Apple is now testing the functionality internally and plans to release it to third-party software developers "as early as this year."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also testing AI-generated code for testing apps, and has asked some engineers to try these features out internally.<br/>
<br/>
The artificial intelligence capabilities added to Xcode will join several other AI features that Apple plans to add to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and other built-in apps. Some new features could include the option to generate playlists in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and create slideshows in Keynote, with Apple also working on improved Spotlight search capabilities. Search could encompass specific features in apps and might also provide responses to complex questions, with the feature built using large language models.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple software chief Craig Federighi has asked employees to create as many new AI features as possible for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. Apple plans to introduce "a slew of new AI features," and &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will be marketed as one of the biggest updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> since it launched. Some of the AI features will come to macOS, but Apple plans to "take a gradual approach to AI development" with some features not coming "for years."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/machine-learning/">Machine Learning</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/apple-xcode-ai-tool-for-coding/">Apple Developing AI Tool to Help Developers Write Code for Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-developing-ai-tool-to-help-developers-write-code-for-apps.2419561/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After several months of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/astropad-slate-ipad-app/">beta testing</a>, Astropad is today officially launching its <a href="https://astropad.com/slate/">Astropad Slate</a> app for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. Slate turns an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; into a large trackpad for a Mac, complete with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> control.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/astropad-slate.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936696" /><br/>
With Slate, you can use an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; to perform several useful tasks. The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; serves as a cursor for controlling the desktop mouse, and a tap on the screen is used as a click.<br/>
<br/>
When you write on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, it is translated into typed text on the Mac, and there are two-finger gestures for actions like scrolling and zoom. If you have a newer &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that supports &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover, you can use the hover gestures. For older iPads, Astropad added a simulated hover option.<br/>
<br/>
In Mac apps that support drawing, sketching, and other creative work, you can use the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as a drawing tablet. It essentially serves as a no-screen interface for drawing, with the focus on the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/906009529?h=3570d6bc15&color=eb0c50&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
You'll need an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that runs iPadOS 15 or later and a Mac that runs macOS 11 or later to use Astropad Slate. The devices can be connected over Wi-Fi, Peer-to-Peer networking, or an appropriate USB cable.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://astropad.com/product/slate/">Astropad Slate app</a> is priced at &#36;19.99 and can be purchased from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[With the second beta of iOS 17.4, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu/">disabled much of the functionality</a> of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in the European Union. There was some speculation that it could be a temporary change or a bug related to some of the updates to the app ecosystem in Europe, but Apple has confirmed that PWAs were intentionally removed and won't be returning.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu">update on the Developer website</a> (via <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/15/ios-17-4-web-apps-european-union/">9to5Mac</a></em>),  Apple explains that users in the EU will not have access to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> web apps due to the support for alternative browser engines and the accompanying security risks and work required to implement a new solution.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; web apps are built on WebKit and its security architecture, and are designed to "align with the privacy and security model for native apps on iOS." Storage isolation and system prompts to access privacy functions on a per-site basis are crucial.<br/>
<br/>
Without isolation, Apple claims that malicious web apps could read data from other web apps and gain access to a user's camera, microphone, and location without user consent. To fix these security issues, Apple would need to build a new integration architecture, which it says is not practical because of the other Digital Markets Act requirements and because &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; web apps aren't used by many people.<br/>
<blockquote>The iOS system has traditionally provided support for Home Screen web apps by building directly on WebKit and its security architecture. That integration means Home Screen web apps are managed to align with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS, including isolation of storage and enforcement of system prompts to access privacy impacting capabilities on a per-site basis.<br/>
<br/>
Without this type of isolation and enforcement, malicious web apps could read data from other web apps and recapture their permissions to gain access to a user's camera, microphone or location without a user's consent. Browsers also could install web apps on the system without a user's awareness and consent. Addressing the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps using alternative browser engines would require building an entirely new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS and was not practical to undertake given the other demands of the DMA and the very low user adoption of Home Screen web apps. And so, to comply with the DMA's requirements, we had to remove the Home Screen web apps feature in the EU.</blockquote><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the European Union can access websites directly from the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; through a bookmark, but PWA features won't be available. Web apps on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; will be forced to open in Safari (or another default browser) rather than in a dedicated window, there isn't support for long-term local storage, and notifications won't work.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the changes are a direct result of DMA compliance, and will affect only a "small number of users." The company also says that it regrets the impact the change will have on developers of &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; web apps and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users.<br/>
<br/>
The update to &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; web apps comes alongside many other changes to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> in the European Union, with Apple allowing alternative app marketplaces, alternative payment methods, different browser engines, and more.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/ios-17-4-web-apps-removed-apple/">Apple Confirms iOS 17.4 Disables Home Screen Web Apps in the European Union</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-ios-17-4-disables-home-screen-web-apps-in-the-european-union.2419554/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Responds to Meta&#039;s Plan to Charge 30% Fee on Boosted Posts Purchased Through App Store</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In October 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/24/apple-updates-app-store-review-guidelines-2/">updated its App Store Review Guidelines</a> to clarify that sales of "boosted" posts in social media apps must use the App Store's in-app purchase system. Apple thereby receives up to a 30% cut of these sales.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Facebook-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786419" /><br/>
As a result of that clarification, Meta today <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-ways-for-small-business-to-boost-and-avoid-apple-service-charges">announced</a> that it will soon charge advertisers a 30% fee when they purchase boosted posts through the Facebook and Instagram apps for iOS. This policy will allow Meta to offset the amount that it will owe Apple for each sale — it is essentially passing on the added cost to its customers. Advertisers who purchase boosted posts through the iOS apps will also now be required to pay in advance, whereas Meta typically collects payment for boosted posts after they are shown.<br/>
<br/>
Meta said this change will take effect in the U.S. later this month, and in additional countries later this year. Advertisers can avoid the 30% fee and prepayment by purchasing boosted posts on the web at Facebook.com and Instagram.com.<br/>
<br/>
"We are required to either comply with Apple's guidelines, or remove boosted posts from our apps," said Meta, in a press release today. "We do not want to remove the ability to boost posts, as this would hurt small businesses by making the feature less discoverable and potentially deprive them of a valuable way to promote their business."<br/>
<br/>
Meta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/facebook-apple-app-store-guidelines-ads/">previously said</a> that "Apple continues to evolve its policies to grow their own business while undercutting others in the digital economy."<br/>
<br/>
Millions of small businesses use boosted posts on Facebook and Instagram, according to Meta. A boosted post is a key advertising tool for businesses, allowing them to reach larger audiences on Facebook and Instagram in exchange for payment.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Responds</h2><br/>
In response to Meta's announcement, Apple said App Store apps have always been required to use its in-app purchase system for the sale of digital goods and services.<br/>
<br/>
"We have always required that purchases of digital goods and services within apps must use In-App Purchase," said Apple, in a statement shared with <em>MacRumors</em> today. "Boosting, which allows an individual or organization to pay to increase the reach of a post or profile, is a digital service — so of course In-App Purchase is required. This has always been the case and there are many examples of apps that do it successfully."<br/>
<br/>
If boosted posts have always been considered a digital service, it is unclear why Apple has allowed Meta to directly charge advertisers for many years, and it did not respond when we asked for an explanation. At a minimum, it appears that Apple has allowed Meta to circumvent the App Store's in-app purchase system for boosted posts since clarifying its App Store Review Guidelines in October 2022. That grace period is clearly ending now.<br/>
<br/>
As part of its response, Apple said it has indeed given Meta ample opportunity to comply with the App Store Review Guidelines as they are currently written.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added that businesses have the option to use the Meta Ads Manager app on iOS to set up and pay for their ad campaigns without using the App Store's in-app purchase system, as this app complies with the App Store Review Guidelines, which permit apps designed for the sole purpose of managing ad campaigns to offer direct payment options.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> In response to our inquiry, Apple said when it finds that an app is out of compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines, its general approach is to work with the developer to help bring them into compliance with the rules. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/apple-responds-to-meta-boosted-posts-fee/">Apple Responds to Meta&#039;s Plan to Charge 30% Fee on Boosted Posts Purchased Through App Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-responds-to-metas-plan-to-charge-30-fee-on-boosted-posts-purchased-through-app-store.2419553/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is still months away from being unveiled, but there are already rumors and expectations for the software update, as outlined below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-like generative AI features for Siri and several built-in Apple apps. The update is expected to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience with Android users. A sketchy rumor claimed that iOS 18 will also have some visionOS-inspired design changes.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 will be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update will be released to all users in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Generative AI and Smarter Siri</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to have new generative AI features for Siri, Shortcuts, Messages, Apple Music, Pages, and more. On a February 2024 earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on generative AI and would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a><br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">said</a> generative AI "should improve how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences." <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">said</a> Apple would incorporate large language models into Siri to let users automate complex tasks, a feature that would involve deeper integration with the Shortcuts app.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity in 2022 after OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts. Google, Microsoft, and other companies have also released similar chatbots and tools, including ones that can automatically generate images, respond to voice queries, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Some generative AI features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">might be exclusive to iPhone 16 models</a>, which are rumored to have a Neural Engine with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" more cores</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November 2023, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li><br/>
 <li>Improved encryption compared to SMS</li><br/>
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>

<h2>Biggest iOS Update Ever?</h2><br/>

Apple believes iOS 18 has the potential to be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/">"biggest" software update in the iPhone's history</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm told that the new operating system is seen within the company as one of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company's history," he wrote, in a January 2024 edition of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6">his <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>visionOS-Inspired Design Changes?</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-design.jpeg" alt="" width="1800" height="1012" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935810" /><br/>
iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">visionOS-inspired design elements</a>, according to a rumor shared by Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em>.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the report claimed that the Apple TV app on iPadOS 18 will feature the same translucent navigation bar that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">introduced in the tvOS 17.2 version of the app</a> in 2023. The design of this menu draws similarities to visionOS, the operating system that runs on Apple's new Vision Pro mixed reality headset.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to redesign various other system menus and built-in apps on iOS 18, including Safari, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Verifier</em> has a mixed track record with Apple rumors over the years, so this latest rumor should be treated with some skepticism.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
The AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C are available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. This is a match of the record low price on these AirPods, which feature a new USB-C port as well as improved dust resistance and 20-bit 48kHz lossless audio when paired with the Apple Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/02/apple-arcade-takes-players-into-a-new-dimension-with-spatial-gaming/">highlighted</a> spatial gaming experiences on the Vision Pro headset, claiming that it is "the beginning of a new era in gaming."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Arcade-spatial-gaming-hero.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936556" /><br/>
While over 250 games are available on the Vision Pro via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, the company drew particular attention to 12 "unique spatial games" offered exclusively via the gaming subscription service.<blockquote>Spatial games built specifically for Arcade on Apple Vision Pro unlock amazing new gameplay opportunities by blending digital content with the physical world. visionOS delivers powerful spatial experiences with a brand-new three-dimensional user interface and input system controlled entirely by a user's eyes, hands, and voice. Players are able to slice apples with their hands as their living room transforms into their very own dojo in Super Fruit Ninja, tee up the perfect shot as they move freely around a quirky golf course right in their home in WHAT THE GOLF?, escape into a mesmerizing audiovisual experience in Synth Riders, and so much more.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The featured spatial games on &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; include:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li>Game Room</li><br/>
	<li>WHAT THE GOLF?</li><br/>
	<li>Cut the Rope 3</li><br/>
	<li>Jetpack Joyride 2</li><br/>
	<li>Patterned</li><br/>

	<li>LEGO Builder's Journey</li><br/>
	<li>Bloons TD 6+</li><br/>
	<li>Super Fruit Ninja</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Apple added that "even more magical spatial gaming experiences" are coming soon to &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;, listing three upcoming titles:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li>Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City</li><br/>
	<li>Gibbon: Beyond the Trees</li><br/>
	<li>Spire Blast</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
