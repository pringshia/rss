		<description><![CDATA[Following the launch of the Vision Pro, Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214051#416">shared additional details</a> about the headset's Optic ID iris authentication option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-eye-tracking.jpg" alt="" width="2080" height="1170" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898908" /><br/>
Optic ID can recognize the uniqueness of your irises, the colored part of your eyes, allowing you to quickly unlock your Vision Pro, authorize Apple Pay purchases, sign in to many third-party apps, access sensitive personal data, and more. Apps that support Face ID and Touch ID on the iPhone and iPad automatically support Optic ID. After setting up Optic ID, it also becomes a requirement in order use your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-persona-tips/">Persona</a>.<br/>
<br/>
"In the same way that Touch ID revolutionized authentication using a fingerprint and Face ID revolutionized authentication using facial recognition, Optic ID revolutionizes authentication using iris recognition," says Apple. "Optic ID provides intuitive and secure authentication that uses the uniqueness of your iris, made possible by Apple Vision Pro's high-performance eye-tracking system of LEDs and infrared cameras."<br/>
<br/>
Optic ID scans both of your eyes by default. Given that the size of your irises and pupils change in various lighting conditions, Apple says Optic ID adapts by updating your enrolled template after each successful authentication. Apple ensures that <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/optic-id#416">all biometric data is encrypted</a> and never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
There is an accessibility option for using Optic ID with one eye only that can be turned on in the Settings app under Accessibility â†’ Eye Input. Optic ID can also be kept off entirely, in which case you authenticate with a passcode only.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Optic-ID.jpg" alt="" width="1178" height="663" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934569" /><br/>
For users who require vision correction, Optic ID works with the Vision Pro's ZEISS optical inserts and prescription soft contact lenses.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says Optic ID uses "advanced hardware and software" for iris recognition.<br/>
<br/>
"When you set up Optic ID, spatiotemporally modulated eye-safe near-infrared light illuminates the eye, so that the Apple Vision Pro eye cameras can capture images of your iris," says Apple. "This iris image data is sent to and processed on the Secure Enclave and a portion of the Apple M2 chip's neural engine that's protected within the Secure Enclave, where it is transformed into a mathematical representation for enrollment. When you authenticate with Optic ID, the authentication attempt uses the same process to compare your iris to the enrolled biometric data to determine whether there is a match."<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the Optic ID system complies with international safety standards and "won't cause harm to the eyes or skin due to the low output of the emitters."<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that a probability that a random person could unlock your Vision Pro using Optic ID is less than one in a million, similar to Face ID. The company explains that Optic ID matches against "detailed iris structure in the near-infrared domain," which "reveals highly unique patterns independent of iris pigmentation."<br/>
<br/>
Optic ID allows a maximum of five unsuccessful match attempts before a passcode is required. As an additional layer of protection, you can set the Vision Pro to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/apple-vision-pro/tanf79745605/visionos#416">erase all information, media, and personal settings</a> after 10 consecutive failed passcode attempts.<br/>
<br/>
You also need to enter your passcode when:<ul><li>The device has just been turned on or restarted.</li><br/>
<li>The device hasn't been unlocked for more than 48 hours.</li><br/>
<li>The passcode hasn't been used to unlock the device in the last six-and-a-half days and Optic ID hasn't unlocked the device in the last 4 hours.</li></ul>You may still be able to use Optic ID in these cases if your iPhone is nearby, as Apple explains in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213962#416">support document about setting up and using Optic ID</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/optic-id/">Optic ID</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/apple-vision-pro-optic-id/">Optic ID: Apple Explains Vision Pro&#039;s Iris Authentication System</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/optic-id-apple-explains-vision-pros-iris-authentication-system.2418352/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new Vision Pro headset can serve as an external display for a Mac, allowing you to view and control your computer in a visionOS window. The feature is even compatible with some older Intel-based Macs, with one limitation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Mac-Virtual-Display.jpg" alt="" width="1178" height="663" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934472" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213971#416">new support document</a>, Apple has confirmed that the Vision Pro's Mac Virtual Display feature is compatible with any Mac running macOS Sonoma. If the Mac has an Apple silicon chip, the headset can show its display at up to 4K resolution. If the Mac has an Intel processor, however, Apple says resolution is limited to up to 3K.<br/>
<br/>
macOS Sonoma is compatible with the following Macs:<ul><li><strong>MacBook Pro:</strong> 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>MacBook Air:</strong> 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac mini:</strong> 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>iMac:</strong> 2019 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>iMac Pro:</strong> 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac Studio:</strong> 2022 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac Pro:</strong> 2019 and later</li></ul>To use the feature, the Vision Pro and the Mac need to be signed in to the same Apple ID, and the account must have two-factor authentication turned on. In addition, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth must be enabled on both devices to establish a connection.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at a MacBook while wearing the Vision Pro, a "Connect" button will appear above it. For desktop Macs, or if the button fails to appear, Mac Virtual Display can also be turned on in the Vision Pro's Control Center.<br/>
<br/>
You can move your Mac's virtual display by pinching and dragging the window's bottom bar, and bring it closer or farther away. You can also resize the window by pinching and dragging the window bars that appear in the bottom corners.<br/>
<br/>
If your Mac has multiple external displays connected to it, the Vision Pro only shows the one set as the main display in the Mac's System Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
You can use your Mac's built-in keyboard and trackpad, or a paired Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad, to control both the Mac Virtual Display and other visionOS apps. However, the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-bluetooth-accessories/">cannot be used with a Bluetooth mouse</a>, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's instructions for turning on Universal Control:<blockquote>If you want to share the pointer between your macOS and visionOS apps, Handoff must be turned on on both devices. On Apple Vision Pro, go to Settings  > General > Handoff. On your Mac, go to System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff.<br/>
<br/>
On your Mac, you also need to turn on "Allow your pointer and keyboard to move between any nearby Mac or iPad." Go to System Settings > Displays, then click Advanced.</blockquote>A few other details shared by Apple:<ul><li>Mac Virtual Display does not work when your Vision Pro is in Guest Mode.</li><br/>
<li>Mac Virtual Display does not support managed Apple IDs.</li><br/>
<li>The devices must be no more than 10 meters (32 feet) apart to maintain a connection.</li></ul>More details about Mac Virtual Display can be found in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/apple-vision-pro/tan357ede966/visionos#416">Apple's Vision Pro User Guide</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/apple-vision-pro-can-display-intel-macs/">Apple Vision Pro&#039;s Virtual Display Feature Works With Intel Macs, But Limited to 3K Resolution</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pros-virtual-display-feature-works-with-intel-macs-but-limited-to-3k-resolution.2418329/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 17.4, currently in beta, Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">allowing alternative app marketplaces on the iPhone in the EU</a>. Apple made this change to comply with new regulations under the EU's Digital Markets Act, which takes full effect next month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/app-store-awards-2022.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876046" /><br/>
In an <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91021439/apple-phil-schiller-iphone-app-store-alternative-eu-risk-security">interview with <em>Fast Company</em></a>'s Michael Grothaus published today, Apple's former marketing chief and current App Store head Phil Schiller said there are privacy and security risks associated with these alternative app marketplaces:<blockquote>"These new regulations, while they bring new options for developers, also bring new risks. There's no getting around that. So we're doing everything we can to minimize those risks for everyone," Schiller told me in a recent discussion about the privacy and security impact of the European Commission's Digital Markets Act.</blockquote>One of these risks is the potential for users to download malicious or unsafe apps, although Apple will be notarizing all apps through a combination of automated processes and a basic human review in order to prevent these apps from being available on alternative app marketplaces as much as possible. Still, Apple has said notarization will not be as thorough as its App Store review process and guidelines that developers must adhere to.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-app-store-notarization-eu.jpg" alt="" width="2124" height="1195" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932861" /><br/>
Another risk is that the App Store's strict rules surrounding objectionable content might not extend to alternative app marketplaces, according to Schiller:<blockquote>"We have dealt with a lot of input from families, from governments, on things that we need to do to try to either not allow certain kinds of objectionable content on our App Store, or give users control over that experience to decide whatâ€™s best for themselvesâ€”and we have rules around that," Schiller says. "Those rules will not apply in another marketplace unless they choose to make rules of their own, [with] whatever criteria they come up with. Does that increase the risk of users, and families, running into objectionable content or other experiences? Yes, it does."</blockquote>Schiller's comments reiterate many of the risks that Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#ios-app-eu">outlined on its website</a>:<blockquote>If not properly managed, alternative distribution poses increased privacy, safety, and security risks for users and developers. This includes risks from installing software from unknown developers that are not subject to the Apple Developer Program requirements, installing software that compromises system integrity with malware or other malicious code, the distribution of pirated software, exposure to illicit, objectionable, and harmful content due to lower content and moderation standards, and increased risks of scams, fraud, and abuse. Apple has less ability to address these risks, and to support and refund customers regarding these issues. Even with safeguards, many of these risks remain.</blockquote>The full interview can be read on <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91021439/apple-phil-schiller-iphone-app-store-alternative-eu-risk-security"><em>Fast Company</em>'s website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/">Phil Schiller</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/phil-schiller-on-risks-of-iphone-app-marketplaces/">Apple&#039;s Phil Schiller Discusses Risks of Alternative App Stores on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-phil-schiller-discusses-risks-of-alternative-app-stores-on-iphone.2418312/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Vision Pro is here! Apple's "spatial computing" headset has officially launched, and we've got all the details on the ground-breaking new device for both early adopters and those just looking for more information as Apple takes in first step into what it believes is the future of computing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/top-stories-3feb2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934335" /><br/>
While the Apple Vision Pro launch was the biggest news of the week, it certainly wasn't the only topic making waves as Apple is continuing work on iOS 17.4 with a host of changes to how the app ecosystem will work in the European Union, we received word that iOS 18 coming later this year could be a massive update, and more, so read on below for more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Vision Pro Launches: 'The Era of Spatial Computing Has Arrived'</h2><br/>
After years of rumors, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-launch-day/">the Apple Vision Pro has finally launched</a>, at least in the United States. In-store launches began at 8:00 a.m. Friday, with pre-order deliveries also happening the same day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Fifth-Avenue-Vision-Pro-Launch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934152" /><br/>
Apple has shared a wealth of information alongside the launch, and we've rounded up quite a bit including an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-app-list/">extensive list of some of the 600 native apps</a> available for visionOS at launch, details on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-vision-pro-guest-mode/">how to let a guest try out your Vision Pro</a>, tips for making the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-persona-tips/">best possible virtual Persona</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-bluetooth-accessories/">accessories you can use with your Vision Pro</a>, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Hands-On With the Apple Vision Pro: Unboxing, Initial Thoughts and More</h2><br/>
We've picked up our own Vision Pro unit and put together a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/vision-pro-unboxing/">lengthy video outlining the unboxing, setup, and early impressions</a> of the lead device in Apple's latest product category.<br/>

There are certainly some mind-blowing aspects to the aspect, but there are other areas where the experience isn't ideal, so be sure to check out our initial coverage and stay tuned for more in-depth reports as we spend additional time with it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Seeds First iOS 17.4 Public Beta With EU App Ecosystem Changes and More</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-releases-ios-17-4-public-beta/">seeded the first public beta of iOS 17.4</a> with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">long list of changes to the App Store, Safari, Wallet, and more in the EU</a>. These changes are the result of Apple complying with new regulations set to be enforced next month under the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
iOS 17.4 will be released to all users in March, and the changes only apply to EU countries. We recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">recapped all of the changes</a> in one convenient list.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 Potentially 'Biggest' Software Update in iPhone's History</h2><br/>
iOS 18 has the potential to be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/">"biggest" software update in the iPhone's history</a>, according to info shared by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>

Gurman said he plans to share more details about specific iOS 18 features and changes that are planned in the future, but we already know about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/02/ios-18-features/">two new features that should be included in the update</a>, including RCS support in the Messages app and ChatGPT-like generative AI functionality for Siri.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and Spotify overwhelmingly dominate the music streaming space, but the two services offer surprisingly different experiences despite their competitive pricing, so which is best?<br/>

While Spotify has been around for longer than &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, both services are now very widely adopted. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and Spotify have similar libraries with over 100 million songs, with features like personalized playlists, live lyrics, collaboration, crossfade, and SharePlay support, making it all the more difficult to choose between them.

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Both &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and Spotify boast extensive music libraries, sophisticated personalization features, and comparable subscription models, but the nuances of their offerings cater to slightly different audiences. When choosing between the services, you should decide which of the two following groups you fall into.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; touts a seamless and feature-rich listening experience for Apple device users, offering particular advantages to those who are heavily embedded in Apple's ecosystem. The service is particularly appealing to audiophiles and those invested in high-quality audio, thanks to features like Lossless Audio and Spatial Audio. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s exclusive content, such as live radio shows and the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Classical app, provides unique value to those seeking more than just a vast music library. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; is the preferred choice for users who appreciate the convenience of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; integration, conventional library management, the ability to merge their own music library with the streaming service, and who are possibly already subscribed to other Apple services, making the &zwnj;Apple One&zwnj; bundle an attractive proposition.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify, on the other hand, excels in music discovery and social sharing. Its sophisticated algorithms that power features like Discover Weekly and Release Radar are unmatched for surfacing new music tailored to the listener's tastes. Spotify's cross-platform design and compatibility with a wide range of devices make it a versatile option for users with a diverse range of hardware. The service's superior social features, such as the ability to see what friends are listening to in real-time, enrich the music discovery process. Spotify is the go-to choice for users who value these social and discovery aspects highly, as well as those who appreciate the option of a free, ad-supported tier.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> supports Bluetooth, Apple said today <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213998">in a support document</a> that there is no guarantee that third-party Bluetooth accessories and devices will be compatible. Apple did, however, provide information on what will work for sure.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/mac-magic-keyboard.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-836750" /><br/>
<h2 id="airpodsbeats">AirPods/Beats</h2><br/>
All current models of AirPods and Beats headphones are able to connect to the Vision Pro. Apple recommends the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 with USB-C Charging Case for the best experience because it supports Lossless Audio and ultra-low latency, while older AirPods models do not.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="keyboards">Keyboards</h2><br/>
Most Bluetooth keyboards made by Apple and other manufacturers will work with the Vision Pro. The Vision Pro is not compatible with older Apple keyboards that use removable batteries.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro has a virtual keyboard that can be used, but for anything beyond entering a password or typing a quick message, users will want a Bluetooth keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="mice_and_trackpads">Mice and Trackpads</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; does not work with Bluetooth mice at all. It does work with the Apple Magic Trackpad, but older Trackpads with removable batteries are not compatible, nor are trackpads from other manufacturers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="controllers">Controllers</h2><br/>
All Made for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Bluetooth controllers can connect to the Vision Pro, including Xbox and PlayStation controllers. Apple says that any controller that works with iPadOS will work with Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>

Made for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; hearing devices are able to connect to the Vision Pro.

		<description><![CDATA[Traveling is perhaps one of the best uses of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, as it can be used on airplanes and has a specific Travel Mode. Apple today published several support documents that provide some important details on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214004">traveling with the Vision Pro</a>, activating the built-in Travel Mode, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214004">storing it</a> when it's not in use.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Travel-Mode.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930973" /><br/>
<h2 id="how_to_travel_with_vision_pro">How to Travel With Vision Pro</h2><br/>
The cover that comes with the Vision Pro should be placed on it to protect the glass before it is packed up, but Apple says users should also make sure there are no loose objects like keys or coins nearby that could scratch the internal displays.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recommends the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; Travel Case, which is &#36;200, a soft padded bag, or a "similar protective solution" to protect the Vision Pro from impacts and "excessive vibration." Apple's Travel Case is rather large, so it might be difficult to bring as a carry-on because of the space that it takes up.<br/>
<br/>
If the Vision Pro won't be used for an extended period, it should be disconnected from the battery, and Apple says that the ZEISS Optical Inserts should be packed separately so they don't accidentally detach.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="how_to_use_vision_pro_in_travel_mode">How to Use Vision Pro in Travel Mode</h2><br/>
Travel Mode is specifically designed for using the Vision Pro while on a flight. It can be activated from the Control Center by following these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Look up and then tap on the arrow near the top of the display to open Control Center.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on the Control Center button to see more options.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on the Travel Mode button.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap Turn on Travel Mode to confirm.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Exiting Travel Mode can be done by going back to Control Center and tapping "Turn Off."<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the Vision Pro cannot be set up on an airplane, and also Personas are not available when Travel Mode is turned on.<br/>
<h2 id="travel_mode_tips">Travel Mode Tips</h2><br/>
Apple says that users should follow these guidelines when using Travel Mode:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Remain seated while Travel Mode is on, and remove the Vision Pro before standing up. Features that help you stay aware of your surroundings are disabled when Travel Mode is activated.</li><br/>
 <li>Take off the Vision Pro during taxiing, takeoff, and landing. Also remove it if there is turbulence on the flight.</li><br/>
 <li>Avoid looking out the airplane's windows, because it can impact the Vision Pro's ability to detect your surroundings.</li><br/>
 <li>If content appears tilted or off-center, long-press on the Digital Crown to re-center the view.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="storing_vision_pro">Storing Vision Pro</h2><br/>
If the Vision Pro is not going to be in use for a while, Apple recommends taking these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Attach the cover to the Vision Pro to prevent dust accumulation or damage, but make sure the cover is clean and free of debris first.</li><br/>
 <li>Disconnect the battery.</li><br/>
 <li>Place the Vision Pro on a stable, flat surface with the cover glass facing forward. Do not put the Vision Pro facing downward. Alternatively, place it in the Vision Pro Travel Case.</li><br/>
 <li>The Vision Pro can withstand temperatures ranging from -4Âº to 113Âº F. It should not be stored in areas that exceed this range.</li><br/>
 <li>Do not leave the Vision Pro in a car because temperatures in parked cars can get too warm.</li><br/>
 <li>Do not leave the Vision Pro in direct sunlight for any length of time.</li><br/>
 <li>Make sure the relative humidity of where the Vision Pro is stored is between 0 percent and 95 percent.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
In day to day usage, Apple also suggests that users put the cover back on the Vision Pro whenever it's not being worn. Apple also warns against placing the Vision Pro with the glass facing downward, and says to put it on the polishing cloth rather than any rough or abrasive surface.<br/>
<br/>
Picking up the Vision Pro should always be done with two hands, and it should never be picked up by the Light Seal or Audio Straps.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-travel/">What You Need to Know About Traveling With Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-you-need-to-know-about-traveling-with-apple-vision-pro.2418238/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fit is the most important aspect of the Vision Pro, because if it's not on your head in the right way, it will feel heavy and uncomfortable, plus the displays might look blurry. Apple today published several support documents on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117730">getting a good fit</a> with the Vision Pro and what to do if you have <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213953">light leakage</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214019">eye setup issues</a>, and other problems.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929939" /><br/>
<h2 id="selecting_a_band">Selecting a Band</h2><br/>
There are two bands for the Vision Pro, the Solo Knit Band and the Dual Loop Band. With either band, the Vision Pro should feel balanced across the cheeks and forehead, and it should be snug but not too tight. A head band that is too tight can cause skin sensitivity, general discomfort, or marks and indentations on the face, but Apple says that some "temporary, light markings" are expected after general usage.<br/>
<br/>
Users should select the band that feels the most comfortable, and then adjust from there.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="solo_knit_band_adjustments">Solo Knit Band Adjustments</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Rotate the Fit Dial counterclockwise and pull the device by the frame away from the face to loosen the band if it's too tight. If it won't loosen enough, you might need a larger size.</li><br/>
 <li>If the band feels too loose, turn it clockwise to tighten it. If it won't tighten more, a different size might be required.</li><br/>
 <li>If you feel pressure on your forehead, raise the Solo Knit Band by pulling it up slightly on the back of the head.</li><br/>
 <li>To fix pressure on the cheeks, lower the Solo Knit Band by pulling it slightly down on the back of the head.</li><br/>
 <li>To relieve pressure across the bridge of the nose, swap to the Light Cushion marked with a + or use the Dual Loop Band.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3 id="dual_loop_band_adjustments">Dual Loop Band Adjustments</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>If the head band is too tight, hold the Vision Pro to your face and loosen the upper and lower straps of the Dual Loop Band with the other hand. Pull the device by the frame away from your face.</li><br/>
 <li>To relieve pressure on the forehead, hold the frame, loosen the lower strap, and tighten the upper strap.</li><br/>
 <li>To relieve pressure on the cheeks, hold the frame, pull down the lower strap, and loosen the upper strap.</li><br/>
 <li>To relieve pressure across the bridge of the nose, swap to the Light Cushion marked with a + or use the Solo Knit Band.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3 id="light_seal_cushion_fit">Light Seal Cushion Fit</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>If your eyelashes brush against the Vision Pro or you get a notification that your eyes are too close, swap to the Light Cushion marked with a +. If that does not fix it, a different Light Seal size might be required.</li><br/>
 <li>If your eyes are too far from the displays, swap to the thinner Light Seal Cushion. If that does not work, a different Light Seal Size might be required.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="realign_displays">Realign Displays</h2><br/>
If you feel pressure on the bridge of your nose and adjustments to the band don't help, Apple suggests using the Realign Displays feature under Settings > Eyes and Hands.<br/>
<br/>
To move the displays slightly away from the nose, press the Top Button to move the displays outward. Press and hold the Digital Crown to move the displays inwards for ideal visual alignment.<br/>
<h2 id="fixing_light_leakage">Fixing Light Leakage</h2><br/>
Apple says to determine whether you're experiencing light leakage, you should use the Vision Pro in both a brightly lit and dimly lit room.<br/>
<br/>
If the Vision Pro experience improves in a dimly lit room, there is a light leakage problem that needs to be addressed by adjusting the fit of the Vision Pro head band or choosing a different Light Seal Cushion.<br/>
<br/>
If the dimly lit room does not improve the experience, Apple says there may be light originating from the display causing some reflections within the optical system.<br/>
<br/>
Some light leakage around the nose is normal.<br/>
<h2 id="tips_for_getting_a_good_fit">Tips for Getting a Good Fit</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Apple suggests that facial jewelry like nose rings or eyebrow rings should be removed before you put on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>.</li><br/>
 <li>Uneven facial discomfort, such as pressure on the forehead, cheeks, or nose, is an indication that a different Light Seal or Light Seal Cushion might be required. Other signs include light leakage, eyelashes brushing on the display, and alerts about eye position.</li><br/>
 <li>Make sure that hair does not get caught in either the band or the cable to avoid tugging.</li><br/>
 <li>The Vision Pro is not designed to be worn by children under the age of 13 and it may not fit.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="solving_eye_setup_issues">Solving Eye Setup Issues</h2><br/>
If the Vision Pro eye setup feature cannot be completed, Apple has several solutions.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Ensure that the fit is correct and follow the directions of any alerts that are shown on the display.</li><br/>
 <li>If you're experiencing issues with eye setup, Apple warns that eyelash extensions and items near the eyes like rhinestones or glitter can cause problems.</li><br/>
 <li>Eyes that are too wet or too dry might impact eye setup.</li><br/>
 <li>Debris on the Vision Pro display or ZEISS Optical Inserts can cause issues.</li><br/>
 <li>Cosmetic contact lenses are not compatible with Vision Pro and need to be removed.</li><br/>
 <li>Hard contact lenses might not work with Vision Pro.</li><br/>
 <li>Medical conditions like eyelid drooping, changes in eye alignment, or uncontrolled eye movements can make it difficult for the Vision Pro to detect your eyes. There are <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/get-started-with-accessibility-features-tan426c48bdc/visionos">several Accessibility features</a> that can help.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="more_help">More Help</h2><br/>
Apple says that if the fit tips do not help, that users should visit a local <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> to get help. It is important to do this quickly because the exchange process must begin within 14 days of receiving the Vision Pro and accessories.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-fit/">Vision Pro Not Fitting Well?

<br/>

Developers can request a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/events/view/upcoming-events?q=Request%20a%20consultation%20about%20the%20changes%20to%20apps%20distributed%20in%20the%20European%20Union">30-minute online consultation</a> to ask questions and provide feedback about Apple's changes. Topics of discussion include alternative distribution on iOS, alternative payments in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, linking out to purchases on a webpage, new business terms, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also offering in-person labs in Cork, Ireland for those who are interested in starting an alternative app marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">making sweeping changes</a> to the app ecosystem in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act.

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of the Vision Pro, Apple published plenty of support documents and tutorials, including an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117741">overview of the gestures</a> used to control the headset. Most people have found the gesture-based control to be intuitive, but for those having difficulty, Apple also has some tips on getting the best experience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-vision-pro-gestures.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934311" /><br/>
<h2 id="vision_pro_gestures">Vision Pro Gestures</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Tap Fingers Together</strong> - To select an item on the Vision Pro, look at it and then tap your thumb and index finger together. Apple says this is the equivalent of tapping something on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or clicking something on the Mac.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Pinch and Drag</strong> - Moving items on Vision Pro can be done by looking at an item and then pinching your thumb and index finger together. Pinch and hold while moving the item, and then let go. Pinching and dragging is used for arranging apps, resizing windows, scrolling, and dragging things from one app to another.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Pinch and Flick</strong> - Scrolling through content quickly can be done by pinching your thumb and index finger together and then flicking the wrist up or down in a smooth motion. This gesture is used for moving horizontally through apps in the Home View, scrolling long web pages, and browsing images in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Pinch for Options</strong> - If you pinch and hold on an item in Vision Pro, you can bring up a list of items. Just look at an item, tap your thumb and index finger together, and hold. Once the options appear, you can let go and then tap to select the preferred option.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Touch</strong> - There are elements in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> that can be interacted with directly with the fingers. The virtual keyboard is one such example, as typing can be done by touching on the keys with one finger on each hand.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="gesture_tips">Gesture Tips</h2><br/>
For the best experience with Vision Pro, Apple recommends using it in a well-lit room, without long sleeves or large jewelry, and with your hands visible.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Make sure to use Vision Pro in a well-lit area and ensure that the front of the device is clean and free of smudges so that the outward-facing cameras can see your hands.</li><br/>
 <li>Keep your hands resting comfortably in your lap - there is no need to hold your arm up.</li><br/>
 <li>Make sure your hands are visible and not hidden under a desk or blanket.</li><br/>
 <li>Gloves, long sleeves, and large jewelry that covers a significant part or all of the hand can interfere with Vision Pro gesture tracking.</li><br/>
 <li>Don't cross your hands or cover up your gesturing hand with your other hand.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
There are also a range of Accessibility features that can be used for improving the Vision Pro experience in certain cases, with details available on <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/get-started-with-accessibility-features-tan426c48bdc/visionos">Apple's support website</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-gestures/">These Are the Gestures Used to Control Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-are-the-gestures-used-to-control-vision-pro.2418231/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple designed the Vision Pro to use a "Persona" or a digital representation of the wearer in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, Zoom, and other video apps. Apple says that the Persona is meant to be a "dynamic, natural representation" of the user's face, but many people have found it to be anything but natural.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/dan-persona-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934314" /><br/>
In fact, many reviewers found the Personas to be creepy, weird, and off-putting because of the uncanny valley experience, and that may be why Apple has only released Personas in a beta capacity. Apple today provided instructions on setting up a Persona, complete with tips on how to get the best result.<br/>
<br/>
You can watch <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan set up a Persona below, but it's basically as simple as tapping on Persona in Settings and following the instructions. Making a Persona uses the Vision Pro's camera and captures the user's face and facial expressions.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Cnvhrc5UEY" title="Apple Vision Pro: Unboxing &amp; Hands-On (It&#39;s INCREDIBLE)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Here's what Apple says Vision Pro owners can do to make the best Persona:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Take your time getting ready. Capture will not start until the Vision Pro is at eye level.</li><br/>
 <li>Use front-facing, even lighting. Do not have bright windows or lamps behind or beside you. The Vision Pro may prompt you to adjust lighting.</li><br/>
 <li>Ensure your face is well-lit with no strong shadows.</li><br/>
 <li>Make sure your hair is not covering your face.</li><br/>
 <li>Use a simple background and stay away from nearby objects like chair backs and lamps.</li><br/>
 <li>Make sure there are no people behind you.</li><br/>
 <li>Make sure the Vision Pro is held horizontally at eye level throughout the capture.</li><br/>
 <li>When asked to smile, make as large and natural a smile as you can.</li><br/>
 <li>If you're not able to perform one of the expressions, such as raising an eyebrow or smiling with teeth, double clicking on the Digital Crown will skip the expression.</li><br/>
 <li>Hats, earrings, AirPods, and other items might not be captured fully. They will need to be removed and the Persona will need to be redone if they don't look right.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
If your Persona does not come out as expected, you can redo the process and change variables until it looks better. Note that glasses cannot be captured, and must be added afterward through Apple's pre-selected styles.<br/>
<br/>
Different lighting options can be applied to a Persona, including Natural, Studio, or Contour. There are also settings to adjust the temperature and brightness of the Persona.<br/>
<br/>
When you capture your Persona, Apple is also capturing your eyes for the EyeSight feature that shows the wearer's eyes when other people are nearby.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-persona-tips/">Apple Provides Tips For Making Your Persona Look Better</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-provides-tips-for-making-your-persona-look-better.2418224/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Through its Developer website, Apple is offering a &#36;300 "Developer Strap" for the Vision Pro, which provides a USB-C connection between the headset and a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-developer-strap.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1404" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934307" /><br/>
Apple says that the Developer Strap is helpful for "accelerating the development of graphics-intensive apps and games." It is designed to provide the same audio experience as the standard Right Audio Strap, so it can be used for both development and testing.<br/>
<br/>
As noted by <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/02/vision-pro-developer-strap"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a>, the Developer Strap is only available to developers who are logged in to a paid U.S. Apple Developer account.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> today sent out a memo to employees, thanking them for their work on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset that was introduced today. In the memo, which was shared by <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-02/apple-fans-line-up-for-headset-as-spatial-computing-era-begins">Bloomberg</a></em>, Cook compared the Vision Pro to the Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Apple Watch, and said that it is joining Apple's "pantheon of groundbreaking products" that have both "defined Apple" and "redefined technology as we know it."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" /><br/>
Cook visited <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> Fifth Avenue in New York for the Vision Pro launch, and he said it was "incredible" to watch people try out the Vision Pro for the first time and see the "impossible become possible."<br/>
<br/>
According to Cook, this is "just the beginning" of spatial computing and the impact that Apple will make with the Vision Pro. Apple believes that "incredible opportunities" are still ahead.<br/>
<blockquote>Today we launched Apple Vision Pro, introducing an entirely new era of spatial computing. Moments like this should make us all pause -- to celebrate what we've achieved and reflect on the amazing potential that still lies ahead.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I was with our team at Apple Fifth Avenue, where the excitement for this moment was palpable. It's an incredible thing to watch people experience Apple Vision Pro for the very first time. The impossible becomes possible right before their eyes, and often they don't have the words to describe the experience. It really is a technology you have to see -- and see through -- to believe. And it was truly a gift to hear customers share their amazement, their emotion, and their dreams for this incredible device we've created. The whole experience reaffirmed the magnitude of this moment, as well as our Retail teams' vital role in delivering this unprecedented technology to the world.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Vision Pro brings together thousands of innovations to create a product that's like nothing the world has ever seen before. It's an extraordinary achievement, and as so many of you can attest, it has been years in the making. Apple Vision Pro is a reality thanks to you -- thanks to your commitment, your passion, and your contributions to the special culture that drives innovation at Apple. I especially want to thank all of the teams that have been dedicated to this project, who poured in countless hours over many years to yet again push the boundaries of what is possible.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, for us, the most important thing about Apple Vision Pro is how it enriches our customers' lives -- strengthening connection, unlocking potential, and empowering people to accomplish things that simply wouldn't be possible any other way. It's profoundly moving to think of people reliving their most treasured memories, or even introducing a loved one to a relative they never had the chance to meet. It's exhilarating to imagine the unbelievable new entertainment experiences our customers will discover, and the innovative apps our amazing developers will create. It's exciting to think of everything this unlocks for industries the world over, and of the incredible opportunities that still lie ahead. Because with spatial computing, this is just the beginning of the impact we can make.<br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Mac, a revolutionary device that transformed the world and laid the foundation for decades of innovation. When we shared iPod with the world, we put a thousand songs in our customers' pockets overnight. I remember the day we launched iPhone. We knew we had something special, but none of us could have foreseen its profound impact on our everyday lives. Then came iPad, a magical sheet of glass that becomes anything you want it to be, fostering new forms of connection and creativity for millions of people. With Apple Watch, there isn't a day that goes by I don't get a note from a user about its lifesaving impact. And now with today's launch, Apple Vision Pro joins the pantheon of groundbreaking products that have defined Apple and redefined technology as we know it.<br/>
<br/>
It's not every day we have a moment like this one. Thank you for all you've done to make it possible.</blockquote><br/>
Cook also did a quick interview with Good Morning America this morning, where he further explained the impact he thinks the Vision Pro will have. "The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; introduced us to mobile computing, the Mac introduced us to personal computing, this is the first spatial computer," he said. "People are going to interact with it in different ways."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Tim Cook talks new Apple Vision Pro" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fd5wv3hrd3s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
"A company only has a few of these," Cook continued. "Most companies have none. We've had the Mac, the iPod, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, the Apple Watch, and now the Vision Pro. It's one of those moments."<br/>
<br/>
On the price, Cook went on to explain that it's "tomorrow's technology today," and that it's packed with 5,000 patents. "We think we priced it for the right value today," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; is available at U.S. Apple Stores as of today, and some retail locations do have stock available for walk-in purchases. The device is priced starting at &#36;3,500.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/tim-cook-on-vision-pro-moment/">Apple CEO Tim Cook Compares Vision Pro &#039;Moment&#039; to iPhone and Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-compares-vision-pro-moment-to-iphone-and-mac.2418214/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Back in June, Apple published its "Platform State Of The Union" video for developers, and multiple times throughout that video, a Vision Pro with a mysterious USB-C adapter could be seen, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/09/vision-pro-usb-c-adapter/">leading to speculation as to what it could be</a>. <br/>
<br/>
A recent update to one of Apple's diagnostic tools has shed new light on this by providing a new look at the "developer strap" which was first referenced in iOS 17.0 developer beta 1. The tool, which has a model number of A2776, is designed for use by Apple retail stores when interfacing with a malfunctioning Vision Pro. Interestingly, developers who received the Vision Pro developer kit last year were also provided access to this strap.<br/>
<br/>
Code from the diagnostic tools also reveals more information on steps Apple retail stores can take to enter diagnostics mode on a malfunctioning Vision Pro to perform a restore: <br/>
<br/>
<ol><li>Remove the right audio strap and install the developer strap onto the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>.</li><br/>
<li>Start up the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; to Diagnostics Mode.<br/>
     â€“ Press and hold down the Digital Crown.<br/>
     â€“Â Attach the battery cable while holding the Digital Crown.<br/>
     â€“ Continue holding the Digital Crown for 8 to 10 seconds until the Apple logo appears.</li><br/>
<li>Plug the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; into this computer using a USB-C cable.</li></ol><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's first major new product category in almost a decade launched today, with the Vision Pro now in the hands of consumers in the United States. We picked up a Vision Pro this morning, and spent the day testing it out and filming our first impressions.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Cnvhrc5UEY" title="Apple Vision Pro: Unboxing &amp; Hands-On (It&#39;s INCREDIBLE)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Fit appointments at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> are useful because we've already heard of several situations where the initial &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; readings were off in terms of fit. If you're experiencing an issue with light leakage or comfort, Apple employees can get you a new Light Seal or help you adjust the straps to get the headset working the right way.<br/>
<br/>
At over 1.3 pounds, the Vision Pro is undeniably heavy, but the weight is distributed well with the right fit. It can get heavy to wear over time, but you'll mostly notice the weight when you take it off and feel the relief of not having 1.3 pounds on your face. We've had some light leaking in around the nose even with a solid fit, but the displays seem to work well enough even with that little bit of light.<br/>
<br/>
Putting on the Vision Pro for the first time is absolutely a "holy crap" moment because it's such a different experience, especially with the demo that &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; employees provide. The immersive content is mind blowing, especially when digging in to your own panoramas and spatial videos.<br/>
<br/>
Navigation is intuitive for the most part, but the virtual keyboard is kind of a miss. You can enter text one character at a time and that's fine, but you're going to want a Bluetooth keyboard for any extensive writing. Poking at the keyboard to type feels the most natural, but you can also look at the letters and pinch.<br/>
<br/>
The built-in speakers are great and do an awesome job with spatial audio, but be warned that people around you can hear what's going on so you might want to wear AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
Anything you're seeing in the real world is being relayed through passthrough cameras, so if you're not in the best lighting, you're not going to have the best view. Passthrough video quality can be hit or miss for this reason.<br/>
<br/>
Have you had a chance to try out the Vision Pro? Let us know in the comments below. Apple's retail stores are holding demos all weekend long, and starting Monday, you can book an appointment to get a demonstration if you don't have a Vision Pro yourself.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/vision-pro-unboxing/">Hands-On With the Apple Vision Pro: Unboxing, Initial Thoughts and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-the-apple-vision-pro-unboxing-initial-thoughts-and-more.2418206/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/">with GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 256GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> from GRID Studio. If you're not familiar with GRID Studio, it is a company <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/collections/all">that makes art</a> out of old, discarded Apple products, saving them from landfills.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Grid-1st-gen.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934263" /><br/>
GRID Studio takes vintage devices and disassembles them, laying out each component in a careful arrangement that is augmented with interesting facts and details about a device. The result is artwork that reflects a part of Apple's history, making GRID's products the perfect gift for an Apple enthusiast.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Grid-1st-gen_02.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934264" /><br/>
The GRID 1, for example, features <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">Apple's first ever iPhone</a>, and it is perhaps the most important device in Apple's history. The &#36;399 GRID 1 has all of the components from the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, ranging from the curved aluminum shell to the 2-megapixel rear camera components.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; came well before A-series chips, so the GRID 1 includes the main board with the Samsung CPU and PowerVR GPU that Apple used for the device, as well as the 30-pin connector used for charging at the time and the Home Button, which was just a button in the days before <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>. Each component is labeled and laid out logically, making for an interesting exploration into Apple's first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Grid-1st-gen_01.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934265" /><br/>
GRID even includes a diagram of what the first version of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s software looked like, with classic apps like Calculator, Text, Phone, Mail, Safari, and YouTube, along with a classic quote from Steve Jobs.<br/>
<br/>
As time goes on, the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is harder to find, so this is one of GRID's rarer pieces. The company says that there are very limited quantities of the GRID 1 left due to the difficulty of sourcing the first-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. It is worth noting that some of the devices used may have minor scuffs and scratches due to the fact that GRID is using vintage hardware.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Grid-1st-gen_03.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934267" /><br/>
The GRID 1 measures in at 13x13x1.8 inches, and it has a simple black frame that allows it to fit in anywhere in the home. The GRID 1 and other GRID pieces can be <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">purchased from the GRID Studio website</a>.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[If you buy a shiny new Vision Pro, be extra careful not to lose it. Unlike the iPhone and many other Apple devices, the headset lacks Find My location tracking.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Travel-Mode.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930973" /><br/>
In a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214043">support document</a>, Apple has confirmed that a Vision Pro's location cannot be viewed in the Find My app on another Apple device, or on iCloud.com. Of the Find My family of features, the Vision Pro only supports Activation Lock, which ensures that a thief cannot erase or freshly set up the headset unless they know the owner's Apple ID and password.<br/>
<br/>
"When you turn on Find My, you protect your Vision Pro with Activation Lock â€” but you can't use another Apple device or the web to find Vision Pro on a map, play a sound to help find it, turn on Lost Mode, or remotely erase it," says Apple.<br/>
<br/>
While it's nice to know that a thief cannot easily erase your Vision Pro and set it up with their own Apple ID, the inability to track its location in the Find My app is a noteworthy omission for a headset that starts at &#36;3,499. It ultimately means that if you lose your Vision Pro, you could be simply out of luck beyond filing a police report. Unlike for the iPhone, there is no AppleCare+ theft and loss plan available for the Vision Pro at this time.<br/>
<br/>
While many people will primarily use the Vision Pro at home as an entertainment device, which will greatly reduce the risk of the headset being stolen, Apple does promote using the Vision Pro on an airplane and other settings away from home. The headset could be especially attractive to thieves given how expensive it is.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear why the Vision Pro does not support Find My location tracking, but the headset lacking a built-in battery and GPS could be contributing factors.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Use an AirTag</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-case-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931669" /><br/>
One option for tracking the location of your Vision Pro is to purchase <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-releases-vision-pro-accessories/">Apple's travel case</a> and place an AirTag in it, and it is likely that accessory makers will come up with solutions for attaching an AirTag directly to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro owners can also ensure that Activation Lock is turned on by opening the Settings app, selecting Find My, and selecting Find My Vision Pro.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-lacks-find-my-tracking/">Don&#039;t Lose Your &#36;3,500 Apple Vision Pro, You Can&#039;t Track Its Location</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-lose-your-3-500-apple-vision-pro-you-cant-track-its-location.2418198/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
