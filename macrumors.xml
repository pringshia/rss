		<description><![CDATA[Apple will report its earnings results for the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-q4-2023-earnings-results-date/">on Thursday, November 2</a> at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the results on a conference call with analysts a half hour later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Keep reading for some key things to know about the quarter, including a recap of new products announced, revenue expectations, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Products During Quarter</h2><br/>
The quarter ran from ran from July 2 through September 30, according to Apple's fiscal calendar, and included the following product launches:<ul><li>iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max</li><br/>
<li>Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2</li><br/>
<li>AirPods Pro with USB-C charging case and EarPods with USB-C connector</li></ul><h2>Revenue Expectations</h2><br/>
Apple has not provided formal revenue guidance since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Wall Street expects the company to report revenue of &#36;89.28 billion in the fourth quarter, according <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/01/apple-q4-2023-earnings-preview-fourth-consecutive-sales-decline-expected.html">to <em>CNBC</em></a>. This would be around a 1% decline compared to the &#36;90.15 billion revenue the company reported in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Maestri provided the following commentary on Apple's earnings call last quarter:<blockquote>We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.</blockquote><h2>Conference Call</h2><br/>
Cook and Maestri will hold a conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Thursday to discuss the company's fourth quarter earnings results. The call should last around one hour and will include a Q&A segment with analysts.<br/>

		<title>Have a 13-Inch MacBook Pro? Here&#039;s Why You Should Upgrade to the New M3 14-Inch Model</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week discontinued the 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> MacBook Pro, replacing it with a 14-inch model that's equipped with a next-generation M3 chip. The 14-inch model is more expensive, but it comes with a number of benefits that make it worth the upgrade for anyone with a 13-inch machine. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3mBLetnQpk" title="Apple M3 14-Inch MacBook Pro vs M2 13-Inch MacBook Pro: Worth the Upgrade?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro has a larger display than the 13-inch model for more screen real estate, and it features much more modern-looking thin bezels. There's also a notch that houses the front-facing camera, a necessity for those slimmed down bezels. It is a mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR display, which is an upgrade over the LCD of the prior-generation 13-inch model. <br/>
<br/>
Along with support for 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, the 14-inch MacBook Pro's display is brighter and has better color and HDR support. SDR brightness is 600 nits, while XDR brightness is 1000 nits sustained and 1600 nits peak.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of performance, you're going to see a boost in CPU and GPU speeds, but it will be most noticeable if you're coming from an Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip or an even earlier Intel chip. The M3 has an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU much like the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, but the GPU supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing so gameplay will be improved.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life has seen a boost, so the 14-inch MacBook Pro now lasts for up to 22 hours, up two hours from the 20 hour battery life of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you were a fan of the Touch Bar, be warned that the 14-inch MacBook Pro does not have one. With the discontinuation of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has officially nixed the Touch Bar. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of size, the 14-inch MacBook Pro is a little wider, a little longer, and just a bit heavier than the 13-inch model. It weighs 3.4 pounds while the 13-inch model weighed 3 pounds. There are more ports with the M3 MacBook Pro, so in addition to two Thunderbolt ports, you'll also get an HDMI port, an SD card slot, an HDMI port, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charging port. <br/>
<br/>
Other improvements include a better 1080p <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> HD camera, a six-speaker sound system, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3. <br/>
<br/>
The only real downside with the 14-inch MacBook Pro is the price. It starts at &#36;1,599, making it &#36;300 more expensive than the &#36;1,299 starting price of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you can afford it, what you get for the extra &#36;300 is worth it, but if that makes it too pricey, you'll need to look at the lower-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. <br/>
<br/>
For those with an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro, it's probably not worth upgrading to the 14-inch model right now despite the benefits, but if you're coming from an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro or an Intel machine, it's going to be a much more notable upgrade that will feel closer to night and day.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The lower-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music-voice-plan/">Apple Music Voice Plan</a> was discontinued today, with references to the plan removed from Apple's website in all countries where it was available. <a href="https://macmagazine.com.br/post/2023/11/01/silenciosamente-apple-mata-assinatura-voice-do-apple-music/">Brazilian website <em>MacMagazine</em></a> was first to alert us to this news.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/apple-music-voice-plan-feature-blue-green.jpg" alt="" width="1812" height="1020" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-830419" /><br/>
Priced at &#36;4.99 per month in the U.S., the Voice Plan was designed to let users access Apple Music exclusively through Siri. The plan launched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/14/ios-15-2-apple-music-voice-plan-video/">as part of iOS 15.2</a> in December 2021 in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, and the U.K.<br/>
<br/>
The primary way to subscribe to the Voice Plan was by asking Siri, and music playback was controlled via Siri too. While the plan provided access to the entire Apple Music catalog with over 100 million songs, it lacked some features available on more expensive plans, such as downloading, spatial audio, and Family Sharing.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear why the Voice Plan was discontinued, or if existing subscribers to this plan will be able to continue using the plan indefinitely. We've reached out to Apple for comment and we'll update this story if we receive a response.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/apple-music-voice-plan-no-longer-available/">Apple Music&#039;s Lower-Priced Voice Plan No Longer Available</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-musics-lower-priced-voice-plan-no-longer-available.2409543/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Customers who purchase one of the new M3, M3 Pro, or M3 Max MacBook Pro or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> models will need to install a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> update after receiving their machines.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919851" /><br/>
The Macs will ship with a custom version of &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.1 with a build number of 23B2073, but new users will need to download and install a new version with a build number of 23B2077.<br/>
<br/>
Day one updates are not unusual for new devices as Apple often has to begin manufacturing with an older version of the software.

		<description><![CDATA[Introductory production on the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 will start in India in the second half of 2025, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/iphone印度生產狀況更新-iphone-17-npi可能將在印度啟動-update-on-iphone-production-in-india-iphone-17-npi-likely-4088fb656708">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo says that new product introduction (NPI) for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 will happen in India, marking the first time that Apple begins development of a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; outside of China.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/apple-india.jpg" alt="" width="2304" height="1296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756076" /><br/>
Apple will opt to assemble the standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 in India because it has a "lower difficulty" design that will minimize risk. Apple has been manufacturing older iPhones and other devices in India since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/02/apple-iphone-manufacturing-india-official/">for several years now</a> in an effort to move more of its manufacturing out of China. Apple has slowly started giving factories in India <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/26/apple-manufacturing-iphone-14-india/">more responsibility</a>, and began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> production in the country just a few weeks after the device launched in September 2022. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> production started even earlier, with factories in the country assembling the base &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/new-iphone-starts-production-outside-china/">prior to launch</a>, but assembly still started in China first.<br/>
<br/>
Apple works with Foxconn, Pegatron, and Tata (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tata-make-iphones-india-after-buying-wistron-business-2023-10-27/">new owner of Wistron</a>) to manufacture iPhones in India, with Foxconn handling 75 to 80 percent of the device assembly. Foxconn has invested more than &#36;500 million in India to ramp up its manufacturing capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
As of now, Kuo believes that 12 to 14 percent of global &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; shipments are made in India, with that proportion to increase to 20 to 25 percent by 2024. In addition to allowing Apple to move manufacturing away from China, increasing production in India provides Apple with an opportunity to strengthen its relationship with the Indian government. India is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/08/apple-india-focus-international-sales/">key market for Apple</a> due to growing demand for Apple products in the country.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in 2023 opened its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/apple-stores-india-wallpapers/">first retail stores in Mumbai</a>, but online sales have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/23/apple-online-store-india-launch/">available in India</a> since 2020.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/iphone-17-assembly-india/">iPhone 17 to Be Assembled in India as Apple Aims to Further Diversify Supply Chain</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-to-be-assembled-in-india-as-apple-aims-to-further-diversify-supply-chain.2409529/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> that Apple unveiled in October is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/the-new-more-affordable-apple-pencil-is-now-available-to-order/">available for purchase starting today</a>. Priced at &#36;79, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is compatible with all iPads that feature a USB-C port, and it serves as an alternative to the more expensive first and second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917176" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; features a matte finish and a flat magnetic side to allow it to attach to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> when not in use, plus there is a hidden USB-C port under the sliding cap for charging purposes. Unlike the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2, it is not able to charge magnetically when attached to an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and it is also lacking pressure sensitivity and support for tap gestures. <br/>
<br/>
Other &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; features such as low latency and tilt sensitivity are included, plus it supports the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Hover feature on compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; can be <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUWA3AM/A/apple-pencil-usb-c">purchased from the online Apple Store </a>in more than 30 countries, including the United States.

		<description><![CDATA[A legal claim in the United Kingdom over Apple's 2017 "throttling" controversy has been allowed to move forward by the Competition Appeal Tribunal, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/mass-lawsuit-against-apple-over-iphone-batteries-can-go-ahead-london-tribunal-2023-11-01/">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-slow-16x9-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1314" height="740" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920127" /><br/>
Consumer advocate Justin Gutmann <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/16/uk-legal-claim-25-million-users-battery-throttling/">filed the claim back in June 2022,</a> originally seeking a total of £750 million for up to 25 million <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the UK whose devices were affected by the issue, which stemmed from Apple's efforts to prevent devices with degraded batteries from unexpectedly shutting down while in use. The claim has since ballooned to as much at £1.6 billion plus interest.<blockquote>Gutmann's lawyers had argued Apple concealed issues with batteries in certain phone models and "surreptitiously" installed a power management tool which limited performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple, however, said the lawsuit is "baseless" and that it strongly denies batteries in iPhones were defective, apart from in a small number of iPhone 6s models for which it offered free battery replacements.</blockquote>Gutmann's claim covers &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 through &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X models, and while the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled the claim can move forward, it also highlighted "a lack of clarity and specificity" that will need to be resolved before it can actually proceed to trial.<br/>
<br/>
Apple deployed power management features with iOS 10.2.1 in 2017 that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/">throttled performance</a> to prevent devices with degraded batteries from attempting to draw peak power the batteries could no longer provide. Apple says it introduced the features to help extend device lifespan while minimizing disruptive device shutdowns, but the company was criticized by some customers for not disclosing what it was doing amid suggestions it was attempting to hide defective devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/">apologized</a> for not better explaining the changes it made and why it did so, and introduced a low-cost battery replacement program that lasted for several years.<br/>
<br/>
In 2020, Apple agreed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/02/apple-agrees-to-up-to-500m-batterygate-settlement/">pay up to &#36;500 million</a> to settle a long-running class action lawsuit in the United States over the issue, and the company has faced similar lawsuits in a number of other countries.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/">iPhone Slowdown</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/uk-lawsuit-throttled-iphones-moves-forward/">UK Lawsuit Over &#039;Throttled&#039; iPhones Moves Forward</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-lawsuit-over-throttled-iphones-moves-forward.2409517/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first benchmark results for the standard M3 chip surfaced <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=mac15%2C3">in the Geekbench 6 database</a> today, providing a closer look at the chip's CPU performance improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
Based on the results so far, the M3 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 3,000 and 11,700, respectively. The standard M2 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 2,600 and 9,700, respectively, so the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip, as Apple claimed during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">"Scary Fast" event</a> on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench 6 multi-core scores:<ul><li><strong>M3 chip:</strong> ~11,700 (+20% vs. M2 chip)</li><br/>
<li><strong>M2 chip:</strong> ~9,700 (+17% vs. M1 chip)</li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 chip:</strong> ~8,315</li></ul>It's unclear if the results are for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro or iMac, both of which are available with the standard M3 chip, but performance should be similar for both machines. The results have a "Mac15,3" identifier, which <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-14/apple-ramps-up-testing-of-new-macbooks-ahead-of-summer-launch">reported</a> was for a laptop with the same display resolution as a 14-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The standard M3 chip is equipped with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, and it supports up to 24GB of unified memory. The chip has improved GPU architecture with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, which will make high-end games look more realistic. It also has a 16-core Neural Engine for AI.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has refreshed the MacBook Pro's hardware with a full set of M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, but what exactly do the latest machines bring to the table and is it worth upgrading from the previous generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/MacBook-Pro-2021-2023-and-2023-Buyers-Guide-Feature-1.875.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920052" /><br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip starts at &#36;1,599, replacing the previous <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> 13-inch model as the entry-level machine in Apple's pro notebook lineup. Equipped with the higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, the 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,999 and the 16-inch model starts at &#36;2,499.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the launch of the latest models, previous-generation MacBook Pro models have been discontinued and are no longer available from Apple's main storefront. Units of slightly older machines such as the 2021 and early 2023 models may, however, still be available via Apple's refurbished store and third-party retailers for significantly reduced prices. Buying a 2021 or early 2023 model second-hand is also an option.<br/>
<br/>
First-time MacBook Pro‌ customers or those upgrading from a much older device may be wondering whether it is worth buying a 2021 or early 2023 model, so it will be important to weigh up exactly what was added with the latest version. Likewise, existing users of the 2021 or early 2023 MacBook Pro may be wondering if it is worth upgrading to the latest model or sticking with their current device.<br/>
<br/>
See the detailed breakdown below for each new feature, change, and improvement that was added with the late 2023's ‌14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models compared to their predecessors:<br/>

<br/>
The late 2023 MacBook Pro models are relatively minor improvements over their direct predecessors that primarily focus on performance improvements. Beyond their chips, the early 2023 MacBook Pro introduced support for Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1, and added an extra hour of battery life. The late 2023 MacBook Pro added an extra 100 nits of SDR brightness, AV1 decode, and a Space Black color option. Accumulatively, this makes for quite a small upgrade for existing users of the 2021 MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing which 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro model to buy ultimately comes down to what level of performance you require. For example, the M3 series of chips feature a redesigned GPU with hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, which may be an attractive upgrade for some users, but it is far from essential for the vast majority. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro users who are mulling an upgrade to an M3 Pro machine should also be aware that it features reduced memory bandwidth and one less GPU core. <br/>
<br/>
Generally, unless you need peak performance for demanding professional workflows, it will not be worth upgrading from a 2021 MacBook Pro to a 2023 model, or from an early 2023 machine to a late 2023 model. Only those who need the M3's redesigned GPU and hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, or more than 12 CPU cores, 38 GPU cores, or 96GB memory will really benefit.<br/>
<br/>

For those who have not yet made the leap to an Apple silicon machine, the 2021 and early 2023 MacBook Pro models are still very good options if you can get them for a significantly low price. It is only worth paying more to get the latest model if you want a future-proof device to keep for the long term, where slightly better performance, battery life, and specifications like Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1 are likely to be more beneficial through successive software updates and as connectivity needs with other devices evolve. Even then, it is difficult to recommend buying a late 2023 MacBook Pro at full price over an equivalent, heavily discounted early 2023 model.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you are considering upgrading across the product lineup, such as going from a 2021 or early 2023 14-inch MacBook Pro to a 16-inch model, it may be worth buying the latest model to capture its handful of other improvements.<br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip effectively replaces the previous 13-inch MacBook Pro, which featured the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip in 2020 and the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in 2022. For users of these older MacBook Pro models, the new low-cost 14-inch model represents a substantial upgrade, featuring a larger display with a mini-LED panel, a 1080p camera, a six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers, an HDMI 2.1 port and an SDXC card slot, fast charging and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> 3, and two extra hours of battery life.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-pro-upgraders-buyers-guide/">2023 MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 20+ Differences Compared Across Generations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2023-macbook-pro-buyers-guide-20-differences-compared-across-generations.2377515/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to add blood pressure monitoring and sleep apnea detection to an Apple Watch with an updated design in 2024, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-11-01/apple-health-blood-pressure-glucose-sleep-apnea-team-issues">report</a> covering the arc of Apple's heath-related ambitions, Gurman outlines the first iteration of the company's "pathbreaking" blood pressure sensor technology coming next year that will include hypertension detection:<br/>
<blockquote>The system is designed to just tell a user if their blood pressure is trending upward and to offer a journal for the user to jot down what was happening when hypertension occurred. To avoid potentially giving a misdiagnosis, the feature will then direct a user to talk to their doctor or check their blood pressure with a traditional cuff, which can provide exact systolic and diastolic measurements. </blockquote>A future version of the system in development can provide exact numbers and even diagnose related conditions, according to Gurman. However, these enhancements "remain far off," he adds.<br/>
<br/>
Also coming in 2024 is an Apple Watch-based sleep apnea detection feature. According to the report, it will use sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition, and then direct users to see a physician.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-watch-blood-glucose-up-to-seven-years-away/">previously reported</a>, Apple is also working on non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. Apple's system is said to use a silicon photonics chip to shine light from a laser under the skin to determine the concentration of glucose in the body.<br/>
<br/>
The glucose monitoring has been designed in a similar way to the blood pressure system, in that it currently monitors how a person's blood sugar is trending and warns users of pre-diabetes, rather than offer an actual blood sugar reading.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple's blood glucose monitoring efforts remain unlikely to show up in a product for "at least a few years," according to Gurman's latest report, citing people with knowledge of the efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Away from Apple Watch, Apple is also said to be on course to bring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/12/gurman-airpods-to-gain-hearing-health-features/">hearing aid detection</a> to AirPods in 2024. Equipped with the new feature, AirPods will be able to function as an over-the-counter hearing aid and be able to perform the hearing tests typically administered in audiologists' offices.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Apple is said to be continuing to explore ways to make the upcoming Apple Vision Pro headset into a health device, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-explores-vision-pro-health-capabilities/">reported previously</a> by <em>The Information</em>. Anti-anxiety and enhanced meditation features are being worked on, as well as a virtual-reality system to reinforce positive thinking and improve mental health.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also been studying using the sensors in the device to scan a wearer's eyes for cognitive health data, while a headset version of Fitness+ "remains on the table," according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>Bloomberg</em> report additionally includes some interesting backstory on Apple's evolving health and healthcare initiatives in recent years, as well as an update on the company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/apple-primary-healthcare-service-wsj/">paid health coaching service in development</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has launched Tap to Pay on iPhone in Ukraine, allowing independent sellers, small merchants, and large retailers in the country to use ‌iPhones‌ as a payment terminal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/tap-to-pay-ukraine.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920037" /><br/>
Ukraine becomes the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tap-to-pay/#regions">seventh region</a> to support Tap to Pay, following similar rollouts in the U.K., Australia, Taiwan, Brazil, and the Netherlands earlier in the year.<br/>
<br/>
The feature was introduced in the United States in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/08/apple-announces-tap-to-pay-iphone-feature/">February 2022</a>, and allows compatible iPhones to accept payments via Apple Pay, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets, using only an ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌ - no additional hardware or credit card machine is required‌.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://en.privatbank.ua/news/2023/10/31/2067">PrivatBank</a> is the first payment platform to offer Tap to Pay on ‌iPhone‌ to its Ukraine-based business customers. Apple's system‌‌‌‌ uses NFC technology to securely authenticate the contactless payments, plus the feature also supports PIN entry, which includes accessibility options.<br/>
<blockquote>"We are delighted to launch Tap to Pay on iPhone for entrepreneurs and businesses in Ukraine and to be providing this simple and secure solution that offers greater flexibility for accepting payments for businesses of all sizes, from street vendors to large retailers," said Gerhard Boesch, chairman of the board of PrivatBank. "As a state-owned bank with the largest share of small and medium-sized businesses, we feel a great responsibility to support businesses to scale – and save – with fast, in-person payment solutions."</blockquote>Tap to Pay on ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌ requires ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌ XS or newer models, and works for customers as any normal ‌‌‌‌Apple Pay‌‌‌‌ transaction would. Sellers just need to open up the app, register the sale, and present their ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌ to the buyer, who can then use an appropriate contactless payment method.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple announced three new devices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">during its "Scary Fast" event</a> on Monday, including updated 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac models, all with M3 series chips. Apple did not announce any other products during the 30-minute event, which was likely the company's final presentation this year.<br/>
<br/>

Below, our latest rumor report card provides a look at which rumors were right and wrong or a mix of both following Apple's event.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Accurate</h2><ul><li><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple would likely hold a Mac launch event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-mac-launch-event-coming-october-30-or-31/">on October 30 or October 31</a>.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman said the new 24-inch iMac would skip the M2 chip and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/next-gen-imac-details-rumored-ahead-of-event/">go right to the M3 chip</a>.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman revealed several accurate <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect">CPU core counts, GPU core counts, and RAM amounts</a> for the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips in the new MacBook Pro models.</li><br/>
<li>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-march-2024-launch/">both</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">ruled out new iPads</a> for the rest of 2023, and this event indeed lacked any iPad announcements.</li><br/>
<li>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/alleged-macbook-pro-box-image/">box for the new MacBook Pro leaked</a> on Chinese social media website Weibo.</li></ul><br/>
<h2>Inaccurate</h2><ul><li><em>MacRumors</em> discovered that an Apple supplier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/apple-scary-fast-event-battery-filings/">resubmitted a sixth-generation iPad mini battery filing</a> in a Chinese regulatory database last week, and speculated about the possibility of a seventh-generation iPad mini using the same battery being announced at the event, but this did not happen.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman reported that Apple would likely announce updated versions of the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad for the Mac <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">with USB-C ports for charging</a>, but the accessories are still equipped with Lightning.</li><br/>
<li>Japanese blog <em>Mac Otakara</em> believed that the next 24-inch iMac would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/imac-m2-and-m2-pro-rumor/">equipped with M2 and M2 Pro chips</a>, but it has the M3 chip.</li></ul><h2>Mixed</h2><ul><li>Kuo initially claimed that new MacBooks with M3 series chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">were unlikely to launch this year</a>, but he later reversed course and said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/">new MacBook Pro models with M3 series chips would be announced</a> at the event.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman initially claimed that new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models were on track to launch <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-15/apple-october-2023-executive-promotions-new-vps-of-retail-software-operations-lnrh4t94">in early to spring 2024</a>, but he later reversed course and said that the laptops would be announced at the event.</li><br/>
<li><em>MacRumors</em> published a report speculating that Apple's event would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-event-mac-gaming-focus-likely/">likely have an emphasis on high-end gaming on the Mac</a>. The new M3 series chips for the Mac do feature hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games, as the report mentioned, but the unconfirmed tip that we mentioned about the event having a Japanese developer tie-in was inaccurate.</li></ul><h2>Undetermined</h2><ul><li>Prior to the event, Kuo said the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">24-inch iMac would be updated in 2024</a>, but he did not explicitly rule out a new model in 2023.</li></ul><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/scary-fast-apple-event-rumor-report-card/">&#039;Scary Fast&#039; Rumor Report Card: New MacBook Pros and iMac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/scary-fast-rumor-report-card-new-macbook-pros-and-imac.2409441/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models may be equipped with an extra button, according to <a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Weibo leaker Instant Digital</a>, who has shared accurate details on Apple's plans in the past. Instant Digital claims that there is a "great chance" of getting an additional button, with Apple also planning to relocate the mmWave antenna to the left of the device instead of the right to accommodate the change.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro Action Button will supposedly sit flush with the device, as Apple is expected to transition to solid-state technology for the button rather than the current standard button design.<br/>
<br/>
Though changes are expected to the Action Button, the volume keys and the power keys are said to remain the same with no changes. These buttons are not solid-state at the current time, though Apple's plans could change.<br/>
<br/>
The information shared by Instant Digital echoes details that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/"><em>MacRumors</em> published in late September</a> highlighting the extra button that is expected to come to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. Apple is calling this button the "Capture Button" internally, but it continues to be unclear what exactly it will be used for. The button will be located under the power button on the right side of the device, and it will be a capacitive button rather than a standard button.<br/>
<br/>
We also previously outlined the repositioning of the mmWave antenna to the space under the volume buttons, and the adoption of solid-state technology for the Action Button. Our sources have indicated that the new button is set to be introduced on all &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, including the base &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Setsuna Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/">iPhone 16 Could Feature Extra Button, Relocated mmWave Antenna and Haptic Action Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-could-feature-extra-button-relocated-mmwave-antenna-and-haptic-action-button.2409439/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fifth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that runs on the Vision Pro headset. The fourth beta <a href="hhttps://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-releases-visionos-beta-4/">came out in early October</a>, so it has been nearly a month since Apple last released a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people do not have access to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta outside of Xcode, and it is not entirely clear what Apple is adding in each &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update. Apple has said that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> will be coming to &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; soon, and it appears that it may be present in this fifth beta. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It looks like visionOS Beta 5 has the App Store! <a href="https://t.co/RIL9u9sBQB">pic.twitter.com/RIL9u9sBQB</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1719457938740248708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple is letting developers attend Vision Pro labs around the world, and developers who visit these locations are able to test the Vision Pro in person and get help from Apple engineers on their &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is not expected until early 2024, so Apple still has several months to refine the hardware and software.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/apple-releases-visionos-beta-5/">Apple&#039;s Work on visionOS Continues With Beta 5 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-work-on-visionos-continues-with-beta-5-launch.2409431/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a new firmware update designed for the AirTag item trackers. The firmware features a build number of 2A61, up from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/12/apple-releases-airtags-firmware-update-2a36/">the 2A36 firmware</a> that came out last December.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813264" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/AitTag-New-Firmware.jpg" alt="" width="2390" height="1344" /><br/>
It has been nearly a year since Apple updated the firmware on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>, and there is no word yet on what might be included in the update.<br/>
<br/>
Today's firmware release will be rolling out on a staggered basis. One percent of users will get the update today, and then it will expand to 10 percent of users on November 7. On November 14, an additional 25 percent of users will see the update, and then it will be available to all on November 28.<br/>
<br/>
It is not possible to force an AirTag update, as it's something that's done over-the-air through a connected <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device. You can check your current AirTag firmware version through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> app, with instructions <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-airtags-firmware-version/">available in our how to</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232">AirTags</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/airtags-firmware-update/">Apple Releases New Firmware for AirTags</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-airtags.2409423/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">announced on Monday</a> are available <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-unveils-new-space-black-color-for-m3-pro-and-m3-max-macbook-pro/">in a new Space Black finish</a> when configured with M3 Pro or M3 Max chips. Notably, Apple says this finish features an "anodization seal" to "greatly reduce fingerprints."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Toms-Guide-Space-Black-MacBook-Pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919950" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Space Black MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-pro-16-inch-m3-2023">via Tom's Guide</a></em></div><br/>
Apple already made the MacBook Air available in a darker Midnight finish, and it is considered by many to be a fingerprint magnet. Based on hands-on videos of the new MacBook Pro models shared following Apple's event, the new anti-fingerprint seal does appear to be an improvement compared to the MacBook Air, but more testing is needed.<br/>
<br/>
In the hands-on video below, <em>The Verge</em>'s Dan Seifert said "I got like 30 seconds to touch the new Space Black model, and yeah, I guess there are fewer fingerprints on it, but we'll really have to see how it holds up in the real world."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUyKtOj3cks?si=Eeti2Ez1O_1XqrH2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/a-magic-number-new-macbook-pros-and-imacs-usher-in-the-m3-era/"><em>Six Colors</em> editor-in-chief Jason Snell said</a> the Space Black finish is "generally more resistant to fingerprints," but he said some fingerprints are still to be expected. He also said Space Black is more like a "dark gray" instead of actual black:<blockquote>I got my greasy monkey paws on a Space Black laptop and can report that Apple's as good as its word in the sense that it seems generally more resistant to fingerprints and other smudges.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't want to exaggerate this feature: you can still see fingerprints. They just aren't as prominent. This is a progressive improvement over something like the Midnight M2 MacBook Air, but it's not a cure-all.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, I need to warn you not to get too excited about Apple finally making a black MacBook Pro. Space Black is not actually as black as space. It's a dark gray. Yes, it's appreciably darker than the Space Gray on the current MacBook Pros (and the new base model), but it's still a shimmery metallic gray. Fans of Darth Vader stand down.</blockquote>Another hands-on video from Brian Tong:<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-RhNLERfLE?si=ebV-C8JDICR9rYrA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2023/10/30/apple-reveals-new-m3-chip-powered-macbook-pro-line/"><em>MobileSyrup</em>'s Patrick O'Rourke</a> said "I have very greasy fingers and spent several minutes in the hands-on area trying to smudge the 'Space Black' colour — I couldn't."<br/>

<a href="https://gizmodo.com/hands-on-with-the-apple-m3-macbook-pro-1850976095"><em>Gizmodo</em>'s Kyle Barr</a> said "I did have the chance to put my grubby hands on the newest M3-powered MacBook Pros, and while I didn't see many leftover smears on the surface, it didn't take long for Apple staff to swoop in with microfiber cloth in hand to remove any wayward stains," so testing will be needed outside of a controlled environment.<br/>

<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hands-on-apple-m3-macs/"><em>XDA</em>'s Brady Snyder</a> on Space Black and fingerprints:<blockquote>Though the changes to the M3 MacBook Pro were mostly internal, there's a new color called Space Black. It looks better in person than it did in Apple's unveiling, but it's still not black. I'd compare it to the black color of the iPhone 5 or the iPad mini 2. It's still nowhere near the black color we saw on the polycarbonate MacBooks in the mid-2000s. As you can see in the photos below, this MacBook can look lighter and darker based on lighting conditions, much like Apple's Midnight colorway. However, compared to that color, the MacBook Pro does seem to be less of a fingerprint magnet.</blockquote>The new MacBook Pro models are available to order now, and most configurations will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7. Configurations with the M3 Max chip launch later in November.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/">Space Black MacBook Pro With Anti-Fingerprint Seal Revealed in First Hands-On Videos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/space-black-macbook-pro-with-anti-fingerprint-seal-revealed-in-first-hands-on-videos.2409421/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
