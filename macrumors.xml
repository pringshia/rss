		<description><![CDATA[Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has criticized Apple's compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulation, which forces Apple to let third-party developers create alternative App Stores and use their own payment systems, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">amongst other things</a>.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Speaking to investors on Thursday during Meta's Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg called Apple's new rules "so onerous" that he would not be surprised if any developer adopted them.<br/>
<blockquote>"I don't think that the Apple thing is going to have any difference for us. Because I think that the way they have implemented it, I would be very surprised if any developer chose to go into the alternative app stores that they have. They've made it so onerous, and I think so at odds with the intent of what the EU regulation was, that I think it's just going to be very difficult for anyone, including ourselves, to really seriously entertain what they're doing there."</blockquote>The introduction of the EU's DMA regulations were designed to increase competition in the bloc's app economy by allowing other companies to host their own app stores and collect payments, without them being subjected to Apple's commission rates. However, Apple has introduced a new fee structure as part of the change, including a €0.50 "<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/">Core Technology Fee</a>" or CTF for every app install over one million installs, a model that could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-eu-fees-could-bankrupt-app-developers/">prohibitively expensive for free apps</a> like Meta's if they are distributed outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Meta's comments broadly align with several other big companies critical of Apple's proposed DMA changes, including Spotify, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, Mozilla, and Microsoft. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/spotify-on-apple-eu-app-changes/">Spotify CEO Daniel EK</a> called Apple's plan "a complete and total farce" under "the false pretense of compliance and concessions." <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/fortnite-returning-to-ios-in-europe/">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney</a>, another outspoken Apple critic, said that the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌ changes are a "devious new instance of malicious compliance" aimed at thwarting EU regulations. Microsoft <a href="https://twitter.com/bondsarah_bond/status/1752083596318593238">said</a> they are a "step in the wrong direction," while Mozilla said it was "extremely disappointed" and called the plans "another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true browser competition on iOS."   <br/>
<br/>
EU regulators say they intend to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/technology/apple-app-store-europe.html">study Apple's proposed plans</a> after March 7, when the DMA goes into effect.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/zuckerberg-criticizes-apple-dma-plans/">Zuckerberg Calls Apple&#039;s DMA Compliance Changes &#039;Onerous&#039; and &#039;Difficult to Seriously Entertain&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/zuckerberg-calls-apples-dma-compliance-changes-onerous-and-difficult-to-seriously-entertain.2418139/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Cultured Code</a> has officially released an all-new spatial computing version of Things 3, the popular personal task manager software, for Apple's Vision Pro headset, which launches today in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Things-3-for-Vision-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933502" /><br/>
Developed from the ground up to be a fully featured native app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the productivity app brings the familiar Things interface into the user's virtual workspace, allowing them to open multiple Things windows and arrange them around their immediate environment.<br/>
<br/>
The sidebar can be hidden to focus on a single list, or users can place it next to their other apps while they get things done. As you'd expect for a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; app, the Things interface can be navigated using eyes, hands, and voice. Available functions include the ability to search across lists, drag and drop to-dos, and dictate notes.<br/>
<br/>
The app also works with a wireless keyboard connection, offering full keyboard support, and Things for Vision Pro syncs with the app on Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and Apple Watch.<br/>

		<title>Apple to Launch Foldable As Early As 2026 That Could Ultimately Replace iPad Mini</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is considering launching its first foldable in the next few years in the form of a 7- to 8-inch device that could ultimately replace the 8.3-inch iPad mini.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPad-mini-6-orange-BG.jpg" alt="" width="1881" height="1058" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816576" /><br/>
That's the latest claim to come out of Korean outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25724">The Elec</a></em>. According to the report, Apple is reviewing a launch timeframe for the device between 2026 and 2027.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple is also actively developing an OLED iPad mini, so there remains uncertainty within Apple about the nature and specifications of the foldable. Speculation reportedly remains rife in the industry around whether it will be a foldable iPhone or foldable iPad model.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung Display and LG Display have reportedly already been sending samples of 7-inch and 8-inch foldable panels to Apple since last year.<br/>
<br/>
Among the panel companies, Samsung is said to be more active in developing Apple foldable panels than LG, and is the more likely primary supplier of a foldable panel if Apple decides on a 2026 release. <br/>
<br/>
Apple, Samsung Display, and LG Display are also said to have "different ideas" about the ultra-thin glass material, foldable panel cover window, and the hinge concept, which is at the core of the product's mechanism. These differences reportedly involve contrasting judgements concerning product durability and reliability.<br/>
<br/>
Once mass production is decided, Samsung is expected to create the foldable panel in the 6th generation A3 or A4 OLED line that it uses to make OLED panels for Apple's iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report, Apple is also working on a larger 20.5-inch foldable product that is expected to be released later than the 7- to 8-inch device. The larger foldable has been rumored before by both <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-20-inch-display-future-macbook-pro/">The Elec</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Bloomberg</a></em>, and Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/25/bigger-ipad-pro-could-be-foldable/">Ross Young</a>. Young has also previously said that he expects a foldable tablet-like device in 2026 or 2027.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/">Apple to Launch Foldable As Early As 2026 That Could Ultimately Replace iPad Mini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-foldable-as-early-as-2026-that-could-ultimately-replace-ipad-mini.2418134/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held its earnings call for the first fiscal quarter of 2024 (fourth calendar quarter of 2023), with Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Apple CFO Luca Maestri sharing details on Apple's performance, recent product sales, services growth, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834994" /><br/>
We've highlighted the most interesting takeaways from the earnings call.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>EU App Ecosystem Changes</h2><br/>
Maestri and Cook were asked about possible economic results from the changes that are being made to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> in the European Union. Maestri said that the EU represents just seven percent of Apple's global &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; revenue, while Cook said that impact it is impossible to determine right now because Apple finds it difficult to predict what customers and developers will choose.<br/>
<br/>
"We've really focused on privacy, security and usability," Cook said. "And we've we've tried our best to get as close it in the past in terms of things that people love about our ecosystem, but we're going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply because we need to comply with the with the regulation."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro</h2><br/>
Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that several big companies are planning Vision Pro apps for customers and employees, including Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP. "From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come," said Maestri.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple is "incredibly excited about the enterprise opportunities" with Vision Pro. Walmart, for, example, has a "very cool" merchandising app. There are companies making collaboration and design apps, there are field service applications, apps for control center/command center work, and more. "Really all over the map," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
"We couldn't be more excited about where things are right now," Cook said. "This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple and really took a whole of company effort to bring it this far."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AI</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">Tim Cook said</a> that Apple is spending a "tremendous" amount of time and effort on artificial intelligence, and that details on its AI work will be shared later this year.<br/>
<blockquote>In terms of generative AI which I would guess is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally, as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so we're going to hold that to this as well. but we've got some things that we're incredibly excited about, that we'll be talking about later this year.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Services</h2><br/>
Apple's Services category set an all-time revenue record at &#36;23.1 billion, up from &#36;20.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Paid subscriptions grew double digits year-over-year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple set all-time revenue records in advertising cloud services, and payment services and video, along with December quarter records in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wearables</h2><br/>
The Wearables, Home and Accessories category saw a drop in revenue, coming in at &#36;12 billion, down from &#36;13.4 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac and iPad Sales</h2><br/>
Mac sales were about flat at &#36;7.8 billion (compared to &#36;7.7 billion last year), but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales were way down as Apple released no new models in 2023. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue was &#36;7 billion, down from &#36;9.4 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Active Devices</h2><br/>
Apple now has more than <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-2-2-billion-active-devices/">2.2 billion active devices</a> worldwide, which includes iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-q1-2024-earnings-tidbits/">Apple&#039;s Q1 2024 Earnings Call Takeaways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-q1-2024-earnings-call-takeaways.2418103/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Rumors suggest that Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> software release might be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/ios-18-biggest-update/">"biggest" software update</a> in the history of the device, with multiple AI features rumored.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be working on generative AI technology that will improve <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, the Messages app, and more. AI could be integrated across the operating system, in apps like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, Pages, Xcode, and more.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/02/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/">announced</a> financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2024, which corresponds to the fourth calendar quarter of 2023.<br/>

For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of &#36;119.6 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;33.9 billion, or &#36;2.18 per diluted share, compared to revenue of &#36;117.2 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;30.0 billion, or &#36;1.88 per diluted share, in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/02/apple-1q-2023-earnings/">year-ago quarter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gross margin for the quarter was 45.9 percent, compared to 43.0 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of &#36;0.24 per share, payable on February 15 to shareholders of record as of February 12.<blockquote>"Today Apple is reporting revenue growth for the December quarter fueled by iPhone sales, and an all-time revenue record in Services," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "We are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments. And as customers begin to experience the incredible Apple Vision Pro tomorrow, we are committed as ever to the pursuit of groundbreaking innovation — in line with our values and on behalf of our customers."</blockquote>As has been the case for over three years now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current quarter ending in March.<br/>

<br/>
<b>2:14 pm</b>: "In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at &#36;12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14 week last year."<br/>

<br/>
<b>2:20 pm</b>: "Revenue for the December quarter was &#36;119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. In the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter, and second. we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a two percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:20 pm</b>: "We set all-time revenue records in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:21 pm</b>: "Products revenue was &#36;96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, offset by challenging compares for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and wearables home and accessories, and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:21 pm</b>: "Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments and is now over 2.2 billion active devices."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:22 pm</b>: "Services revenue set an all time record of &#36;23.1 billion, up 11% year over year when we take into account the extra week last year. This represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We're very pleased with our services performance in both developed and emerging markets."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:23 pm</b>: "Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Product gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leveraging mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:24 pm</b>: "Operating expenses of &#36;14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided. Net income was &#36;33.9 billion, up 3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was &#36;2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all time record, and operating cash flow was very strong at &#36;39.9 billion."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:24 pm</b>: "Our &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; active installed base grew to a new all time high and we had an all time record number of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving the new &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; family with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the US. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, many &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Cantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the US and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:26 pm</b>: "Mac generated revenue of &#36;7.8 billion and returned to growth despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter and we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the US."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:26 pm</b>: "&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; was &#36;7 billion in revenue, down 25% year over year. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 10 generation and we had an extra week of sales. However, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; install base continues to grow and is at an all time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; was recently measured at 98% in the US."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:28 pm</b>: "Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was &#36;12 billion, down 11% year over year due to a challenging compare and the extra week a year ago. <br/>
<br/>
... <br/>
<br/>
We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple watch during the quarter were new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the US and in services. We were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. <br/>
<br/>
Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services; both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high... We had well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:30 pm</b>: He discusses enterprise use of Macs, but also shares interest from companies in the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
"We are seeing strong excitement in enterprise, with leading organizations across many industries such as WalMart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg and SAP interested in leveraging and investing in &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; as a new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to the customers and employees. <br/>
<br/>
From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:30 pm</b>: "We ended the quarter with &#36;173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by &#36;4 billion, leaving us with total debt of &#36;108 billion. As a result, net cash was &#36;65 billion at the end of the quarter. And our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly &#36;27 billion to shareholders, including &#36;3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and &#36;20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:31 pm</b>: "We expect both our March quarter total company revenue and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our services business, we expect a similar double digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46 and 47%. We expect our CapEx to be between &#36;14.3 and &#36;14.5 billion we expect OINE to be around &#36;50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: Can you unpack some of the services drivers a bit for us? How we should think about services growth for the March quarter, and then speak to some of those underlying drivers in the December quarter, and then the March quarter?<br/>
<br/>
A:  Let's start with the December quarter. Up 11% to &#36;23.1 billion is an all-time record for us with all-time records in the Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pac, so it was pretty broad base geographically and very strong across all the services categories. Obviously, last year we had an extra week, so the 11% is stronger than the underlying performance that we have reported.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: A: Very significant growth there. What I said during the prepared remarks around the the March quarter, I mentioned that we will continue to grow double digits at a percentage that is similar to what we reported for the December quarter; we don't provide guidance around the different services category, so we will provide more color when we report in three months."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:35 pm</b>: Q: Could you share a bit more detail about the new users you will you were able to onboard over the last 12 months, meaning how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts, either in terms of geographic representation, or skew to certain products or even how their monetization differ from past cohorts?<br/>
<br/>
A: I would say emerging markets have been a very key area of strength for us. India grew in revenue terms by very strong double digits in the December quarter and hit a quarter revenue record. The other emerging markets, like Indonesia, also had a quarterly record, and we had several regions with records from Latin America to the Middle East. And that theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters of the year as well, so emerging markets very very important. And I feel like we're doing a great job there.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:37 pm</b>: Q: First on services, just on the outlook for the March quarter for a similar double-digit growth rate as of the December quarter. I'm just wondering, why not? Why wouldn't it be potentially faster given that the December quarter obviously had a headwind from the extra week comp and some of the pricing uplifts on select <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> services that were implemented last winter should should help in the March quarter. <br/>
<br/>
A: FX was essentially flat in the December quarter so you have a bit of a headwind there, and then when you look at the progression of our services business over the last few quarters, the compares for March are slightly more difficult than compares for December.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:39 pm</b>: Q: It was very interesting to hear about some of the enterprise customer investments into Vision Pro. Could you talk about some of the efforts to support the Vision Pro developer ecosystem, and it was also good to hear about the potential upcoming announcements on AI.<br/>
<br/>
A: We are incredibly excited about the enterprise opportunities with &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. I've seen several demos from different companies, Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks, but Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. <br/>
<br/>
There are firms that are doing collaboration, design apps. There are field service applications. Really all over the map. There are applications that for control center / command center kind of things. SAP has really gotten behind it, and of course SAP is in so many companies that I think there will be a great opportunity for us and enterprise. We couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across apple and really took a whole of company effort to bring it this far.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of generative AI which I would guess is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally, as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so we're going to hold that to this as well. but we've got some things that we're incredibly excited about, that we'll be talking about later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:41 pm</b>: Q: Asking about the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; upgrade cycle and what they saw in December.<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, since the announcement and shipment in September, and you compare that to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> over the same period of time, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; is outselling &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;. Upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:44 pm</b>: Q: How would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time and which Apple product's adoption curve would you look at us potentially the most similar?<br/>
<br/>
A: So each product has its own journey and so I wouldn't want to compare it to any one in particular, I would just say we couldn't be more excited. <br/>
<br/>
Internally, we've gotten a incredible amount of excitement from developers and from customers that can't wait till tomorrow to pick up their units. <br/>
<br/>
And we're incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the US starting tomorrow for people that want to check it out. And so we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that that you're familiar with.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5000 patents in the product and it's built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on from, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning. All the hand tracking, the room mapping, all this stuff is driven by AI. And so we're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in a store tomorrow and and see the reaction.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:45 pm</b>: Q: I was hoping to talk a little bit about what are you seeing in China right now? I think from a geographic basis, it's one of the few places that was down double digits while everything else was going up slowly. What do you see now from a competition perspective and a demand perspective in China?<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in China mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest, and you look at it in constant currency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. And so it was the other things that drove the larger contraction year over year. On the good news side, we had solid growth on upgraders year over year in mainland China and we had four of the top six smartphone models in urban China.<br/>
<br/>
Also, IDC just put out a note that you may have seen where we were the top brand for the full year and for the December quarter. And so there's some good news.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:48 pm</b>: Q: Changes in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in Europe. Do you see it having any significant impact financially to your services or the broader Apple P&L statement.<br/>
<br/>
A: We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March. <br/>
<br/>
So the last month of the calendar quarter, the second fiscal quarter. Some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores or marketplaces, if you will. We're also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps.<br/>
<br/>
We've really focused on privacy, security and usability. And we've we've tried our best to get as close it in the past in terms of things that people love about our ecosystem, but we're going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply because we need to comply with the with the regulation. A lot will depend on the choices customers make. <br/>
<br/>
Just to keep it in context, the changes apply to the EU market which represents roughly 7% of our global &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; revenue.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:50 pm</b>: Q: How are you thinking about the component pricing environment as we think about that gross margin into the March quarter and looking forward?<br/>
<br/>
A: Our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points. So a very significant increase. I would say the two primary components of the increase are a favorable mix, we did very well with our high-end models and leverage. It's the biggest quarter of the year for us and so we get the leverage effect.<br/>
<br/>
We had a partial offset on negative impact from foreign exchange, but net obviously, very significant improvement and we had very similar dynamics on the services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also, in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so the combined effect of the two businesses gave us the 45.9 at the total company level.<br/>
<br/>
We are guiding total company gross margin to 46 to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:52 pm</b>: Q: Your capital expenditures have actually come down this last year. As you look to lean in to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to to make investments and set the table for a generative AI platform as we move forward? Just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies.<br/>
<br/>
A: We've always said we will never under-invest in the business, so we are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, and services development. We will continue to invest in every area of the business and at the appropriate level. <br/>
And we're very excited about what's in store for us for the rest of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:54 pm</b>: Q: Asking about impacts to the March quarter, and the compare to last year.<br/>
<br/>
A: Last year, we had this disruption of supply on &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and Pro Max because all the factories shut down due to the COVID 19 situation. And so essentially there was pent up demand as we exited the December quarter they got fulfilled, and we also did the channel fill associated with it during the March quarter, so the close to &#36;5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
On gross margin, good expansion over the last few quarters and now we are guiding to 46 to 47% and that takes into account everything that is going on in the commodity environment and the foreign exchange situation. Obviously, the product and services mix and the outcome of this is the guidance result.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:56 pm</b>: Q:  It's very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise, and, historically, Apple has been a consumer-centric company. And now Mac, it's penetrating more into the enterprise. I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future. Would it still be consumer-centric or do you think it's going to be more enterprise-focused also, as we get into the future?<br/>
<br/>
A: We've really concluded that we can do both. If you look at it what has happened over the last several years, employees are are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology. And so it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision making. That is a huge advantage for Apple, because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well. <br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro, when you look at it, the ton of use cases. I mean, we're starting with a million apps and 600 plus that are have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of enterprise in a long time. So I think, like there is for the Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and of course &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has been in enterprise since since the early days of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:59 pm</b>: Q: How do you think about the differences in macro conditions by region? Do you have a sense of are we nearing the trough from a macro demand perspective? Or how long do you think this particular weakness persists?<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at the US, which obviously drives the vast majority of the revenue, in the Americas, we grew in the December quarter from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; business point of view, and the install base hit an all-time high. If you look at the replacement cycle, it's very difficult to measure the replacement cycle at any given point. And so what we focus on internally a lot is the active installed base. And obviously the sales are usually a cycle. We feel better about about those things.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, the extra week that we had a year ago makes the compare more distorted on the March quarter guide. I would point out to you that the COVID years had a lot of turmoil, a lot of volatility that typically you wouldn't see. If you look at our sequential progression from December to March this year, versus pre-COVID versus a more normal environment, it's actually stronger than those years.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3:00 pm</b>: Q: Just wanted to clarify on China. Are you still upbeat about the opportunity and growth there?<br/>
<br/>
A: We've been in China for 30 years and I remain very optimistic about China over the long term. I feel good about hitting a new install base number, a high watermark, and very good about the growth in upgraders year over year and during the quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3:01 pm</b>: Q: Are you a believer in the thesis that AI and processing on smartphones and devices like yours is going to have a huge role in AI and AI apps, and that's something you guys can take advantage of?<br/>
<br/>
A: Let me just say that I think there's a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The Vision Pro is set to come out tomorrow, and Apple has already released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2/">visionOS 1.0.2 update</a>, which means there will be a day-one update that Vision Pro owners need to install.<br/>
<br/>

<em>CNET</em>'s Scott Stein today shared a video that demonstrates what the Vision Pro looks like when an update is installed. While the update is in progress, there's a bar on the front display that slowly fills up as the update is installed, and when it's done, an Apple logo is shown during a restart.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Vision Pro launches in the U.S. this Friday, and you will be able to try out the headset at your local Apple Store on the same day.<br/>
<br/>

Starting tomorrow at 8 a.m. local time, all Apple Stores in the U.S. will allow customers to sign up for a Vision Pro demo appointment, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/apple-store-vision-pro-demos-details/">expected to last around 20 to 25 minutes</a>. Apple said its first round of appointments will take place from tomorrow through Sunday, with slots to be filled on a first‑come, first‑served basis.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to provide any further information about how to sign up for a demo, but those details will presumably be shared soon.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the Vision Pro starts at &#36;3,499, these free demos will be especially important for customers who want to experience spatial computing without spending a fortune. During the demo, they will learn how to navigate the visionOS operating system, and explore built-in apps such as Apple TV, Photos, and Safari.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/vision-pro-apple-store-demos/">Vision Pro Demo Appointments Begin Tomorrow at All U.S. Apple Stores</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-demo-appointments-begin-tomorrow-at-all-u-s-apple-stores.2418088/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Meta Quest VR headset will soon be able to play spatial videos captured on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/v62-software-update-spatial-video-playback-gamepad-support-browswer/">Meta announced today</a>. The upcoming v62 update will add support for the feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/meta-quest-spatial-video.png" alt="" width="780" height="439" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933969" /><br/>
Spatial videos can be uploaded to the Meta Quest headset using the Meta Quest mobile app, so that the stereoscopic videos captured on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models can be relived on Meta's device for those who do not have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Spatial videos uploaded to the Meta Quest will be converted to the correct format for playback on the device, and it will be stored in the cloud. Spatial video content can be selected from the Files menu for an immersive viewing experience. Several demo videos are available on the Meta Quest so users can experience what spatial videos are like.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added the ability to capture spatial videos specifically for &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; headset owners. On Apple devices, spatial videos can only be viewed on the Vision Pro headset, which is priced at &#36;3,500. Other products show the spatial videos as standard 2D videos.<br/>
<blockquote>We are thrilled to announce support for spatial video playback on Meta Quest! If you have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can now upload spatial videos (a.k.a stereoscopic videos) to your Meta Quest headset using the Meta Quest mobile app--letting you relive the moment with surprising depth. With this new feature, you can experience your memories and media content like never before.</blockquote><br/>
At &#36;500, the Meta Quest is more affordable than the Vision Pro, so the option to watch spatial videos on a lower-cost device might be appealing to some &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; owners.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/meta-quest-spatial-videos/">Meta&#039;s VR Headset Can Play iPhone Spatial Videos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/metas-vr-headset-can-play-iphone-spatial-videos.2418087/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For a few months in 2022, Snapchat parent company Snap sold <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/28/snap-pixy-drone/">a Pixy selfie camera drone</a>. Sales of the device were lackluster and Snap stopped all plans for further work on the device after a four month period. Still, Snap sold 71,000 of the devices, but now it's <a href="https://support.pixy.com/hc/en-us">recalling all of them</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/pixy-drone-snapchat.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-844080" /><br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24058119/snap-recall-pixy-drone-refund">The Verge</a></em>, the batteries in the Pixy are a fire hazard and Snap has <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/Snap-Recalls-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Sold-for-Pixy-Flying-Cameras-Due-to-Fire-Hazard">issued a recall</a> in partnership with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Pixy's battery can overheat, and there have been four reports of battery issues. One incident resulted in a minor battery fire, and a second resulted in a minor injury.<br/>
<br/>
The Pixy was sold on Snapchat's Pixy website and on Amazon between May 2022 and December 2023, with prices ranging from &#36;185 to &#36;250. Snap also sold extra batteries for &#36;16 to &#36;20.<br/>
<br/>
According to the recall notice, customers who purchased a Pixy Flying Camera should remove the battery and stop charging it. Snap is providing refunds for all customers who bought a Pixy.<br/>
<br/>
To get a refund, customers will need to <a href="https://support.pixy.com/hc/en-us">visit the Pixy support site</a> and follow the instructions.

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/spring-2024-apple-watch-bands.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-933881" /><br/>
The information comes from Apple Watch band collector and <em>MacRumors</em> forums member known as "mikedop," who explained that the pictured Sport Loop units originate from China. mikedop's source referred to the colors as "Navy Blue" and "Emerald," although they noted that these names might not be the official titles. Historically, the exact names of Apple's new color options are often lost in translation prior to their release.<br/>

Apple reportedly prototypes around twice as many new color options as it actually releases, so it is not yet known if these ones were approved or not. Apple's annual spring refresh of its accessory colors is likely to launch in early March, perhaps alongside a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> color option.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-bands/">Apple Watch Bands</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/new-colors-heading-for-apple-spring-refresh/">&#039;Navy Blue&#039; and &#039;Emerald&#039; May Be Heading for Apple&#039;s Spring 2024 Accessory Refresh</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/navy-blue-and-emerald-may-be-heading-for-apples-spring-2024-accessory-refresh.2418055/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

In addition, more than one million compatible iOS and iPadOS apps will automatically be available on the Vision Pro at launch. These apps have not been optimized for visionOS, so they will have a more iPad-like appearance. In the streaming space, for example, compatible apps that will be available include Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, and Peacock. Other compatible apps include Slack, Todoist, Comcast Xfinity, Sling TV, ESPN, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-vision-pro-over-600-native-apps/">Apple Announces More Than 600 Apps Already Optimized for Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-more-than-600-apps-already-optimized-for-vision-pro.2418054/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> has been finally pictured wearing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset. The photographs accompany a <em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/tim-cook-apple-vision-pro">Vanity Fair</a></em> article about the device, which leads on the digital cover of the magazine.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/vanity-fair-vision-pro-tim-cook.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933869" /><br/>
This is the first time the Apple CEO has been seen wearing the device since its unveiling at WWDC 2023 in June. Given that Cook is usually keen to model and be seen using Apple devices, particularly during keynote events and speeches, it's interesting that the company appears to have been a little more reticent to take the same approach with Vision Pro, until now.<br/>
<br/>
The article includes interview quotes from &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj;, Greg Joswiak, James Cameron, Jon Favreau, and others on their experience with &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;, how the headset was developed, and more. Here are some select quotes from the piece, which was written by Nick Bilton:<br/>
<blockquote>You can actually lay on your sofa and put the displays on your ceiling if you wish," Cook told me. "I watched the third season of [Ted] Lasso on my ceiling and it was unbelievable!" When I got home and hooked up my own Apple Vision Pro, I watched Ford v Ferrari on my ceiling, and with the spatial audio it felt like Ken Miles’s Ford GT40 was in the room with me. "I think meditation is on a different level than anything I’ve ever experienced, and I've meditated for a long time," Cook said. I've always had trouble meditating, and he was right about that too. "And I use it for productivity," Cook told me.<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
"I would say my experience was religious," the director James Cameron told me when I asked him about his first encounter with the Apple Vision Pro. "I was skeptical at first. I don’t bow down before the great god of Apple, but I was really, really blown away."<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
If there's one consistent grumble about the Apple Vision Pro, it's about the size and weight. It's around 20 ounces, which might not sound like a lot, because you cook with ounces, you don't necessarily wear them. But that's the same as five sticks of butter—imagine walking around with five sticks of butter on your face all day. Carolina Cruz-Neira, a pioneer of virtual reality, told me that the way a device sits on your face really impacts how you respond to the technology. "I’ve been working in VR for over 30 years, and until we can get the scuba diving mask off your face and we make it less noticeable, we’re not going to make this a mass-adoption technology," Cruz-Neira said. "And the size and weight of these scuba diving masks are not going to be solved in a year."<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
"There’s nothing we could have done to make it lighter or smaller," Richard Howarth [Apple VP of industrial design] explained. "This is the state of the art." Everyone else I spoke to at Apple proffered a similar sentiment. "It feels like we've reached into the future and grabbed this product," Joswiak said to me. "You’re putting the future on your face." As did Rockwell, who told me: "We packed just about as much technology as you could possibly pack into that small of a form factor."</blockquote>You can read the full review on the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/tim-cook-apple-vision-pro"><em>Vanity Fair</em> website</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iron-clad grasp on the top spot of <em><a href="https://fortune.com/ranking/worlds-most-admired-companies/">Fortune</a></em>'s "World's Most Admired Companies" shows no signs of weakening, with the tech giant finishing ahead of the 300+ pack for the 17th consecutive year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Logo-Spotlight.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912758" /><br/>
Apple was placed above Microsoft in second place, followed by Amazon in third. All three companies have rounded out the top three for the fifth year in a row. Notably, Nvidia, whose GPU chips are powering servers for generative AI around the world, soared to its highest-ever ranking at number 10. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Fortune</em> ranks companies through a collection of "key attributes of reputation," such as innovation, quality of management, social responsibility, use of corporate assets, financial soundness, quality of products and services, and global competitiveness. Apple topped the list in every category.<br/>
<br/>
As it has in the past, <em>Fortune</em> collaborated with partner Korn Ferry on its survey of corporate reputations. <br/>
<blockquote>To select our 50 All-Stars, Korn Ferry asked 3,720 executives, directors, and securities analysts who had responded to the industry surveys to select the 10 companies they admired most. They chose from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last year’s surveys, plus those that finished in the top 20% of their industry. Anyone could vote for any company in any industry.</blockquote>To see the full ranking of the World's Most Admired Companies, visit <a href="https://fortune.com/ranking/worlds-most-admired-companies/"><em>Fortune</em>'s website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortune-com/">Fortune</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-most-admired-company-17th-year/">Apple Tops &#039;World&#039;s Most Admired Company&#039; List for 17th Consecutive Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tops-worlds-most-admired-company-list-for-17th-consecutive-year.2418046/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is putting the final retail preparations in place for the U.S. launch of its Apple Vision Pro headset on Friday, with dedicated areas in flagship retail stores where customers can test out the device. But Apple's Fifth Avenue retail store in New York appears to be getting special treatment, with a giant replica Vision Pro headset being constructed within the glass cube.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/cube-store-vision-pro-construction.jpeg" alt="" width="1536" height="864" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933856" /><br/>
Photos shared by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/31/apple-vision-pro-fifth-avenue/">9to5Mac</a></em> show scaffolding in front of the glowing Apple logo in the giant skylight above the centerpiece stairway down to the store, where a window display is being erected in the distinctive shape of the Vision Pro goggles. <br/>
<br/>
It's unclear whether the display is unique to "The Cube" or is set to appear in other retail stores around the country, but Apple is certainly hoping to make a splash at possibly Apple's most high-profile U.S. store, and the promotional installation is sure to catch the eyes of passersby and further rouse queueing customers in case they weren't excited enough already.<br/>
<br/>
Steve Jobs originally hired firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson to help with the design of Apple's iconic Fifth Avenue store. He and Peter Bohlin worked closely to create the centerpiece stairway made entirely of glass, the material that would become Apple's signature architectural statement in its flagship stores. The Cube boasted 50,000 visitors a week in its first year, and by 2010 grossed more per square foot than any store in the world. <br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to limit sales of the Vision Pro to customers in the United States to start with, before expanding availability to other countries later in the year. The Vision Pro starts at &#36;3,500, and online pre-orders ship to customers on launch day, February 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-vision-pro-launch-fifth-avenue/">Apple&#039;s Fifth Avenue Store Vision Pro Installation Is Shaping Up to Be a Spectacle</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-fifth-avenue-store-vision-pro-installation-is-shaping-up-to-be-a-spectacle.2418043/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has extended its modem chip licensing agreement with Qualcomm through March 2027, Qualcomm said today during its first earnings call of 2024. Apple's existing agreement has now been extended for two years, so we can expect to see Qualcomm modems in the next several <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> generations.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886940" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/5G-Modem-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple has been working on developing its own 5G modem chip in-house for the last several years. The technology would keep it from having to rely on Qualcomm for 5G chips, but Apple's progress has seen several delays.<br/>
<br/>
In November 2023, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple's work on a modem chip had been postponed until late 2025 or 2026, and it is possible it could see further delays. Apple was initially aiming to have an Apple-designed modem chip ready to go by 2024, but it missed that target. The company then wanted to introduce the modem chip in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> that would launch in spring 2025, but it will not be able to make that goal either.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In an also not surprising development, on the <a href="https://twitter.com/Qualcomm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Qualcomm</a> call, it was mentioned:<br><br>&quot;Apple exercised its unilateral option to extend its global patent license agreement for an additional two years, taking the existing agreement through to March 2027&quot;</p>&mdash; Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BenBajarin/status/1752825042466160735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Gurman said at the time that Apple was "years away" from creating a chip that is able to perform as well or better than chips from Qualcomm.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly run into issues with the Intel code that it has been using from its acquisition of Intel's modem chip business. Apple has had to rewrite code, and adding new features has caused existing features to break. Apple also has to avoid infringing on Qualcomm's patents during its modem development.<br/>
<br/>
The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro models</a> set to be released in 2024 are rumored to be using Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 modem with improved carrier aggregation, and a more power efficient transceiver.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g/">5G</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/">Apple Extends Modem Licensing Deal With Qualcomm Through March 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-extends-modem-licensing-deal-with-qualcomm-through-march-2027.2418014/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Vision Pro Battery Pack Power Cable is Removable</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The cable that connects the Vision Pro battery pack to the headset for power purposes appears to be fixed in place, but it can in fact be removed if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-battery-pack.jpg" alt="" width="1640" height="1060" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929544" /><br/>
Journalist Ray Wong was able to use a SIM card pin to "unlock" the cable, and after he did that, it was able to be removed from the battery pack. There is a small hole located next to the cable, which is apparently a locking mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
The cable that attaches the battery pack to the headset looks similar to a Lightning cable, but it has too many pins to be Lightning. Instead, it is a proprietary cable that won't be able to be connected to other accessories or used for another purpose.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">l used a SIM card push pin to &quot;unlock&quot; the cable connected to the Apple Vision Pro battery pack. It popped right out. <a href="https://t.co/tShScpMlvr">pic.twitter.com/tShScpMlvr</a></p>&mdash; Ray Wong (@raywongy) <a href="https://twitter.com/raywongy/status/1752787114071298255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple likely made the cable removable so that it can be swapped out without the need to replace the entire battery pack should the cable get damaged in some way.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro ships with one battery, and additional modules can be purchased for &#36;199 each. Each battery powers the Vision Pro for somewhere around two to three hours depending on content. The battery also has a USB-C port that can be used with a USB-C cable for charging the battery, with passthrough charging supported.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/vision-pro-battery-removable-cable/">Apple Vision Pro Battery Pack Power Cable is Removable</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-battery-pack-power-cable-is-removable.2417998/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
