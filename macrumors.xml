		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a pair of deals on Amazon, which is discounting the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">M2 MacBook Air</a> to multiple all-time low prices, as well as the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1">Apple Studio Display</a>. Both devices are in stock on Amazon with delivery estimates between June 8 and June 12 as of writing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/m2-macbook-air-pink-image.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953848" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the M2 13-inch MacBook Air, Amazon this week has every model available for &#36;170 off, which are matches for the record low prices on this version of the MacBook Air. These prices are available to all shoppers and do not require a coupon code.<br/>
<br/>
The 256GB model is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;829.00</strong></a> and the 512GB model is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3CGXWN4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,029.00</strong></a>. These deals are only available on Amazon right now, and the retailer has each model on sale in all four colors.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;170 OFF</div>13-inch M2 MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;829.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3CGXWN4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;170 OFF</div>13-inch M2 MacBook Air (512GB) for &#36;1,029.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Following the introduction of the M3 MacBook Air, Apple knocked the price of the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air down by &#36;100, and it's still selling them alongside the M3 model. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-air-generations-compared/">main difference between the two generations</a> lies in the performance upgrade that the M3 chip brings, so if your priority is saving money you stand to benefit from Amazon's steep discounts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/studio-display-purple-february.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936777" /><br/>
Secondly, Amazon has again dropped the price of the Apple Studio Display (Standard Glass) down to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,299.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.00. This is the model with the tilt-adjustable stand, although you can find the same deal on the VESA mount adapter model right now on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;299 OFF</div>Apple Studio Display (Standard Glass) for &#36;1,299.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The Apple Studio Display is a 27-inch monitor that features 5K resolution, supports up to 600 nits of brightness, P3 Wide color for vivid colors, and True Tone to match the white balance of the display to the lighting in the room. There is an upgraded nano-texture glass model, but we aren't tracking any deals on that one this week.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular Mac menu bar management utility Bartender was recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/04/bartender-mac-app-new-owner/">quietly sold to another company</a>, a fact that only came to light after app monitoring service MacUpdater <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1d7zjv8/bartender_5_not_safe_anymore_warning_from/">alerted users</a> that updates to the app from version 5.0.52 could be potentially unsafe due to the lack of transparency surrounding the situation.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/bartender-app.jpg" alt="" width="2128" height="1197" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953571" /><br/>
The original developer has since <a href="https://surteesstudios.com/a-new-chapter/">acknowledged the sale</a>. However, the new Bartender owner is a largely unknown entity that has reportedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1d7zjv8/comment/l7440wb/">hiked</a> Bartender's purchase options, and is alleged to have added code to the app that may be associated with collecting analytics data on users. <br/>
<br/>
Given that Bartender requires extensive permissions to operate in macOS, including screen recording, the whole event has understandably left many users <a href="https://www.threads.net/@wsig/post/C72hn8qOPTH">concerned about privacy</a>. Fortunately, Bartender is not the only app of its kind. So unless Apple ever gets round to integrating better menu bar management into macOS, here are some alternative menu bar utilities that are worth considering. <br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/">Vanilla</a></strong> (Free) – Simple app that lets you hide menu bar icons. Just hold Command and drag icons between hidden and visible sections. Vanilla Pro (&#36;10) adds keyboard shortcuts, a removed section, start at login, and an auto-hide option after 5 seconds.<br/>
</li><br/>
<li><strong><a href="https://icemenubar.app">Ice</a></strong> (Free) – Menu bar management tool that hides items, offers an always-hidden section, show on hover, show on click, show on scroll or swipe, automatic rehide, and app menu overlap correction. Also includes hotkeys, launch at login, and options to change menu bar appearance.</li><br/>
<li><strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066">Hidden Bar</a></strong> (Free) – Lightweight tool that lets you drag a divider between icons in the menu bar to separate hidden and shown sections. Includes launch at login, auto-hide durations, show/hide global shortcut, and full menu bar mode.</li><br/>
<li><strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ibar-menubar-icon-control-tool/id6443843900?mt=12">iBar</a></strong> (Free) – This tool hides menu bar icons which can be revealed in a floating bar that extends below the notch on MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.</li><br/>
<li><strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/barbee-hide-menu-bar-items/id1548711022">Barbee</a></strong> (&#36;3.99) – Management tool with similar interface to Bartender. Includes sections for shown, hidden, and always hidden items, as well as extensive menu bar appearance settings. Also offers ability to quickly search your menu bar items in a Spotlight-style floating window.</li><br/>
<li><strong><a href="https://jacklandrin.github.io/macos%20app/2021/12/01/onlyswitch.html">OnlySwitch</a></strong> (Free) – More than just a menu bar management tool, OnlySwitch offers a broad range of customizable toggle switches designed to offer quick access to system and other settings, such as hide desktop icons, dark mode, hide MacBook notch, mute mic, and more. </li></ul>If you are a BetterTouchTool user, <a href="https://community.folivora.ai/t/bartender-controversy-tutorial-on-how-to-manage-menubar-status-items-via-btt/37429">Andreas Hegenberg</a> has a thorough tutorial on how the utility can be used to hide menu bar items.

		<title>iOS 18: Apple Mail App May Help You Compose and Reply to Your Emails</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Mail in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is set to receive substantial improvements powered by new AI capabilities, including more powerful search, generative "Smart Replies," and email composition assistance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943113" /><br/>
According to a new report from <em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/06/06/ios-18-mail-app-will-get-huge-ai-enhancements-summarizations-with-project-blackpearl">AppleInsider</a></em>, results returned when performing a Mail search will be beefed up to include additional information from Contacts, locations, and locally stored documents.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, "Smart Replies" will rely on Apple's on-device large-language model (LLM), internally known as Ajax. Combined with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>'s deep integration with Mail and the virtual assistant's ability to create replies on the fly at the user's request, Smart Replies are being developed to streamline communication and save time.<br/>
<br/>
Associated with the new Mail features is a new system-wide writing tools framework that could enable text editing via &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. The framework is apparently included in pre-release versions of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Although little is known about its implementation, the report claims that it could help change the style or tone of the user's text as they type an email or message. If a user wanted to sound less casual, for example, they could ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to "Make this text more professional."<br/>
<br/>
The report offers a number of other tidbits related to "Project BlackPearl" – Apple's codename for some cross-system AI and machine learning enhancements – including automatic email categorization based on content (e.g. time sensitivity), ability to summarize emails and email threads, as well as notification summaries based on topic.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has previously touched on many of the other rumored new AI features mentioned in the report that are coming to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj;. You can find more details about them in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">previous coverage</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/ios-18-mail-app-ai-features-smart-reply/">iOS 18: Apple Mail App May Help You Compose and Reply to Your Emails</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-apple-mail-app-may-help-you-compose-and-reply-to-your-emails.2428281/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Swiss-based privacy startup Proton today <a href="https://proton.me/blog/proton-pass-all-devices">announced</a> the availability of Proton Pass for Mac and Linux, bringing the encrypted password manager to every platform for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/proton-pass-mac.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953819" /><br/>
Proton Pass features end-to-end encryption for all stored data, and includes a built-in two-factor authentication system, passkey support, and secure password sharing, as well as a Hide-My-Email feature to protect against spam and phishing. <br/>
<br/>
The macOS version of Proton Pass also comes with a Safari extension, which aims to simplify password management and credential filling within Apple's browser. In addition, unlike Safari's default password manager, Proton Pass allows users to sync across multiple different browsers and devices, for simplified access across all platforms. <br/>
<br/>
Proton Pass uses the Argon2 hashing algorithm, which is included within its offline mode feature, and is available to customers on a paid plan. The encryption method is designed so that passwords and sensitive information remain protected against unauthorized access, even when not connected to the internet. <br/>
<br/>
Proton Pass also integrates Proton's recently announced Pass Monitor functionality, which provides proactive alerts for credentials exposed on the dark web, identifies weak and reused passwords, and checks for missing two-factor authentication. <br/>
<br/>
According to Proton, the password manager will also soon support TouchID on macOS, allowing users to unlock their accounts using their fingerprints. This feature will be provided as an automatic update in the coming weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Proton Pass is available for free with unlimited devices and Password Health included. For a limited time, the company is also offering users the chance to upgrade to the premium Pass Plus plan at a discounted rate of &#36;10 for the first year (usually &#36;23.88).

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has revealed its commitment to a minimum of five years of iPhone security software updates from the date a device is launched, thanks to a new legal requirement in the United Kingdom (via <em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-software-support-commitment-3449135/">Android Authority</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iphone-in-a-box.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953812" /><br/>
Earlier this year, the U.K. established new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-product-security-and-telecommunications-infrastructure-product-security-regime">Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure (PSTI) regulations</a>, which force companies that sell internet-capable products in the country to comply with certain security requirements. <br/>
<br/>
One of the requirements of the PSTI is that companies define a support period, or minimum length of time, for which security updates will be provided after sale. A "security update" is defined by the regulation as a "software update that protects or enhances the security of a product, including a software update that addresses security issues which have been discovered by or reported to the manufacturer."<br/>
<br/>
In compliance with the regulation, Apple has submitted a <a href="https://regulatoryinfo.apple.com/cwt/api/ext/file?fileId=securityTelecommunication%2FiPhone%2015%20Pro%20Max%20%28Model%20A3106%29_V0.pdf">public regulatory filing</a> for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The PSTI filing shows that the device's "defined support period" is a "minimum five years from the first supply date." The "first supply date" is listed as "September 22, 2023," which is when the iPhone 15 series launched.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike Samsung and Google, Apple is not usually explicit about its legacy software support for iPhone devices, so the five-year minimum should come as good news to Apple users holding onto older devices. However, as <em>Android Authority</em> notes, both Samsung and Google guarantee seven years of security updates as well as Android OS updates for their devices, which is two years longer than what Apple is guaranteeing here.<br/>
<br/>
That said, Apple typically provides older devices with the latest security updates longer than the stated five-year period. For example, just this March Apple pushed a security update to iPhone 6s models, which launched in September 2015, or nine years ago. <br/>
<br/>
Going back further, in November 2020, Apple released an update to patch major security issues for the ‌iPhone‌ 5S, which was released in 2013. That's seven years after the device went on sale. In other words, while the minimum-five year period is now set in stone, iPhone users can take comfort in the fact that Apple has a strong history of keeping legacy devices in the loop for several years longer. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-iphone-security-updates-five-year-minimum/">Apple Commits to at Least Five Years of iPhone Security Updates</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-commits-to-at-least-five-years-of-iphone-security-updates.2428265/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will finally address a Safari restriction workaround that has been around for years after the bug was highlighted by <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/a-bug-allowed-kids-to-visit-x-rated-sites-apple-took-three-years-to-fix-it-17e5f65d">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>'s Joanna Stern. Kids who are restricted from viewing certain websites with the Screen Time feature are able to paste a string of characters in the address bar in Safari in order to get around parental controls.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/screen-time-restrictions.jpg" alt="" width="2216" height="1247" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953755" /><br/>
In a report on Screen Time, Stern says that she was able to use a string of characters on her son's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, bypassing the restrictions that prevent access to websites with pornography, violent images, and more. She was able to get around Screen Time on devices running iOS and iPadOS 15, 16, and 17, as well as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement to Stern, Apple said that it is aware of an "issue with an underlying web technology protocol for developers, which allows a user to bypass web content restrictions." A fix is planned for "the next software update."<br/>
<br/>
Security researchers that spoke to Stern said the bug was first reported to Apple in March of 2021, after it was found that inputting a string of characters would get around website restrictions implemented by parents and web blacklists on company devices. The hack worked to bypass restrictions on iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
Apple told the researchers that it was not a security issue, and instead directed them to submit a report using the Feedback tool. After the report was submitted, there was no word back from Apple. Attempting to resubmit the bug to Apple was met with no response.<br/>
<br/>
Apple ignored the issue for three years until Stern was contacted and publicized the problem. It appears that the workaround was not well-known or widely exploited, as the two security researchers that discovered it never shared it.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to promising a fix, Apple said that it is committed to improving the process that's used to receive and escalate bug reports.<br/>
<br/>
Stern's report highlights several other bugs with Screen Time, including issues with app limits, Screen Time usage charts, notifications for more time, and Ask to Buy. Apple improved Screen Time with iOS 17.5, implementing fixes for app and device usage tracking, app limits, and time requests, but the company says there will be additional updates in upcoming software releases.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/screen-time/">Screen Time</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/apple-parental-control-bug-fix/">Apple Promises to Fix Long-Ignored Parental Control Bug After Media Spotlight</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-promises-to-fix-long-ignored-parental-control-bug-after-media-spotlight.2428243/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 196 includes fixes and updates for Canvas, CSS, JavaScript, Web API, Web Inspector, WebGL, and WebRTC. <br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/lowes-vision-pro-experience.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953779" /><br/>
Available in select stores in North Carolina, California, and New Jersey to begin with, the experience provides customers with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> to use the Lowe's Style Studio app that launched alongside the Vision Pro in February. Lowe's Style Studio offers a 3D kitchen environment that can be customized with hundreds of real-world materials, fixtures, and appliances.<br/>
<br/>
While Vision Pro owners are able to use the Style Studio app at home, many Lowe's customers who are planning a kitchen remodel might not have a Vision Pro available to see the different kitchen options. They can instead visit a Lowe's location to partake in an immersive kitchen visualization session.<br/>
<br/>
A Lowe's employee will guide customers through the kitchen creation process during a one-on-one appointment, where there are 80 billion design combinations available. Completed kitchen setups can be saved, emailed, texted, or AirDropped as a PDF, with the content in the kitchen able to be purchased through Lowe's.<br/>
<br/>
From June 8 to June 12, the Vision Pro demo is available at the Central Charlotte, NC Lowe's, and from June 22 through June 25, it will be available at Lowe's stores in North Bergen, New Jersey and Sunnyvale, California. Customers in these areas will be able to <a href="https://www.lowesinnovationlabs.com/projects/lss-in-store">book a session online</a>, with Lowe's also able to accommodate some walk-ins.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/lowes-launches-in-store-apple-vision-pro-experience/">Lowe&#039;s Launches In-Store Apple Vision Pro Experience</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lowes-launches-in-store-apple-vision-pro-experience.2428241/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Vision Pro version of the Apple Developer app has a special immersive Environment included that can be used as a backdrop for watching session videos when WWDC begins next week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/WWDC-2024-YouTube.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953264" /><br/>
Apple's Environment for the Developer app features a black background with neon light animations in the colors of the WWDC artwork that Apple is using this year. It serves as a visually interesting background that's not too distracting for those who want to watch WWDC content with the world shut out.<br/>
<br/>
The Environment is similar to those that Apple has created for general use, such as Yosemite, Mount Hood, and the Moon. It can be accessed when using the Apple Developer app, and immersion can be adjusted with the Digital Crown.<br/>
<br/>

WWDC is set to begin next Monday, with a keynote event that will take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The keynote can be watched in the Apple Developer app, on YouTube, in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app, or on Apple's website.

		<description><![CDATA[Throwboy is known for its pillows that look like classic Macs, but the company is expanding with a <a href="https://throwboy.com/collections/tech-pillows/products/the-app-pillow-collection">new range of pillows</a> that are modeled after Apple's app icons.<br/>

Designed to look like the Messages, Mail, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, Finder, and Notes icons, the pillows are made from a soft, plush material that Throwboy says has a lush and cozy touch. Thick poly filling inside gives the pillows a "cuddly, bouncy feel" and the design on each pillow is embroidered for durability.<br/>
<blockquote>Get your hands on the essential set containing all five app-themed pillows. Whether you're a messaging, music, notes, mail, or icons fan, this collection has got you covered.

Each pillow measures in at 13 by 13 inches, and there is a woven label on the back that can be used to hang them on the wall for those who don't want to use them as cushions.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Customers who bought the &#36;700 AI Pin from Humane should stop using the Charge Case Accessory that came with the device, Humane said in emails that went out today. The email, which was shared by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/5/24172377/humane-ai-pin-battery-case-issue-warning">The Verge</a></em>, says the charging case "may pose a fire safety risk."<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922090" /><br/>
Humane claims that it is contacting customers "out of an abundance of caution." After a report of a charging issue, Humane says that it looked into the Charge Case and found a quality issue with the battery cell. A third-party vendor supplied the cell, and Humane said that it is no longer working with that supplier.<br/>
<br/>
Humane is working to find a new battery vendor, and the company says the problem is limited to the Charge Case. The AI Pin, Battery Boosters, and Charge Pad are not impacted, so the device can still be charged.<br/>
<br/>
Customers should stop using and charging the Charge Case Accessory "immediately." Humane is not issuing a recall or refunding customers, but it will be providing customers with two months of the Humane subscription for free.<br/>
<br/>
The AI Pin, which launched in November, is a standalone device that was designed specifically for AI. It attaches to a clothing item using a magnetic battery system, and it responds to questions and queries. There is a "laser ink display" that is able to project information onto the user's hand, and a built-in camera.<br/>
<br/>
Humane's AI Pin did not fare well in reviews, and it was widely criticized for its poor performance.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/humane-ai-pin-charge-case-fire-risk/">Humane Tells Customers to Stop Using AI Pin&#039;s Charge Case Due to Fire Risk</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/humane-tells-customers-to-stop-using-ai-pins-charge-case-due-to-fire-risk.2428230/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fans of large numbers will be happy to know that Apple became a &#36;3 trillion company again today based on market cap, which is the total value of all of the company's outstanding shares. However, chipmaker Nvidia stole the moment.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-vs-Nvidia.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953774" /><br/>
Nvidia not only crossed the &#36;3 trillion mark today for the first time ever, but it overtook Apple to become the world's second most valuable company as of market close today, trailing only Microsoft. Nvidia's stock price has more than tripled over the past year amid strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) server chips.<br/>
<br/>
Apple became the world's first &#36;3 trillion company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/03/apple-becomes-3-trillion-dollar-company/">in January 2022</a>, and it has recrossed that mark several times since then. However, this is the first time that Apple has dropped to be the world's third most valuable company since 2019.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to unveil its own AI strategy during its WWDC keynote next week, with iOS 18 rumored to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/ai-siri-features-ios-18-2025/">smarter version of Siri</a> powered by a large language model (LLM) and many other new AI features. Apple has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/ios-18-ai-features-opt-in-service/">reportedly partnered with OpenAI</a> to integrate ChatGPT on the iPhone, but the exact implementation remains to be seen.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Weather app appears to be experiencing an outage, with some users seeing it fail to load or take 30 seconds or more to update to the current conditions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/weather-off.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-891074" /><br/>
There are reports about the Weather app on social media, and we've also confirmed that it is not fully functional for some users, but Apple's System Status page is not reporting an outage as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
We'll update this post when the Weather app is functioning as normal.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> The iOS Weather app appears to be back up, but the macOS version is still down.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update 2:</b> Apple's System Status page is now reporting a Weather outage limited to next-hour precipitation in Alaska, but the Weather issue appears to be much more extensive than that. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Update 3:</b> Apple has updated the System Status page again to confirm an outage that started at 2:10 p.m. Eastern Time. Apple says that the Weather app may be slow or unavailable. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Update 4:</b> Apple removed Weather from the System Status page, but the Mac app continues to be down and the iOS Weather app loads slowly. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/weather-app-issues-june/">Apple Weather App Experiencing Issues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-weather-app-experiencing-issues.2428219/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1d8wja5/assassins_creed_mirage_is_here_for_ios_and_ipados/">now rolling out</a> for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, as well as iPad Air and iPad Pro models equipped with the M1 chip or newer. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Assassins-Creed-Mirage.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948700" /><br/>
The game will be available in the U.S. starting tomorrow, June 6, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-mirage/id6472704261">according to the App Store</a>. However, due to time zones, it is already available in countries like Australia, New Zealand, India, and Singapore, with Europe to follow in a few more hours.<br/>
<br/>
Ubisoft previously announced that Assassin's Creed Mirage will be free to play for 90 minutes on the iPhone and iPad, and users will be able to unlock the full version with a single &#36;49.99 in-app purchase. However, the game will be 50% off through June 20, so users will be able to unlock unlimited gameplay for &#36;24.99 for the first two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Ubisoft says the iPhone and iPad versions of Assassin's Creed Mirage offer the same experience as the console version, but with touch-based controls.<br/>
<br/>
The game's description in the App Store:<blockquote>In Assassin's Creed® Mirage, you are Basim, a cunning street thief with nightmarish visions, seeking answers and justice. After an act of deadly retribution, Basim flees Baghdad and joins an ancient organization – The Hidden Ones. As he learns their mysterious rituals and powerful tenets, he will hone his unique abilities, discover his true nature, and come to understand a new Creed – one that will change his fate in ways he never could have imagined.</blockquote>Assassin's Creed Mirage was first released for Xbox, PlayStation, and Windows in October.<br/>
<br/>
With the A17 Pro chip, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max support hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, allowing for improved graphics rendering in games. This hardware upgrade has allowed for more AAA games on the iPhone, such as multiple Resident Evil titles and Death Stranding Director's Cut.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/assassins-creed-mirage-rolling-out-for-iphone-ipad/">Assassin&#039;s Creed Mirage Now Rolling Out on iPhone 15 Pro and iPads With M1 Chip or Newer</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/assassins-creed-mirage-now-rolling-out-on-iphone-15-pro-and-ipads-with-m1-chip-or-newer.2428213/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's supply chain will begin shipping the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Vision Pro</a> headset to countries outside of the U.S. by mid-June, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Fifth-Avenue-Vision-Pro-Launch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934152" /><br/>
In a brief <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1798389160673476824">post on social media platform X</a> today, Kuo said the UK, France, Germany, China, Japan, and Singapore will be among the countries that begin receiving Vision Pro shipments later this month. Other countries that could be part of this expansion wave include Australia, Canada, and South Korea, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/vision-pro-keyboard-new-languages/">previously reported</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could share international availability details for the Vision Pro during its WWDC keynote on June 10, alongside visionOS 2. The headset is expected to launch in the first countries outside of the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/apple-vision-pro-international-launch-likely-july/">before the end of July</a>.<br/>
<br/>
visionOS 2 will include more Apple apps optimized for the Vision Pro headset, and address other "missing features," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The update could also introduce some kind of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-vision-pro-mindfulness-respiration/">respiration tracking feature</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-pencil-visionon-support-in-testing/">add Apple Pencil Pro support to the Vision Pro</a>, based on rumors over the past few months.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first launched the Vision Pro in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-launch-day/">in early February</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/vision-pro-international-launch-soon/">Vision Pro Expected to Launch Internationally Soon After Apple Unveils visionOS 2 at WWDC</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-expected-to-launch-internationally-soon-after-apple-unveils-visionos-2-at-wwdc.2428202/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a pair of deals on Apple's <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G91LXFP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1">sixth generation iPad mini</a> and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3K2RS4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1">fifth generation iPad Air</a>, both of which are available on Amazon. These iPads can be delivered as soon as Friday, June 7 for Prime members in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ipads-deals-june.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953676" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the 256GB Wi-Fi M1 iPad Air, Amazon has this model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3K2RS4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;549.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;749.00.

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3K2RS4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;199 OFF</div>256GB Wi-Fi iPad Air for &#36;549.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced new M2 iPad Air models last month, which is why we're seeing steep discounts on the previous generation models more often. You can still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/80-off-the-m2-ipad-air/">save a bit of money on the 2024 models</a> if you're interested in owning the latest version.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has tested a redesigned version of Control Center with a customizable layout for iOS 18, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. However, we have not confirmed if this change has been finalized for the update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Control-Center-Feature-Iridescent-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952915" /><br/>
The new Control Center would feature a drag-and-drop system that allows at least some of the controls to be reorganized directly on the interface, our sources said. Currently, only the smaller controls in the bottom half of Control Center for things like the flashlight and Low Power Mode can be rearranged or removed through the Settings app. <br/>
<br/>
If this plan moves forward, it would represent the biggest redesign to Control Center since iOS 11 was released in 2017. On the iPhone X and newer, the menu can be opened by swiping down from the top-right corner of the screen, providing controls for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, display brightness, volume, and many other system functions.<br/>
<br/>
We'll find out if the redesigned Control Center is happening in just days from now, as Apple is set to unveil iOS 18 during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>. The first beta of iOS 18 will likely be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the keynote, and the update should be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/control-center/">Control Center</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/ios-18-rumor-customizable-control-center/">iOS 18 Rumor: Redesigned Control Center With Customizable Layout</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumor-redesigned-control-center-with-customizable-layout.2428189/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dexcom G7 continuous glucose monitor users can now monitor their blood sugar data in real time on an Apple Watch without having their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to hand, the U.S. medical device manufacturer has announced.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/dexcom-g7-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953635" /><br/>
Using its own dedicated Bluetooth connection, the Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System sends glucose information and personalized alerts directly to the user's Apple Watch, allowing them to "go for a run, enjoy a dinner out, and feel confident leaving their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; behind," according to the <a href="https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2024/Dexcom-G7-Now-Connects-Directly-to-Apple-Watch-in-the-U.S/default.aspx">Dexcom press release</a>.<br/>
<blockquote>"At Dexcom, our users are at the heart of everything we do. Direct to Apple Watch has been one of our most requested features and we're thrilled to roll it out to Dexcom G7 users in the U.S. and around the world," said Jake Leach, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Dexcom. "We've long believed that people with diabetes should be able to view their CGM data where and how they choose. Direct to Apple Watch is a testament to that, allowing people with diabetes flexibility and choice in how they manage their health."</blockquote>Prior to the update, the Dexcom G7's Apple Watch app enabled users to consult a watch face complication, but there was a three-hour delay with synced data. Users will continue to need an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to set up the G7 GCM with their Apple Watch, and the iOS Health app is still required to view blood glucose data alongside other biometrics tracked by Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
The Direct to Apple Watch feature is now available to G7 GCM users in the U.S., U.K., and Ireland, with the feature coming to additional markets later this month. Users will need the Dexcom G7 app version 2.1, an Apple Watch Series 6 or later running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> or later, and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or later.

Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-finalizing-deal-openai-chatgpt-ios-18/">working on a deal</a> with OpenAI to integrate its ChatGPT technology into ‌iOS 18‌, and has come to an agreement to integrate its ChatGPT technology into iPhones and other Apple devices. <br/>
<br/>
That partnership is expected to be announced next week at WWDC. However, the decision to green-light the deal reportedly did not come easily. Executives are said to have had concerns about reputational damage from a "rogue chatbot," while some people within Apple are even said to have a "philosophical aversion" to having a chatbot integrated into Apple software, according to today's report.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, however, Apple believed that consumers would expect the cutting-edge technology to be offered by the company. By outsourcing the chatbot function, Apple also believes it can distance itself from any potentially controversial repercussions, and by providing AI features as an opt-in service, consumers will be given the choice of whether to use it or not.<br/>

Apple is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-google-gemini-ios-18-iphone/">in talks with Google</a> about incorporating Gemini into its operating systems. Apple is negotiating the deals on a case-by-case basis, and may ultimately offer a number of third-party chatbots across its operating systems, according to today's report, citing people familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reportedly began considering a partnership with another company to deliver advanced AI features after it hit a wall in its own artificial intelligence research and development. Apple is known to have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-experimenting-with-chatgpt-tool/">working on its own large language model (LLM)</a>, the algorithm that underpins generative AI, and found that its model could power basic features like voice memo transcriptions, photo editing, new Safari search capabilities, and auto-replies for Mail and Messages. However, Apple is said to have realized "early on" that competitors like Google and OpenAI were "far ahead in chatbots and on-the-fly assistance."<br/>
<br/>
In iOS 18, Apple's LLM work will likely be limited to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/revamped-siri-to-be-at-core-of-new-apple-strategy/">new ‌Siri features</a>, with the virtual assistant expected to be able to‌ control all individual features in apps for the first time. These features are expected to work on-device, with more advanced AI capabilities relying on cloud servers. This may be where OpenAI's technology is more likely to come in. Regardless, Apple is believed to see the OpenAI agreement as a stop-gap measure while it continues to work on its own generative AI technology. <br/>
<br/>
Today's report also claims that Apple is looking beyond chatbots in its AI research, and intends to use LLMs to help power a pair of robotic devices that it is secretly developing. These are said to include the previously rumored table-top <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/">robotic arm with an iPad-like display</a>, as well as a mobile robot that can follow users around and handle chores on their behalf. Apple reportedly also plans to integrate cameras and AI features into future AirPods. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/ios-18-ai-features-opt-in-service/">Bloomberg: iOS 18 Advanced AI Features Likely to Be Opt-In Service</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-ios-18-advanced-ai-features-likely-to-be-opt-in-service.2428177/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
