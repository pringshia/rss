		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Tuesday offered two potential fixes for the recently reported Apple Watch issue where watch face Weather complications fail to load data.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/weather-complications.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913698" /><br/>
Apple Watch owners have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-weather-complication-issues/">complaining</a> of malfunctioning Weather complications since the launch of watchOS 10, with both the initial launch and watchOS 10.0.1 affected. Those impacted are seeing a blank reading where the weather data should be, but tapping into the Weather app shows the expected information.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213943">new support document</a> titled "If the Apple Watch Weather complication isn't working," Apple suggests users affected by the issue try the following:<br/>
<h3>Reset iPhone Settings</h3><br/>
<ol><li>On your iPhone, open the Settings app, then tap Privacy & Security -> Location Services.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap Weather.</li><br/>
<li>Under Allow Location Access, tap Never, then tap your original setting.</li><br/>
<li>Check whether the issue is resolved.</li></ol>If weather data still doesn't load, Apple suggests trying these steps:<br/>
<ol><li>On your iPhone, open the Settings app, then tap General > Transfer or Reset iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Tap Reset -> Reset Location & Privacy.</li><br/>
<li>If prompted, enter your passcode and reset.</li><br/>
<li>Check whether the issue is resolved.</li></ol>Apple on Tuesday also released a new watchOS 10.0.2 update, which was initially thought to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-0-2-weather-complication-fix/">resolve</a> the Weather complication issue, but it seems that a number of users did not see any permanent resolution after updating.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After three months of beta testing, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> is finally available to everyone. macOS updates often don't get as much attention as iOS updates during the beta testing process, but there are plenty of notable reasons install the new software.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgeqM3RqhF4" title="macOS Sonoma: Best Features You Need to Know!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
<h2 id="aerial_screensavers">Aerial Screensavers</h2><br/>
If you're a fan of the aerial screensavers on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, you're in luck because Apple brought them to the Mac in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/macos-sonoma-new-aerial-wallpaper.jpg" alt="" width="2381" height="1339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908212" /><br/>
There are more than 100 videos to choose from across categories that include Landscape, Cityscape, Underwater, and Earth. Most of these are from the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, but there are some from the Sonoma region of California that are new this year. The aerial screensavers accompany matching wallpapers that animate when you wake your display for a seamless transition from screensaver to wallpaper.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="interactive_desktop_widgets">Interactive Desktop Widgets</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> aren't constrained to the Today Center in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, and the focus on widgets is perhaps the most notable change in the update. &zwnj;Widgets&zwnj; can be added directly to the desktop, and they are interactive, just like widgets on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-widgets.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900896" /><br/>
You can check off Reminders, control smart home products, and interact with third-party apps from your Mac's desktop without the need to open up the full app. &zwnj;Widgets&zwnj; blend in to the background when not in use, and through Continuity, there's also an option to see and use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; widgets on your desktop without having to install the corresponding Mac app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="videoconferencing">Videoconferencing</h2><br/>
Apple added a Presenter Overlay that is designed to let you share your screen in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> or third-party video apps like Zoom without blocking your face. The feature basically shows you over your background, so you can present and remain on-screen.<br/>
<br/>
For fun, there are also new 3D reactions that pop up with hand gestures during &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; calls and calls in apps like Zoom. Reactions include Love (hearts), Like (thumbs up), Dislike (thumbs down), Balloons, Confetti, Lasers, Fireworks, and Thunderstorm. The gestures that trigger the effect are listed below.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Heart</strong> - Heart emoji</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Thumbs up</strong> - Thumbs up emoji</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Two thumbs up</strong> - Fireworks</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Single thumbs down</strong> - Thumbs down emoji</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Two thumbs down</strong> - Storm</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Peace sign with one hand</strong> - Balloons</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Peace sign with two hands</strong> - Confetti</li><br/>
 <li><strong>"Rock on" sign with two hands</strong> - Lasers</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You will need an Apple silicon Mac to see the reactions, and they can pop up in any app that uses the camera.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="safari_profiles">Safari Profiles</h2><br/>
Safari supports separate profiles, so you can divide work browsing from personal browsing. Profiles have distinct browser history, extensions, Tab Groups, cookies, and favorites.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macOS-Sonoma-Safari-Profiles.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913427" /><br/>
You can create different browsing profiles for any purpose, so it serves as an extension of the Tab Groups feature that came out with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/">macOS Ventura</a>. You can do Work and Personal, separate out hobbies, plan trips with a separate profile, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="web_apps">Web Apps</h2><br/>
A website like MacRumors.com can now be added to the macOS dock as a web app, so you can get to your favorite websites right from the dock. Web apps saved to the dock feature a simplified toolbar and support notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macOS-Sonoma-Web-App-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913423" /><br/>
<h2 id="game_mode">Game Mode</h2><br/>
If you have an Apple silicon Mac you game on, you can turn on Game Mode, which prioritizes CPU and GPU performance for gaming purposes. Game Mode cuts down on audio latency for AirPods and input latency for select game controllers, speeding up your response times.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macos-sonoma-presenter-overlay.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="951" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913860" /><br/>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2><br/>
Compared to &zwnj;macOS Ventura&zwnj;, &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; drops support for the 2017 MacBook Pro, the 2017 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, and the 2017 12-inch MacBook. It can run on the Macs below:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>iMac</strong> - 2019 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>iMac Pro</strong> - 2017 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Mac mini</strong> - 2018 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>MacBook Air</strong> - 2018 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>MacBook Pro</strong> - 2018 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Mac Pro</strong> - 2019 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Mac Studio</strong> - 2022 and later</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-introduces-global-developer-resource-for-labs-sessions-and-workshops/">today announced</a> the launch of a new "Meet with the Apple Experts" resource for developers, providing developers with opportunities to participate in sessions, workshops, labs, and one-on-one meetings hosted by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-developer-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757303" /><br/>
At the current time, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/events/view/upcoming-events/?shouldHideClosedEvents=true">Apple is offering</a> more than 50 workshops and consultations, some of which are hosted online and some of which are in Cupertino. Most of the events are online and are open to developers around the world, but those that involve the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset are available at the Apple Developer Center at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the events include "Explore the highlights from WWDC23," "Explore what's new in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>," "Optimize Your App for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>," and "Get Started with App Discovery and Marketing." Many of the sessions are hosted in different languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese) to make them accessible to developers outside of the United States. Developers can request one-on-one design and technology consultations to get feedback on app design, resolving bugs, and implementing new technologies.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, developers can request a one-on-one App Review consultation to receive advice on how the review process works, how an app can best align with guidelines, and reasons for common rejections. According to the announcement of the new service, developers will be connected with Apple evangelists, engineers, and designers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's sessions begin as soon as September 27, with many dates in October and November.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/meet-with-apple-experts/">Apple Launches &#039;Meet With Apple Experts&#039; Resource for Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-meet-with-apple-experts-resource-for-developers.2404915/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The watchOS 10.0.2 update appears to address a bug with Weather complications, but the issue is only fixed on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, the two devices that are able to receive the new software.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/weather-complications.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913698" /><br/>
Multiple reports <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-watchos-10-0-2-for-apple-watch-ultra-2-and-series-9.2404873/">on the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a> confirm that watchOS 10.0.2 solves the Weather complication bug, but those who do not have an &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; or an &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; will have to wait for Apple to release another watchOS update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch owners <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-weather-complication-issues/">have been complaining</a> of malfunctioning Weather complications since the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, with both the initial launch and watchOS 10.0.1 affected. Those impacted are seeing a blank reading where the weather data should be, but tapping into the Weather app shows the expected information.<br/>
<br/>
Some users have been able to fix the issue by opening up the Watch app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, toggling the 24-Hour Time switch in the Clock app Settings, and waiting a few seconds before toggling it back to the original position. Others have had luck turning off Location Services on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; temporarily and then toggling it back on after a short waiting period.<br/>
<br/>
These solutions have not worked for all users, however, so there may be no fix for everyone affected until another version of watchOS comes out.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update 7:00 p.m.</b>: A number of users who initially saw the complication working properly after updating to watchOS 10.0.2 are once again seeing broken Weather complications, suggesting any fix after the update was temporary at best.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-9/">watchOS 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-0-2-weather-complication-fix/">watchOS 10.0.2 Fixes Weather Complication Bug on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 [Update: No]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-0-2-fixes-weather-complication-bug-on-apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-update-no.2404909/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Resident Evil 4 remake that's coming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> will be priced at &#36;59.99, the same price that Capcom charges for the game on consoles like the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/resident-evil-4.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913940" /><br/>
Resident Evil 4 <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082">can be pre-ordered</a> on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac right now, and under the in-app purchase list, the full unlock is listed for &#36;59.99. An additional DLC pack is priced at &#36;19.99, and several weapon packs are available at prices ranging from &#36;2.99 to &#36;9.99.<br/>
<br/>
Capcom released the Resident Evil 4 remake on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in March. Compared to the original game from 2005, it features overhauled graphics, new characters, and updated gameplay elements such as the option to create items and ammo from resources.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models include an A17 Pro chip that allows for console-quality games to be played on the device. It supports hardware-based ray tracing and has enhanced GPU capabilities to allow for more system-intensive gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Village, Death Stranding, and Assassin's Creed: Mirage are console games that are set to be released on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the future. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are the only iPhones that will be able to run the games, but it will also be playable on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> and later iPads and Macs. <br/>
<br/>
Resident Evil 4's release date has not yet been announced. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/resident-evil-4-iphone-price/">Resident Evil 4 for iPhone Will Cost &#36;60</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resident-evil-4-for-iphone-will-cost-60.2404900/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.gravastar.com/">GravaStar</a> is a small company that designs quirky speakers and unique desktop power adapters, and its latest product, the <a href="https://www.gravastar.com/products/delta35">Delta35 GaN Fast Charger</a>, combines fun and functionality. The Delta35 is a 35-watt power adapter that looks like a little robot.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/gravastar-delta-35-main.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913847" /><br/>
There are two USB-C ports at the top of the power adapter, LED lights that serve as eyes and glow when the adapter is in use, and fold-up prongs for charging at the bottom. GravaStar has also added two ball-jointed ears or antennae, and two ball-jointed arms.<br/>
<br/>
Both the antennae and the arms can be repositioned and moved around, so the little robot charger can serve as a desktop distraction when it's not in use as a charger. The arms, antennae, and other robotic design elements serve no practical purpose, but they add visual interest to the power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
The two USB-C ports on the Delta35 are at the top of the power adapter. Given this design, it works well plugged into a desktop power strip because that is the ideal orientation of the charger, but it can also be used in the wall. Note that it will look a little odd plugged into the wall because the robot's features will be sideways.<br/>
<br/>
This is a charger that uses Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology as most do these days, so it is compact. It does not take up much room on a desktop and is similar in size to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> charger. While the prongs fold down, the arms and antennae add bulk. Even so, it's still small enough to be tucked into a bag for use as a charger when on the go.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/gravastar-delta-35-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1982" height="1113" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913848" /><br/>
The Delta35 maxes out at 35W, which is enough to charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or MacBook, but it isn't enough capacity to charge multiple devices at their maximum speeds at one time. With just the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> plugged in, the Delta35 is sized for fast charging, and it can deliver a ~50 percent charge in 30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
When two devices are plugged in, the power is split between them with each port receiving 12W, so charging speeds slow down. 35W is on the lower side for a two-port charger, but if you're doing something like charging an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; on your desk throughout the day and don't need power quick, it works out well as a desktop solution.<br/>
<br/>
In my testing, the Delta35 worked as expected, and I appreciated the design, but I do wish it was delivering more power. As it stands, it is appropriate for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and other similar smaller devices, but not more powerful Macs.<br/>
<br/>
I will point out that this is essentially the same as the 35W dual USB-C power adapter that Apple offers alongside the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and charges &#36;59 for. GravaStar's version is cuter and costs a lot less at &#36;30.<br/>
<br/>
The Delta35 GaN Fast Charger can be <a href="https://www.gravastar.com/products/delta35">ordered from the GravaStar website</a> for &#36;29.95. It comes in white and pink and will be shipped starting on October 20.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/gravastar-delta35-fast-charger/">Review: GravaStar&#039;s Unique Robot-Inspired Power Adapter Fast-Charges iPhone and Offers Two USB-C Ports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-gravastars-unique-robot-inspired-power-adapter-fast-charges-iphone-and-offers-two-usb-c-ports.2404889/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-09-25/ai-voice-translation-pilot-lex-fridman-dax-shepard-steven-bartlett/">this week announced</a> an AI translation feature for podcasters that could give it an edge over Apple's podcasting platform. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/0JQ5DAqbMKFFE3WXPvSulX">Voice Translation for podcasts</a> uses artificial intelligence to translate podcasts into additional languages using the original podcaster's voice.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810756" /><br/>
While Spotify developed the tool, it is using OpenAI's latest voice generation technology. It learns the original speaker's voice and style and then translates the podcast into another language. Spotify says that this system will provide a "more authentic listening experience" that is more natural and personal than standard dubbing. Podcasts translated this way will retain the speaker's distinctive speech characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify is testing Voice Translation at the current time, and is working with podcasters like Dax Shepard, Monica Padman, Bill Simmons, Steven Bartlett, and Lex Fridman to create AI-powered voice translations in languages like Spanish, French, and German for both existing episodes and future podcast episodes.<br/>
<br/>
Voice-translated episodes are available worldwide to Premium and Free users. An initial bundle of translated episodes in Spanish are available now, with French and German rolling out "in the coming days and weeks." According to Spotify, the pilot program will provide "important insights" for future expansion and iteration.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple does not have a competing tool at this time for the Podcasts platform, it is experimenting with AI voice technology. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/ios-17-personal-voice/">added a Personal Voice feature</a> that allows you to use AI to create a replica of your voice. Right now, this is an accessibility feature that Apple has designed for those who are at risk of losing their ability to speak, but it stands to reason that Apple could use voice replication in other areas in the future.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/spotify-ai-voice-translation/">Spotify Using AI to Translate Podcasters&#039; Original Voices to Additional Languages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-using-ai-to-translate-podcasters-original-voices-to-additional-languages.2404883/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Today's iOS 17.0.2 and iPadOS 17.0.2 updates arrive as build 21A351 and can be downloaded on eligible iPhones and iPads over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
Note that iOS 17.0.2 was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/warning-update-your-iphone-15-to-ios-17-0-2/">previously made available</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> owners, and those who purchased an &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; were prompted to install the update during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> setup process.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has now made iOS 17.0.2 available for all iPhones compatible with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> instead of limiting it to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, but &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; users already have the software and will not see the update.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, iOS 17.0.2 fixes an issue that could prevent transferring data directly from another &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; during setup, an issue that affected the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's services chief Eddy Cue today testified in the antitrust trial between the U.S. Department of Justice and Google, answering questions about a deal that sees Google set as the default search engine on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/applegoogle.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-736930" /><br/>
According to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23891037/apple-eddy-cue-testimony-us-google">report from <em>The Verge</em></a> today, Google pays Apple billions of dollars per year in order for Google to be set as the default search engine on Apple platforms. The exact amount that Google pays Apple has not been publicly disclosed during the trial, as a lot of the testimony in the case has taken place behind closed doors.<br/>
<br/>
Cue reportedly last negotiated the deal between Apple and Google in 2016. When asked why Apple chose Google as its default search engine, Cue said "there wasn't a valid alternative to Google at the time," and he said there still isn't one.<br/>
<br/>
"We make Google be the default search engine because we've always thought it was the best," added Cue. "We pick the best one and let users easily change it."<br/>
<br/>
Cue acknowledged that Apple feels it is more committed to privacy than Google, but argued that the deal between the two companies requires Google to allow users to search without logging in, and said that Apple has built several privacy protections into its Safari web browser in order to ensure that users are safeguarded.<br/>
<br/>
Cue also admitted that Apple does not allow users to change the default search engine during the iPhone's setup process, but he said this decision supports Apple's goal of getting users "up and running as fast as possible."<br/>
<br/>
To change the iPhone's default search engine at any point after setup, users can simply open the Settings app, tap Safari, tap Search Engine, and select one of the available options: Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Ecosia.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released Safari 17, the newest version of the Safari browser. Safari 17 can be downloaded on macOS Monterey and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/">macOS Ventura</a>, and it brings some of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> features to older operating systems.<br/>
<br/>

Safari 17 introduces support for Profiles, so browsing can be separated into topics like work and personal, plus it adds enhanced private browsing functionality that locks the private browser when it is not in use.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that search has been improved to provide more relevant results, and multiple tabs can be selected to add them to the tab bar or a Tab Group. Apple's full release notes for the update are below:<blockquote>Safari 17 introduces new features, even faster performance, and improved security.<br/>
<br/>
- Profiles keep your browsing separate for topics like work and personal, separating your history, cookies, extensions, Tab Groups, and Favorites<br/>
- Enhanced Private Browsing locks your private browsing windows when you're not using them, blocks known trackers from loading, and removes identifying tracking from URLs<br/>
- Streamlined search offers more relevant, faster, and easier-to-read results<br/>
- Multiple tab selection allows you to select multiple tabs at once and move them around the tab bar or create a Tab Group<br/>
<br/>
Some features may not be available for all regions, or on all Apple devices.</blockquote>Safari can be downloaded from the System Settings menu on &zwnj;macOS Ventura&zwnj; or in System Preferences on macOS Monterey.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/">macOS Ventura</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/">Safari</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234">macOS Monterey</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239">macOS Ventura</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-safari-17/">Apple Releases Safari 17 With Profiles, Locked Private Browsing Windows and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-17-with-profiles-locked-private-browsing-windows-and-more.2404852/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, Apple today released a Studio Display 17 firmware update after several months of beta testing. The update includes improvements to the camera, and it is available after updating to &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839183" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-studio-display-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" /><br/>
The Studio Display firmware can be updated by connecting the display to a Mac. Studio Display owners can go to System Preferences &gt; Software Update to install the firmware.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, the update adds support for zoom, recenter, and manual framing for the built-in camera in the Studio Display, plus it includes minor stability improvements.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been improving the Studio Display camera since the device first launched and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/apple-studio-display/">was criticized</a> for poor camera quality. Back in April of 2022, Apple released firmware to improve the functionality of the built-in camera, improving the contrast, colors, and overall look.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-studio-display-firmware-17/">Apple Releases Studio Display Firmware 17 With Improvements to Built-In Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-studio-display-firmware-17-with-improvements-to-built-in-camera.2404841/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

There were multiple rumors of a lower-cost model coming out sometime around 2025, but that may not happen.<br/>
<br/>

Kuo does not give a reason for why the lower-cost headset may have been nixed, but he says that unless Apple significantly cuts down on cost, significant shipment growth in Vision Pro shipments may not happen in 2025. Kuo expects Apple to ship approximately 400,000 to 600,000 headsets in 2024, and he says that while it will provide an "excellent experience," it may take "longer than the market expects" to become Apple's next star product. <br/>
<br/>
A second-generation version of the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; is expected to go into mass production by the first half of 2027 "at the latest," and Kuo says that it is possible there will be no hardware updates for the Vision Pro until then.<br/>
<br/>
Both <em>The Information</em> and <em>Bloomberg</em> have suggested that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-cheaper-ar-vr-headset/">working on a more affordable version</a> of the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; headset. The initial version will be priced at &#36;3,500, which will put it out of reach of many Apple customers. <br/>
<br/>
The rumors have said that Apple is developing a budget-friendly model that could be closer in price to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but given the high price of the current model, it is unclear how rapidly Apple could bring component costs down. If Apple does indeed continue work on a more affordable model, it could feature lower resolution internal displays and cheaper build materials. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/">Kuo: Low-Cost Apple Vision Pro Might Be Canceled</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-low-cost-apple-vision-pro-might-be-canceled.2404831/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Complaints about heat issues with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models are not related to TSMC's 3-nanometer node that was used for the A17 Pro chip, according to well-respected <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/the-iphone-15-pro-series-overheating-issues-are-unrelated-to-tsmcs-advanced-3nm-node-iphone-15-5f354b1ab155">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<br/>

Kuo says that overheating could be caused by "compromises made in the thermal system design" that allowed Apple to cut down on the weight of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models. Kuo says that the reduced heat dissipation area and titanium frame have negatively impacted the thermal efficiency of the devices. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to address the thermal issues through software updates, but improvements will be limited unless Apple plans to lower processor performance. Kuo believes that if Apple is unable to "properly address this issue," shipments could be impacted over the life cycle of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[macOS Sonoma better optimizes the long-term battery health of the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip, according to Apple's release notes for the software update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macbook-air-spacegray-purple-battery.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913843" /><br/>
"Battery health management updated on 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip to better optimize long term battery health," the release notes state.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not provide any additional details about the exact optimizations that it made, nor have there been any widespread battery health complaints from customers who own this 13-inch MacBook Air model, released in July 2022. Battery health information can be found by opening the System Settings app and clicking on Battery.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211832">support document</a>, Apple explains how the battery health management feature works:<blockquote>Battery health management is designed to improve your battery's lifespan by reducing the rate at which it chemically ages. The feature does this by monitoring your battery's temperature history and its charging patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the measurements that it collects, battery health management may temporarily reduce your battery's maximum charge. This happens as needed to ensure that your battery charges to a level that's optimized for your usage—reducing wear on the battery, and slowing its chemical aging.</blockquote>macOS Sonoma is set to be released today following over three months of beta testing, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/24/macos-sonoma-launch-date-and-features/">key new features</a> including interactive desktop widgets, a Game Mode, the ability to add websites to the Dock as web apps, several Safari improvements, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[EU industry chief Thierry Breton today publicly called on Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> to open the company's ecosystem of hardware and software to rivals (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-breton-tells-apple-ceo-open-its-ecosystem-rivals-2023-09-26/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
Following an in-person meeting with Cook earlier today in Brussels, Belgium, Breton told <em>Reuters</em>:<blockquote>The next job for Apple and other Big Tech, under the DMA (Digital Markets Act) is to open up its gates to competitors. Be it the electronic wallet, browsers or app stores, consumers using an Apple iPhone should be able to benefit from competitive services by a range of providers.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The EU's Digital Markets Act seeks to curtail the power of major tech companies. Designated "gatekeeper" platforms will now face prohibition against favoring their own services over those of rivals. Earlier this month, Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Safari, and iOS were officially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">classified as gatekeepers</a>. Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/">expected to add support</a> for sideloading apps from outside the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; on iPhones and iPads in Europe via an update to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> due to the DMA's requirements.<br/>
<br/>
Breton went on to be critical of Apple's argument that security and privacy are the reasons it protects its closed ecosystem. "EU regulation fosters innovation, without compromising on security and privacy," Breton added. After the discussion, Cook today visited a local Apple retail store in Brussels:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great to connect with team members and customers at Apple Brussels! <a href="https://t.co/RYW2NOGiM9">pic.twitter.com/RYW2NOGiM9</a></p>&mdash; Tim Cook (@tim_cook) <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1706609678522658865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple apparently declined to respond to Breton's latest remarks.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/eu-calls-on-apple-to-open-ecosystem/">EU Chief Calls on Apple CEO Tim Cook to Open Hardware and Software Ecosystem</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-chief-calls-on-apple-ceo-tim-cook-to-open-hardware-and-software-ecosystem.2404803/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Bear in mind that ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; requires Apple Watch Series 4 or later and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> XS or later running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="1._automate_night_mode">1. Automate Night Mode</h2><br/>
On Apple Watch Ultra models, &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; brings a new Modular Ultra watch face that, like the Wayfinder face, supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/">Night Mode</a>. &zwnj;Night Mode&zwnj; puts a red filter on the display, and previously could only be manually activated by turning the Digital Crown. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/1-auto-night-mode.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912577" /><br/>
In &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, however, there's a &zwnj;Night Mode&zwnj; setting in the watch face edit screen for these two watch faces that lets you set it to Auto or On/Off. On the Auto setting, &zwnj;Night Mode&zwnj; will automatically activate in poor lighting conditions, such as when your sleeve is covering your watch or when you look at it in a dark room. Note that turning the Digital Crown no longer works, as this action now brings up the new Widget Stack. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2._check_control_center_status">2. Check Control Center Status</h2><br/>
Small icons at the top of Control Center indicate the status of certain settings — for example, that your Apple Watch is connected to cellular, your location is being used by an app, and features like Airplane Mode and Do Not Disturb are on.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/2-control-center-status.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912587" /><br/>
If you're not sure what a displayed status icon means, you can now tap the icons to get details.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="3._set_multiple_timers">3. Set Multiple Timers</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-label-multiple-timers-ios/">Like iPhones running iOS 17</a>, you can now set multiple concurrent timers on Apple Watch. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/3-multiple-timers-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912582" /><br/>
Open the Timer app, create and start a timer, then tap the + button in the upper right corner to return to the Timers screen, where you can create and start another timer.<br/>
<br/>
With multiple timers counting down, you can use the Digital Crown to switch between timer displays, or alternatively you can keep track of them in the timer list. Tip: to assign a label such as "cupcakes" to a timer, use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. Raise your Apple Watch, then say something like "Set a 12 minute cupcakes timer."<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="4._access_the_app_switcher">4. Access the App Switcher</h2><br/>
In previous versions of watchOS, you could access the Dock by pressing the Side button, but in &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; this action has been reassigned to the Control Center. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/4-access-app-switcher.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912580" /><br/>
You can, in fact, still access the Dock (now called the App Switcher) with a double press of the Digital Crown. Turning the Digital Crown scrolls through apps, and the most recently used app appears at the front of the Dock with other apps behind it, in the order they were last opened. Apps that are currently running a session — a Maps navigation session or a Workout session, for example — appear at the front.<br/>
<br/>
You can also remove apps from the App Switcher: turn the Digital Crown to the app you want to remove, swipe left on the app, then tap X.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="_5._adjust_the_flashlight"> 5. Adjust the Flashlight</h2><br/>
When the flashlight it activated, you can now adjust the brightness intensity by turning the Digital Crown up and down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/5-adjust-flashlight.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912583" /><br/>
To turn on the flashlight, press the Side button to open Control Center, then tap the Flashlight button. Don't forget, you can also swipe left to choose a mode — steady white light, flashing white light, or steady red light.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="6._set_a_target_elevation_alert">6. Set a Target Elevation Alert</h2><br/>
In the compass app, you can set a target elevation and receive an alert after going beyond it. The new alert option is designed to help you stay safe and remind you to rest and acclimate as you move.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/set-target-elevation.jpg" alt="compass" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913731" /><br/>
Open the Compass app, tap the info (i) button, then tap Set Target Alert. Turn the Digital Crown to set the target elevation, then tap the check button, and you'll receive the alert when the elevation is exceeded.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="7._get_relative_waypoint_elevation">7. Get Relative Waypoint Elevation</h2><br/>
Each screen that shows the compass dial in the Compass app has a new Elevation button at the bottom of the display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/compass-3d-view.jpg" alt="compass" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913732" /><br/>
Tap it, and you'll get a 3D-like view of your waypoint elevations relative to your current elevation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="8._browse_waypoints">8. Browse Waypoints</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, you can browse waypoints, including those you’ve created in the Compass app as well as waypoints from guides in the Maps app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/browse-waypoints.jpg" alt="compass" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913777" /><br/>
In the Compass app, tap the info (i) button, then tap Waypoints. Tap Compass Waypoints, and you'll see any waypoints you’ve created as well as automatically generated waypoints such as the location of your parked car and the last estimated locations where cellular connectivity and Emergency SOS were available.<br/>
<br/>
You can also tap a guide, such as My Places or a guide you created in the Maps app, to view those waypoints on the compass. Note that waypoints that are more than 50 miles from you won’t appear on the compass dial. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="9._find_your_iphone_with_directions">9. Find Your iPhone With Directions</h2> <br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> share the same updated Ultra Wideband chip as can be found in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series, so if you have one of the latest Apple Watch models you can use Precision Finding to ping your nearby &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and get accurate directions to it. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/find-iphone-watch.jpeg" alt="find" width="2448" height="1632" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913780" /><br/>
On your Apple Watch, press the Side button to bring up the Control Center, then tap the Ping &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; button. Your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will play a sound and, if your &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; or Ultra 2 is within range, the screen will display a general heading and distance to your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and the size of the circle increases to guide movement in the correct direction. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="10._find_hiking_trails">10. Find Hiking Trails</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, you can use the Maps app to find hiking trails and learn more about them, including details like their name, length, highest and lowest elevations, and the distance from your current location to the nearest access point.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/maps-trails.jpg" alt="maps" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913734" /><br/>
In the Maps app, scroll to the area you want to search, tap the search button, then enter "trails" into the input field. Nearby trailheads will appear as green dots that you can tap, and the name of a trail appears near the bottom of the display. You can also turn the Digital Crown to browse through nearby trail results.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="11._view_offline_maps">11. View Offline Maps</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Apple has added the ability to download Maps for use offline, providing access to turn-by-turn directions and information for a chosen area even if you do not have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/downloaded-apple-maps.jpg" alt="maps" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909329" /><br/>
Offline maps are automatically available on Apple Watch when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is on and within Bluetooth range (about 33 feet or 10 meters). To learn how to download offline maps on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-offline-maps-ios-apple-maps/">see our dedicated how-to</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="12._view_maps_walking_radius">12. View Maps Walking Radius</h2><br/>
The Maps app now includes a new Walking Radius feature that shows you how long it will take to walk to points of interest around you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/maps-walking-radius.jpg" alt="maps" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913735" /><br/>
To change the radius, turn the Digital Crown. You can increase it to a walking time of up to 60 minutes. To change the radius unit to distance, touch and hold the map, scroll down, then tap Distance below Radius Unit.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="13._share_your_location">13. Share Your Location</h2><br/>
Like in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, you can now let others know where you are by sharing your location in Messages, and it will be updated in real time right in the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/share-location.jpg" alt="messages" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913736" /><br/>
Start a new message or open a conversation, tap the A button, then tap the Share Location button. You can then choose to show your live location (Share), which updates in real time, or share your static location (tap the pin icon, then tap Send Pin). <br/>
<br/>
If you share your live location, you can do so For One Hour, Until End of Day, or Indefinitely. To stop sharing your location, simply tap the shared location, then tap Stop Sharing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="14._start_a_group_facetime_call">14. Start a Group FaceTime Call</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, you can now start group <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> audio calls right on your Apple Watch. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/group-facetime.jpg" alt="phone" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913738" /><br/>
Open the Phone app on your Apple Watch, start a &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; audio call, then tap the ellipsis button and tap Add People to choose a contact. When someone joins the call, tap 2 People Active, tap the + button, then choose another contact.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="15._log_your_state_of_mind">15. Log Your State of Mind</h2><br/>
Using the Mindfulness app on Apple Watch, you can log your mood at different times throughout the day and input an overall mood for the day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/log-state-of-mind.jpg" alt="mental" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913741" /><br/>
Tap State of Mind, then tap either "Log how you're feeling right now," or "Log how you've felt overall today." Turn the Digital Crown to indicate how you're feeling then tap the checkmark button. You'll then be asked to choose words that describe how you're feeling and what's having the biggest impact on you.<br/>
<br/>
After you've logged your state of mind, you can check it against other lifestyle factors in the Health app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, under Mental Wellbeing -> State of Mind.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="16._record_video">16. Record Video</h2><br/>
For the first time on Apple Watch, in &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; you can use the Camera Remote app to record video from your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/record-video.jpg" alt="camera" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913750" /><br/>
Simply open the Camera Remote app, position your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to frame the shot using your Apple Watch as a viewfinder, turn the Digital Crown to zoom, then touch and hold the Shutter button to start recording video. Release the button to stop.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="17._plan_home_energy_usage">17. Plan Home Energy Usage</h2><br/>
In the Home app on Apple Watch, Apple has added a new "Grid Forecast" section like the one found on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;. The feature is designed to use your location to tell you when "clean" energy is available to use, so you can be mindful of when you're using energy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ios-17-grid-forecast.jpg" alt="" width="3189" height="1794" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910962" /><br/>
Open the Home app, then tap the Energy category to show the Grid Forecast. Green bars in the widget indicate when cleaner energy is available in your area. If there are no bars, cleaner energy isn't forecast for the near future.<br/>
<br/>
If you're traveling, Grid Forecast shows energy information for both your home location, and the location of your paired &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Note that Grid Forecast is available only in the contiguous United States.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="18._add_another_airplay_device">18. Add Another AirPlay Device</h2><br/>
While controlling audio on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> device such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, you can switch to or add additional &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; devices using the Now Playing app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/now-playing.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913770" /><br/>
On the Now Playing screen, tap the ellipsis (three dots) button. Tap &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj;, then add devices by tapping them. You can also stop playback on any device simply by tapping it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="19._type_to_speak">19. Type to Speak</h2><br/>
Using the Live Speech accessibility feature, you can type on Apple Watch and have your words spoken aloud, both in person and on phone and &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; audio calls. Live Speech can be set up on Apple Watch by going to Settings -> Accessibility -> Live Speech, where you can choose a voice to use. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/live-speech.jpg" alt="settings" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913772" /><br/>
After setting up the Accessibility Shortcut (Settings -> Accessibility -> Accessibility Shortcut -> Live Speech) you can triple-click the Digital Crown and type what you'd like to have spoken out loud.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="20._change_your_email_signature">20. Change Your Email Signature</h2><br/>
By default, messages you send from your Apple Watch are signed with "Sent from my Apple Watch." Prior to &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, you couldn't customize your email watch signature, but now you can.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/mail-signature.jpg" alt="mail" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913773" /><br/>
Open the Watch app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, tap My Watch, tap Mail, then tap Custom. Tap Signature, then create your new signature.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="21._share_a_news_story">21. Share a News Story</h2><br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; introduces an option to share news stories in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a> from your Apple Watch. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/share-news.jpg" alt="news" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913774" /><br/>
Open the News app on your watch, scroll to a story, then tap it. Scroll down, tap the Share button, then choose a sharing option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="22._ping_your_apple_watch">22. Ping Your Apple Watch</h2><br/>
For some time now, it's been possible to ping your misplaced &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with your Apple Watch. In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, you can now do the reverse and ping your Apple Watch with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; if you forgot where you put it down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/ping-watch-control-center.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903766" /><br/>
Apple doesn't include the new Ping My Watch button in the default Control Center set, but you can add it manually: Go to Settings -> Control Center, then under "More Controls," tap the + button next to Ping My Watch. (Okay, technically not a "&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; feature," but still worth knowing!)<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/22-hidden-features-watchos-10-apple-watch/">22 New Features You May Have Missed in watchOS 10</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/22-new-features-you-may-have-missed-in-watchos-10.2404798/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will begin using a new material to make its printed circuit boards thinner starting next year, according to a source with a good track record.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
Apple will reportedly switch to using resin coated copper (RCC) foil as a new printed circuit board (PCB) material in 2024. The change will apparently allow Apple to make its PCBs even thinner. Current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> PCBs are made from a flexible copper substrate material. A thinner PCB could free up valuable space inside compact devices like the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch to provide more room for larger batteries or other components.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro models are expected to grow in size from 6.1- and 6.7-inches to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">6.3- and 6.9-inches</a>, respectively. The increase in size is believed to be partly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/28/gurman-corroborates-iphone-16-pro-size-increase/">due to a need for more internal space</a> for additional components such as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/periscope-lens-exclusive-iphone-15-pro-max/">tetraprism telephoto camera</a> with 5x optical zoom and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">capacitive "Capture" button</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The information comes from an <a href="https://weibo.com/u/1833340431">integrated circuit expert</a> on Weibo, who was first to report that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> would retain the A15 Bionic chip, with the A16 being exclusive to the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ Pro models. Most recently, the user said that the A17 chip designed for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;‌ Plus will be made using a fundamentally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-first-chip-designed-for-standard/">different manufacturing process to the A17 Pro</a> in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> to cut costs.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phone-chip-expert/">Phone Chip Expert</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-looking-to-save-space-with-thinner-pcbs/">Apple Looking to Save Space in Future iPhones With Thinner Circuit Boards</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-looking-to-save-space-in-future-iphones-with-thinner-circuit-boards.2404787/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
