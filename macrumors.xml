		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, Apple introduced an overhauled version of the Magic Keyboard to add new features that make using an &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; feel more like using a Mac. If you’re thinking about buying one of the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models and don’t know if you should get a keyboard, this article walks through all of the new features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-1.jpg" alt="" width="1473" height="829" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950180" /><br/>
<h2>Design</h2><br/>
Apple hasn’t changed the underlying look of the Magic Keyboard, and it continues to use the floating cantilever design introduced with the prior version.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-2.jpg" alt="" width="1225" height="689" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950181" /><br/>
A magnetic back connects to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, allowing for multiple viewing angles by adjusting the amount of tilt. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; hovers over the keyboard and palm rest, which is now made from aluminum, much like the MacBook.<br/>
<br/>
The keys are backlit and use a scissor mechanism with 1mm of travel, the same as the prior-generation model. The outer cover provides front and back protection to keep the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; safe when traveling.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Function Keys</h2><br/>
The updated Magic Keyboard has a dedicated row of function keys for increasing and lowering brightness, changing the volume, controlling media playback, locking the display, initiating a search, turning on Do Not Disturb, starting dictation, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-3.jpg" alt="" width="3174" height="1785" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950182" /><br/>
The function row is similar to the function row on the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Trackpad</h2><br/>
Apple made the trackpad from glass and increased the size, making it easier to work with. The trackpad supports haptic feedback, allowing for multi-touch gestures and improving precision-based tasks like editing spreadsheets and selecting text.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Colors</h2><br/>
The Magic Keyboard comes in black and white.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/magic-keyboard-4.jpg" alt="" width="2073" height="1166" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950183" /><br/>
<h2>Passthrough Charging</h2><br/>
While the Magic Keyboard uses the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/">Smart Connector</a> on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to connect, there is an included USB-C port that can be used for passthrough charging.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Compatibility</h2><br/>
The new Magic Keyboard is compatible with the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, and it comes in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes. It does not work with other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models, and the prior version of the Magic Keyboard does not work with the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Price</h2><br/>
The 11-inch version of the Magic Keyboard is priced at &#36;299, and the 13-inch model is &#36;349.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/">Magic Keyboard</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard/">What’s New With the iPad Pro Magic Keyboard</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what’s-new-with-the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard.2425899/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to power some of its upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> features with data centers that use servers equipped with Apple silicon chips, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-09/apple-to-power-ios-18-ai-features-with-in-house-server-mac-chips-this-year">Bloomberg</a></em>’s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iCloud-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803318" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Ultra chips will be behind some of the most advanced AI tasks that are planned for this year and beyond. Apple reportedly accelerated its server building plans in response to the popularity of ChatGPT and other AI products, and future servers could use next-generation M4 chips.<br/>
<br/>
While some tasks will be done on-device, more intensive tasks like generating images and summarizing articles will require cloud connectivity. A more powerful version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> would also need cloud-based servers. Privacy has long been a concern of Apple’s, but the team working on servers says that Apple chips will inherently protect user privacy.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously claimed that all of the coming &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; features would run on-device, but it sounds like some capabilities coming this year will in fact use cloud servers. Apple plans to use its own servers for now, but in the future, it may also rely on servers from other companies.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/apple-to-power-ai-features-with-m2-ultra-servers/">Apple to Power AI Features With M2 Ultra Servers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-power-ai-features-with-m2-ultra-servers.2425894/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers can opt in to the beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular accessory maker Logitech this week announced <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-learn.html">new keyboard case options</a> that are designed for Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, offering an alternative to the more expensive Magic Keyboard options from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/logitech-keyboard-case-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950160" /><br/>
The Logitech Combo Touch is compatible with both sizes of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and the two thin and light &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. Logitech says that the Logitech Combo Touch is its lightest keyboard to date, improving portability and limiting the bulk added to a tablet setup.<br/>
<br/>
The Combo Touch comes with a detachable keyboard and flexible kickstand for multiple use modes. It can be used for typing in the standard keyboard mode, or folded in a way that allows for sketching, reading, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> use.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/logitech-keyboard-case-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950161" /><br/>
There is a multi-touch trackpad, which Logitech says offers intuitive and precise input and navigation. There are auto-backlit keys in a standard layout with sixteen brightness levels. Shortcut keys allow easy access to volume control, media playback, screenshots, and more, plus there is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/">Smart Connector</a> for connectivity so there's no need for Bluetooth.<br/>
<br/>
The Combo Touch for the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is &#36;200, while the Combo Touch for the 13-inch model is &#36;230. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; versions are priced at &#36;230 and &#36;260, respectively, for the 11-inch and 13-inch models. The keyboards can be <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-learn.html">purchased from the Logitech website</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/logitech-launches-keyboard-cases-for-new-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-models/">Logitech Launches Keyboard Cases for New iPad Air and iPad Pro Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/logitech-launches-keyboard-cases-for-new-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-models.2425889/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week debuted the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, marking the first major revision to the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; lineup since the 2018 launch of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2. There are some major changes that were introduced with the new accessory, including new gestures and capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Newsroom.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949489" /><br/>
<h2>Squeeze</h2><br/>
The squeeze gesture allows the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro to sense when pressure is applied to the sides of the device. Using squeeze brings up a palette so that you can do things like switch tools, line weights, and colors.<br/>
<br/>
Developers can customize how apps react to the squeeze gesture so it can bring up custom controls in each app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Barrel Roll</h2><br/>
There is a gyroscope in the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro that allows the rotation of the barrel to change the orientation of certain tools. It basically offers much more precise control of shaped pen and brush tools, similar to how a real pen or brush would function when you tilt it while drawing or sketching.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Haptic Feedback</h2><br/>
A built-in haptic engine offers haptic feedback when using the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro's gestures. A light haptic pulse will respond when using a squeeze or double-tap gesture, plus there is feedback when using the snap to a Smart Shape feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Find My</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> is available for the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro so it can be tracked right alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and other devices in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Charging and Pairing</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro attaches to the side of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and the magnetic connection enables automatic pairing and charging. There is a new magnetic interface that is available on the 2024 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Existing Features</h2><br/>
Current &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; features like &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover and double tap are supported. Hover lets you preview where the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; will touch down on the display before a mark is made, while double tap can be used for swapping between tools.<br/>
<br/>
Low latency, tilt sensitivity, and pressure sensitivity are all included features.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Compatibility</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro is compatible with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models and the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, so it only works with the May 2024 iPads.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Price</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro is priced at &#36;129, which is also the cost of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/apple-pencil-pro-features/">Apple Pencil Pro: All the New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-pro-all-the-new-features.2425881/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models concurrently, which is why we sometimes get rumored feature leaks so far ahead of launch. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 series is no different, and already we have some idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue-Face-ID-Single-Camera-Hole.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-891051" /><br/>
If you plan to skip this year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 10 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for its successor, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 series, which is likely to be released in September 2025.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">1. Under-Display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a></span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro & &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">expected</a> to be the first ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ to feature under-panel &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; technology. The only external indication of the under-display ‌&zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;‌ technology will likely be a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. This will probably be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple is then <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-under-display-camera/">expected</a> adopt under-display cameras in 2027's "Pro" ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ models for a true "all-screen" appearance.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    2. New Display Sizes</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 & &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
This year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-taller-aspect-ratio/">rumored</a> to be getting bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For 2025, Apple is also expected to bring the larger 6.27-inch display size to its standard ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ model, while the equivalent "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Plus" model could adopt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">completely new display dimensions</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    3. 120Hz ProMotion (Always-on Display)</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 & &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple intends to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/">expand</a> ProMotion to its standard models in 2025, allowing them to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Plus to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">4. Apple-Designed Wi-Fi 7 Chip</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro & &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's premium 2025 models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-apple-wifi-7-chip-rumor/">expected</a> to be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip for the first time. Wi-Fi 7 support would allow the "Pro" models to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. The Wi-Fi chip would also allow Apple to further reduce its dependance on external suppliers like Broadcom, which currently supplies Apple with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">5. 48MP Telephoto Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
An upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto lens on Apple's largest premium device is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/">expected</a> to be optimized for use with Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset, which launches on February 2, 2024. (The current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models feature 48-megapixel main, 12-megapixel ultra wide, and 12-megapixel telephoto lenses.) That would make 2025's "Pro Max" the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to have a rear camera system composed entirely of 48-megapixel lenses, making it capable of capturing even more photographic detail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">6. 24MP Selfie Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Models</span><br><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 lineup will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">24-megapixel front-facing camera</a> with a six-element lens, according to one rumor. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and this year's &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. The upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">7. Scratch Resistant Anti-Reflective Display</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Models</span><br><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">according to one rumor</a>. The outer glass on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 is said to have a "super-hard anti-reflective layer" that is "more scratch-resistant." It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">8. More Memory</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro & &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's Pro models next year will come with 12GB of RAM, claims <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">Jeff Pu</a> of investment firm Haitong. For comparison, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models have 8GB of RAM, while the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are also expected to have 8GB of RAM. Any such increase would allow for improved multitasking on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, as well as provide additional resources for any artificial intelligence features that require large-language models to be resident in memory.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">9. Smaller <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a></span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's highest-end 2025 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will feature a significantly narrower &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, thanks to the device's adoption of a smaller "metalens" for the &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; system, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">claims</a> Haitong's Jeff Pu. Assuming that's the case, it would be the first time that Apple has changed the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; since it debuted on the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">10. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 "Slim" </span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Plus will feature a 6.55-inch display, according to analyst Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC). Responding to a claim by Jeff Pu that the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 17 Plus will be replaced by an "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">iPhone 17 Slim,</a>" Young <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">said</a> to expect a reduction of 2% over the previous, current, and next-generation models. Based on his logic, a smaller display would help differentiate the larger ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 17 model from the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 17 Pro Max, while remaining larger than the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 17 and ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 17 Pro.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/10-reasons-to-wait-iphone-17/">10 Reasons to Wait for Next Year&#039;s iPhone 17</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/10-reasons-to-wait-for-next-years-iphone-17.2425877/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> is now available in two size options, just like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. Yet after a significant update to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; that introduces a thinner design and OLED displays, how different are the two product lines and which should you buy?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-2024-vs-iPad-Air-2024-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949740" /><br/>
The introduction of the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/15/apple-announces-2020-ipad-air/">in September 2020</a> brought the device much closer to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; in terms of design, and with the most recent model, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; gained the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> hover support as the previous &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, bringing them even closer together. The latest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models introduced a large number of significant new changes, such as the M4 chip, OLED displays, and a higher price point, and it means that the high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models are now further differentiated from the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; than before.<br/>
<br/>
Should you consider purchasing the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to save money, or do you need the high-end features of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;? Our guide answers the question of how to decide which of these two iPads is best for you.<br/>

<br/>
Overall, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is the better option for the majority of users, simply on the basis of value for money. For most people, the additional &#36;400+ needed to buy the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is not justified to get the likes of &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, four-speaker audio, and a ProMotion OLED display with refresh rates up to 120Hz.<br/>
<br/>
Some &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; features, such as LiDAR, up to 16GB of memory, and Thunderbolt connectivity are only practically useful to a small niche of users and most will never use some of these high-end capabilities. Many features such as Audio zoom and stereo audio recording may not be meaningfully utilized by many users.<br/>
<br/>
Professionals who have a clear use case for needing larger amounts of RAM and storage, a matte display, Thunderbolt connectivity, and OLED for HDR content will clearly benefit from buying the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. That being said, "prosumer"-style customers who simply want the best &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will enjoy features such as 120Hz ProMotion for smoother scrolling and gaming, deeper blacks and more vivid colors with the OLED display, and the Adaptive True Tone flash for document scanning, even if they are not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond these individual circumstances, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is the best value for money and will be more than ample for most users' needs. With the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, users can get a modern all-screen design, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, practical features like USB-C and 5G connectivity, and compatibility with the core Apple accessories for a price well below that of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-air-vs-ipad-pro/">iPad Air vs. iPad Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 30+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-vs-ipad-pro-buyers-guide-30-differences-compared.2425868/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple finally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">refreshed the iPad Pro</a>, and the new feature set was worth the wait. From new OLED display technology to the M4 chip, the 2024 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> is undeniably impressive. We've rounded up some of the most notable changes worth considering when deciding rather to upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkW5KYwIpoY" title="M4 iPad Pro: Best New Features!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>OLED display</strong> - Both the 11-inch and 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models have an Ultra Retina XDR display that uses tandem OLED technology, which is basically two displays stacked on top of one another. You can expect brighter highlights, deeper true blacks, and better detail in shadows and low light content, plus there's an option for matte nano-texture to cut down on glare.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M4 chip</strong> - The M4 is built using a second-generation 3-nm process with three or four performance cores and six efficiency cores. CPU performance is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-debuts-m4-chip/">up 1.5x compared</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>, and the GPU has hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing. The M4 also has the most powerful Neural Engine ever that's capable of 38 trillion operations per second.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Thin design</strong> - Measuring in at 5.1mm, the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is the thinnest device that Apple has made to date, thinner even than the iPod nano. The 11-inch model isn't much thicker at 5.3mm, and both have slim bezels for maximum screen space. The 11-inch model weighs under a pound, and the 13-inch model is just over.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Camera</strong> - Apple moved the front camera to the landscape side of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, so it's in the right position for FaceTiming and video calls when it's attached to a keyboard.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Accessories</strong> - There's a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-magic-keyboard-ipad-pro/">new Magic Keyboard</a> and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-pencil-pro-announced/">Apple Pencil Pro</a> that go along with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The keyboard has a larger trackpad with haptic feedback, an aluminum palm rest, and a function row for brightness and volume control. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro has a squeeze gesture for selecting tools, haptic feedback, and a gyroscope that adds support for rolling the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; for more precise control.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Removed features</strong> - Apple did drop some options from the latest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. There's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/new-ipad-pro-lacks-mmwave-5g-and-ultra-wide-camera/">no more mmWave 5G chip</a> and it's limited to sub-6GHz, plus there's no SIM slot so it's eSIM only for cellular models. Apple also removed the Ultra Wide camera, so there's just a single-lens 12-megapixel camera and LiDAR sensor in the new models. Sticker fans are out of luck too, because Apple isn't including them in the box.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
If you have an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, the M4 probably isn't worth the update, but for anything older, it's a major upgrade that adds a slew of new features.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipad-pro-best-features/">2024 iPad Pro: Best New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2024-ipad-pro-best-new-features.2425803/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released an iTunes 12.13.2 update for Windows users, with the software introducing support for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846163" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/itunes-for-windows.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
iTunes for Windows is typically updated every few months, and this update follows a December release that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/itunes-for-windows-12-13-1/">added security fixes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iTunes has been phased out on the Mac for several years now and it has been replaced with Finder and the TV app, but Apple has continued to keep the Windows version available.<br/>
<br/>
iTunes for Windows can be downloaded from the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/itunes/9PB2MZ1ZMB1S?hl=en-us&amp;gl=US">Microsoft Store</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210384">from Apple's website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/itunes/">iTunes</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-apps.2">Mac Apps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/apple-releases-itunes-for-windows-12-13-2/">Apple Releases iTunes for Windows 12.13.2 With Support for New iPads</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-itunes-for-windows-12-13-2-with-support-for-new-ipads.2425796/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new iPad Pro and iPad Air models unveiled this week do not include Apple stickers in the box, as a result of Apple's commitment to removing all plastic from its product packaging, according to an Apple Store memo obtained <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/07/new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-apple-stickers/">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-Stickers-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950045" /><br/>
If you really want a sticker, the report said you can still ask an employee for one while purchasing a new iPad Pro or iPad Air at an Apple Store.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not include stickers with the Vision Pro headset, but the new MacBook Air models released in March do come with them, so it appears that Apple is still in the process of gradually phasing out Apple stickers in the box for its latest products.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously announced that it aimed to achieve plastic-free packaging <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/13/apple-to-accelerate-use-of-recycled-materials/">by 2025</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/no-apple-stickers-with-new-ipads/">New iPads Don&#039;t Come With Apple Stickers in the Box</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipads-dont-come-with-apple-stickers-in-the-box.2425795/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the a second release candidate version of an upcoming watchOS 10.5 update to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a day after Apple seeded the first RC.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901009" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Watch-Faces-watchOS-10-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
To install the ‌watchOS 10.5 update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, watchOS 10.5 can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, the update includes support for the new Pride watch face.<blockquote>watchOS 10.5 includes new features, improvements and bug fixes, including a new Pride Radiance watch face to honor the LGBTQ+ community and culture.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In addition to new features like a squeeze gesture, gyroscope, and Find My support, it turns out that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-pencil-pro-announced/">Apple Pencil Pro</a> has a fun packaging twist.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-Wallpapers-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949989" /><br/>
As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Mrwhosetheboss/status/1788159317788483949">Arun Maini</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NikiasMolina/status/1788189987130720629">Nikias Molina</a>, Apple has created five different box designs for the Apple Pencil Pro, each with the word "Pro" in a unique style. When you buy an Apple Pencil Pro, you will receive one of the five boxes at random.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thought this was pretty fun<br><br>The Apple Pencil Pro has 5 different types of box and you have no idea which you&#39;ll get when you order it<br><br>Also each one has the word &quot;Pro&quot; on it in some shape or form <a href="https://t.co/1QQO5akZWW">pic.twitter.com/1QQO5akZWW</a></p>&mdash; Arun Maini (@Mrwhosetheboss) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mrwhosetheboss/status/1788159317788483949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Key new features of the Apple Pencil Pro include the ability to squeeze the accessory to bring up a tool palette, a gyroscope that allows users to roll the Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of shaped pen and brush tools, haptic feedback for certain actions, and the ability to find the Apple Pencil in the Find My app if it is misplaced.<br/>
<br/>
Priced at &#36;129, the Apple Pencil Pro is only compatible with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/everything-announced-may-7-event/">new iPad Pro and iPad Air models</a> announced this week. The first-generation Apple Pencil, second-generation Apple Pencil, and lower-cost Apple Pencil with a USB-C port all remain available, making the Apple Pencil lineup more complex than ever for the time being.<br/>

What If…? reimagines events from the Marvel Cinematic Universe in unexpected ways, and with the Vision Pro experience, fans are able to step into the leading of an immersive story that transforms the space around them as they journey across realities.<br/>
<br/>
There are multiversal variants of key Marvel characters, chances to learn mystic arts, and an opportunity to harness the power of the Infinity Stones.

<br/>
The experience includes “breathtaking environments” of new and iconic MCU locations, with stunning visuals and support for spatial audio. There is no specific release date for “What If…?

		<description><![CDATA[TikTok parent company ByteDance <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/court-filing-on-tiktok-ban-2024">today filed a lawsuit</a> against the U.S. government in an effort to put a stop to the bill requiring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/tiktok-facing-us-ban-congress-passes-bill/">TikTok to be sold off</a> to a non-Chinese company in a matter of months, or face a U.S. ban.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" /><br/>
The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act that passed in April requires ByteDance to divest its TikTok ownership within nine months, with the possibility of a three-month extension if a deal is in progress. If TikTok is not sold off, the bill will prevent app stores and companies in the U.S. from providing the TikTok app to users. As of now, TikTok will be forced to shut down on January 19, 2025.<br/>
<br/>
ByteDance calls the act "obviously unconstitutional," and says that there is no path for TikTok to continue operating in the United States. The 270-day timeline is "not possible," and even if it were, the company claims that the act is still an "extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power."<br/>
<blockquote>If upheld, it would allow the government to decide that a company may no longer own and publish the innovative and unique speech platform it created. If Congress can do this, it can circumvent the First Amendment by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any individual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down. And for TikTok, any such divestiture would disconnect Americans from the rest of the global community on a platform devoted to shared content -- an outcome fundamentally at odds with the Constitution's commitment to both free speech and individual liberty.</blockquote><br/>
The lawsuit argues that the act violates the First Amendment, and it claims that "speculative and analytically flawed" concern over security and content manipulation is an insufficient reason for limiting the free speech of TikTok's 170 million U.S. users.<br/>
<br/>
ByteDance says that a U.S. TikTok platform would not be commercially viable because it would limit the pool of content, undermining "the value and viability of the U.S. TikTok business." ByteDance also claims that it would be technologically impossible to give the TikTok source code to a new owner because it would take years for new engineers to become familiar enough with the code to perform routine maintenance, plus the code would need to be rearchitected not to use ByteDance's software tools, which cannot be done in 270 days.<br/>
<br/>
The Chinese government has said that it will "firmly oppose" any effort to sell TikTok to a U.S. company, and China would need to approve a sale. China has no intention of allowing the TikTok recommendation engine to be divested. ByteDance has already moved U.S. data to servers owned by Oracle, but U.S. lawmakers do not feel that is enough to protect users.<br/>
<br/>
There are few U.S. companies that could afford to purchase TikTok, and the tech giants that could buy it would likely be restricted from doing so due to antitrust concerns.<br/>
<br/>
ByteDance is asking the court to issue a declaratory judgment that the act violates the U.S. Constitution, preventing the U.S. Attorney General from enforcing it.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/tiktok-sues-us-government/">TikTok Sues U.S. Government Over Bill Requiring Sale</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-sues-u-s-government-over-bill-requiring-sale.2425775/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new iPad Pro has dethroned the iPod nano as Apple's thinnest device ever, and the company has promoted this feat in a nostalgic ad.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPod-Nano-vs-iPod-Pro-Ad-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="721" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949953" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@apple/video/7366280606185000238">video shared on TikTok</a> and other social media platforms, Apple highlights the new 13-inch iPad Pro measuring only 5.1mm thick, compared to 5.4mm for the iPod nano. The model shown is a seventh-generation iPod nano, which was released in 2012.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This new Apple ad is  <a href="https://t.co/WVpxaDSpiz">pic.twitter.com/WVpxaDSpiz</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1787891307135881533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/27/apple-removes-ipod-nano-ipod-shuffle/">discontinued the iPod nano</a> in 2017, and this is the first time we have seen the device appear in an ad in quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
Even the 11-inch iPad Pro is now thinner than the iPod nano, as Apple explains:<blockquote>The new iPad Pro — the thinnest Apple product ever — features a stunningly thin and light design, taking portability to a whole new level. The 11-inch model is just 5.3 mm thin, and the 13-inch model is even thinner at a striking 5.1 mm, while both models are just as strong as the previous design. The 11-inch model weighs less than a pound, and the 13-inch model is nearly a quarter pound lighter than its predecessor — allowing pro users to extend their workflows in new ways and in more places.</blockquote>The new iPad Pro models are available to order now and launch May 15.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/">iPod Nano Makes Rare Appearance in Apple Ad for Thinner iPad Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipod-nano-makes-rare-appearance-in-apple-ad-for-thinner-ipad-pro.2425771/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Apple retested the batteries of its iPhone 15 models and updated its battery life claims for the entire series, suggesting that they offer better longevity than previously thought. Curious about the battery health of your iPhone 15? Here's how to check it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
Apple in February 2024 <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-raises-iphone-15-advertised-battery-lifespan/">updated</a> the technical specifications for the batteries in the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. According to its latest tests, Apple says that the devices' batteries are designed to retain 80% of their original capacity at 1,000 complete charge cycles under ideal conditions. <br/>
<br/>
It's a significant improvement over the 500 charge cycles that the company advertises for all older iPhone models over the same cycle count.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 models also include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-battery-charging-limit/">Battery Charging Optimization</a> feature, so if you regularly charge your ‌iPhone‌ up at night while you're asleep, the device can limit its charging to 80%, and then wait for an hour or so before you wake up to charge the remaining 20%. This keeps the ‌iPhone‌ at an optimal capacity for battery health by reducing the amount of time that it's sat on your charger at 100% charged, which can reduce its life over time.<br/>
<br/>
If you have an iPhone 15 with iOS 17.4 or later installed, you can get more specific information on the battery health of your device in the following way:<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Check the readout next to "Battery Health." For more details including your device's battery cycle count, manufacture date, and first use date, simply tap the readout. (In earlier versions of iOS 17, this information was hidden in the <strong>General ➝ About</strong> section of the Settings app).</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iphone-battery-health.jpg" alt="settings" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949899" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the battery lifespan of any iPhone model ultimately depends on how the device is regularly used and charged. While the "Maximum Capacity" readout will give you a good indication of your iPhone's battery health, it's worth tapping on the blue text that says "About Battery & Warranty," which will give you more information on the likely battery lifespan of your device based on how it's used.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life depends on a number of variables, but if you think you have an issue, it's worth remembering that the standard one-year AppleCare+ warranty on an iPhone includes service for defective batteries. Depending on where you are, local consumer laws might even give you cover beyond the standard 12 months, so don't be shy to ask at an Apple Store if you think there's a problem.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-iphone-15-battery-health/">Here&#039;s How to Check Your iPhone&#039;s Battery Health</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-how-to-check-your-iphones-battery-health.2425770/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) today announced the debut of a new Matter 1.3 specification that's available for device makers and platforms. Matter is a smart home protocol that allows smart devices to work across multiple platforms, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/matter-iot-standard.jpg" alt="" width="1720" height="879" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840201" /><br/>
Matter 1.3 adds support for a range of new device types and features, including water management devices, electric vehicle chargers, kitchen and laundry appliances, and TVs.<br/>
<br/>
For smart plugs and other devices, the update includes energy management reporting, allowing users to see actual and estimated measurements of power, voltage, and current, both in-real time and over time. EV Charging manufacturers are able to include Matter-based features such as manually starting and stopping charging, adjusting charging rate, and optimizing charging times.<br/>
<br/>
Water management devices like leak and freeze detectors, rain sensors, and controllable water valves are supported in Matter 1.3, as are several new appliance types including microwave ovens, ovens, cooktops, extractor hoods, and dryers.<br/>
<br/>
For TVs, Matter 1.3 improves casting initialization and search, plus it adds support for push messages and dialog for ambient experiences, expanded interactivity for TV apps, and better interaction with other home devices.<br/>
<br/>
Scenes are supported with the new specification, allowing product makers and platforms to set, read, and activate scenes on devices. Scenes for Matter work like &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; scenes, letting users set a desired state for rooms and devices with one command. Matter controllers are also now able to batch multiple commands into a single message when communicating with Matter devices for less delay between command execution.<br/>
<br/>
Matter 1.3 devices and improvements will likely be available on the market later this year, with more information available on <a href="https://csa-iot.org">the CSA website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/matter/">Matter</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/matter-1-3-specification-released/">Matter 1.3 Specification Adds Energy Reporting, Electric Vehicle Charging, Water Management Support and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/matter-1-3-specification-adds-energy-reporting-electric-vehicle-charging-water-management-support-and-more.2425748/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
