		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.1 update for developers, allowing them to test new features ahead of the software seeing a public launch. The second beta comes a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-releases-first-beta-of-visionos-1-1/">release of the first beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934088" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-Home-Screen.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
The &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 adds an option to reset the Vision Pro in case you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/visionos-1-1-beta-vision-pro-reset-option/">forget your passcode</a>, a feature that was also just released to the public with &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.3 yesterday. Previously, a forgotten passcode would require the Vision Pro to be brought to Apple to reset it.<br/>
<br/>
The update brings support for iMessage Contact Key Verification and it adds Apple device management to the Vision Pro. With this functionality, IT departments at companies and educational institutions can manage Vision Pro headsets in the same way they manage iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's beta notes, users can now reposition volumetric scenes closer than before, enabling easier direct interaction with the volumetric scene content. That means objects can be placed closer to you.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also improved Personas in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj;, making them look more natural and lifelike than before. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/visionos-1-1-beta-2/">Apple Releases Second Beta of visionOS 1.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-second-beta-of-visionos-1-1.2419356/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 to developers for testing purposes, with the updates coming one week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-beta-2/">Apple seeded the second betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932463" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 introduces sweeping changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union, paving the way for alternative app marketplaces, alternative payment systems, third-party browser engine support, and NFC access for banks and third-party payment providers. These features are limited to the EU, and won't be available in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
There are, however, changes to gaming apps, and with the launch of iOS 17.4, Apple will be allowing cloud gaming apps like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW. Mini games, chatbots, and plug-ins are also now able to use the in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
Along with these updates, iOS 17.4 adds new emoji characters, transcripts for podcasts in the Podcasts app, support for using SharePlay with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, Stopwatch Live Activities, and more. Full details on everything new in iOS 17.4 can be found in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1-changes/">our iOS 17.4 features article</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/ios-17-4-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Betas of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-betas-of-ios-17-4-and-ipados-17-4-to-developers.2419351/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers can opt-in to the beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4 introduces some of the features in the iOS 17.4 beta, such as new emoji characters.

To install the ‌watchOS 10.4‌ update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, watchOS 10.4 can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.4 includes new emoji characters such as a lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).<br/>
<br/>
There is also a Vision Pro setting to disable the Double Tap feature on Apple Watch, as the hand gestures might interfere.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/watchos-10-4-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Beta of watchOS 10.4 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-beta-of-watchos-10-4-to-developers.2419352/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.4 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software releases are usually minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes.<br/>
<br/>
The tvOS 17.4 update adds support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> SharePlay on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. The &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; user can pull up an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; QR code that can be scanned by anyone, which then allows multiple people to contribute to what's playing via &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;. An &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription is not required.<br/>
<br/>
We've also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/">seen references to homeOS</a> in tvOS 17.4, but it's not yet clear what homeOS is.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the launch of the Vision Pro, Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Apple_Vision_Pro_Privacy_Overview.pdf">shared a new document</a> outlining various privacy and security measures for the headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-Privacy-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936140" /><br/>
An overview of some of the Vision Pro's privacy policies, according to Apple:<ul><li>Where you look before you interact with content is not shared with Apple or the apps you are using, and does not leave the device.</li><br/>
<li>Apps you use cannot access information about your surroundings by default.</li><br/>
<li>visionOS does not share information about who may be physically nearby with the apps and websites that you use, or with Apple.</li><br/>
<li>Personas are generated entirely on-device, and associated data is encrypted.</li><br/>
<li>Optic ID data for iris authentication is encrypted and never leaves the device.</li><br/>
<li>You can limit the apps that someone else can interact with in Guest User mode to just those currently visible.</li></ul>More details are available in <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Apple_Vision_Pro_Privacy_Overview.pdf">Apple's document</a>, shared earlier <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/13/apple-vision-pro-privacy/">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple privacy features available on visionOS include App Tracking Transparency, Advanced Data Protection, iCloud Private Relay, Hide My Email, and more. iMessage Contact Key Verification was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/vision-pro-imessage-contact-key-verification/">added in the visionOS 1.1 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro launched in the U.S. earlier this month, and Apple said it plans to release the headset in additional countries later this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/">Apple Privacy</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/apple-vision-pro-privacy-and-security-features/">Apple Shares Overview of Vision Pro&#039;s Privacy and Security Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-overview-of-vision-pros-privacy-and-security-features.2419334/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy recently opened up <a href="https://howl.me/clunu1dvWgW">a new Apple Watch sale</a>, and in it you can get the 41mm GPS Apple Watch Series 9 for <a href="https://howl.me/clyFscY8CSo"><strong>&#36;309.00</strong></a> in all aluminum colors, down from &#36;399.00. These deals will only last for the remainder of today, so if you've been waiting for great Apple Watch deals, now is the time to buy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-watch-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930418" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can also get the 45mm GPS Apple Watch Series 9 for <a href="https://howl.me/clCSlnQ3Uf2"><strong>&#36;339.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;429.00. Both of these deals are solid second-best prices that are just &#36;10 higher when compared to their previous all-time low prices.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clyFscY8CSo"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;90 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm GPS) for &#36;309.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clCSlnQ3Uf2"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;90 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm GPS) for &#36;339.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Best Buy has every aluminum model of the GPS Apple Watch Series 9 on sale, so you can get the Starlight, Pink, Midnight, Silver, and PRODUCT(RED) colors on sale at these record low prices. This also includes both S/M and M/L band sizes.<br/>
<br/>
Best Buy also has cellular models of the Apple Watch Series 9 at best-ever prices. You can get the 41mm Cellular model for <a href="https://howl.me/clCSmJRGjPH"><strong>&#36;409.00</strong></a> and the 45mm Cellular model for <a href="https://howl.me/clyFvAK7DJA"><strong>&#36;439.00</strong></a>, both of which are &#36;90 markdowns. Stock on cellular models is much more strained, so you'll only find a few aluminum colors on sale at these prices.<br/>
<br/>
As of last month, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/">sales ban was reenacted</a> in the United States on any Apple Watch model sold by Apple that has blood oxygen sensing. While Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models purchased directly from Apple currently come with blood oxygen sensing disabled, retailers like Best Buy are able to continue selling through their existing stocks that include the feature.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for cheaper Apple Watches, you can also get the Apple Watch SE on sale at Best Buy, all of which are at &#36;60 off. The 40mm GPS model is available for <a href="https://howl.me/clCR9B9mui9"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a>, the 44mm GPS model is available for <a href="https://howl.me/clCSfvk0ZUD"><strong>&#36;219.00</strong></a>, the 40mm cellular model is available for <a href="https://howl.me/clCSggfrO9d"><strong>&#36;239.00</strong></a>, and the 44mm cellular model is available for <a href="https://howl.me/clCSgFaNYsz"><strong>&#36;269.00</strong></a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iMessage will avoid regulation requiring interoperability with other messaging platforms under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), following the conclusion of an investigation by the regulator (via <em><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-13/apple-imessage-microsoft-bing-dodge-eu-s-big-tech-crackdown">Bloomberg</a></em></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
The probe concluded that the iMessage platform and Microsoft's Bing do not hold a dominant enough position to be brought under the DMA's strict rules for services provided by big tech's so-called digital "gatekeepers," which include Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, according to the EU.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and Microsoft said they welcomed the decision to not designate them as core platform services in separate statements following the announcement. <br/>
<br/>
The EU has been working on legislation under the DMA that would have required Apple to make changes to iMessage to make it available on other platforms. The interoperability rules would have meant that Meta apps like WhatsApp or Messenger could request to interoperate with Apple's iMessage framework, and Apple would have been forced to comply within the EU. <br/>
<br/>
However, the EU probe found that iMessage falls outside the legislation because it is not widely used by businesses. The reprieve for Apple is part of a five-month market investigation by the European Commission. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the investigation's conclusion into iMessage, the DMA is still forcing Apple to make major changes to its app ecosystem in the European Union. For example, in iOS 17.4, due later next month, Apple is implementing updates that will allow <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users to download and install apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">alternative app marketplaces</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/">iMessage</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/imessage-avoids-eu-regulation/">Apple&#039;s iMessage Avoids EU&#039;s Digital Markets Act Regulation</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-imessage-avoids-eus-digital-markets-act-regulation.2419320/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Peloton Is Dropping Apple Watch GymKit Support</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Peloton is dropping support for Apple GymKit in favor of Peloton One-Tap tracking, the fitness equipment company revealed to users in an email on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/peloton-bike-plus-treadmill-gymkit.jpg" alt="" width="921" height="457" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757966" /><br/>
The change is most likely to irk existing Bike+ owners who originally purchased the &#36;2,495 stationary workout bike based on the premise that GymKit was an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/08/peloton-announces-bike-gymkit-support/">exclusive perk</a>. While GymKit has become less important since Peloton rolled out Apple Watch integration to all its fitness equipment in 2022, GymKit offered additional integration with Apple Health that isn't available with Peloton's solution.<br/>
<br/>
Peloton's app does most of the things that GymKit offers, including tracking things like distance, pace, and heart rate metrics, and showing them live on Peloton screens. Only a subset of that data will, however, now sync to Apple Health in the absence of GymKit support.<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced GymKit as part of watchOS 4.1, which was released back in October 2017.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update</b>: As <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/posts/32935433">noted</a> by forum member Eradik and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pelotoncycle/comments/1ape43k/apple_gymkit_no_longer_supported_as_of_227/">others on Reddit,</a> Peloton's app syncs only basic data to Apple Health. Data like cadence and average speed and power are not synced, meaning that the loss of GymKit support may have a substantial impact for some users.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gymkit/">GymKit</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peloton/">Peloton</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/peloton-losing-apple-watch-gymkit-support/">Peloton Is Dropping Apple Watch GymKit Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/peloton-is-dropping-apple-watch-gymkit-support.2419319/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Video content no longer includes Dolby Vision HDR or Dolby Atmos surround sound on its ads-supported tier, which is included in all Amazon Prime memberships.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Amazon-Prime-Video-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936178" /><br/>
The news was first reported by German website <em><a href="https://www.4kfilme.de/amazon-prime-video-entfernt-dolby-atmos-und-dolby-vision-im-werbefinanzierten-abo/#google_vignette">4KFilme</a></em> and picked up by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24071417/amazon-prime-video-no-dolby-vision-atmos">The Verge</a></em>. Instead of the higher fidelity options previously enjoyed for no additional fee, Prime Video is streaming in HDR10 with Dolby Digital 5.1. <br/>
<br/>
That is, unless you pay &#36;2.99 extra for Prime Video's ad-free service, in which case you can retain the higher quality audio experience. The change was confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> by Amazon. <br/>
<br/>
"Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos capabilities are only available on the ad free option, on relevant titles," said an Amazon spokesperson.<br/>
<br/>
Most Prime Video viewers will be Amazon Prime members, which costs &#36;14.99 per month, or &#36;139 per year if you pay annually. Prime Video is also available as a &#36;9.99-per-month standalone subscription, or &#36;12.99-per-month if you add on the Dolby Vision HDR or Dolby Atmos surround sound surcharge. Ads were introduced across basic Prime Video subscriptions in the United States on January 29.<br/>
<br/>
For comparison, Disney+ costs &#36;9.99 with ads, while Netflix can be had for &#36;6.99 per month with ads, although content is streamed in 1080p. Meanwhile, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> membership costs &#36;9.99, up from the previous &#36;6.99. Apple introduced the increase on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">October 25</a>, but there are no limits on streaming quality.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon-prime-video/">Amazon Prime Video</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon-prime/">Amazon Prime</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/amazon-prime-video-dolby-vision-atmos/">Amazon Prime Video&#039;s Ads Tier Loses Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amazon-prime-videos-ads-tier-loses-dolby-vision-hdr-and-dolby-atmos.2419316/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well-known talk show host Jon Stewart today confirmed that Apple canceled his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> series "The Problem with Jon Stewart" over content concerns. In a discussion with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/jon-stewart-on-why-hes-going-back-to-the-daily-show-anchor-desk/">CBS Mornings</a> (via <em><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/jon-stewart-explains-apple-exit-why-streamer-canceled-the-problem-1235907986/">Variety</a></em>), Stewart said that Apple did not want him to "say things" that might get him into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/problem-jon-stewart.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917873" /><br/>
<blockquote>I wanted a place to unload thoughts as we get into this election season. I thought I was going to do it over at -- they call it Apple TV+. It's a television enclave, very small. It's like living in Malibu. But they decided ... they felt that they didn't want me to say things that might get me in trouble.</blockquote><br/>
Stewart's television show <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/apple-tv-show-problem-jon-steward-canceled/">was canceled last October</a> ahead of the launch of the third season, and rumors at the time suggested that he had run into "creative differences" with Apple executives. A report from <em>The New York Times</em> claimed that the disagreements were over some planned guests, show topics related to China, and topics related to artificial intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Stewart did not provide details on the specific things that he and Apple clashed over, but he has now validated the rumors over the reason why his &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; series was canceled. Such a high profile cancelation could impact Apple's ability to get similar hosts for future projects, as there could be worries over Apple's level of control. Stewart's show explored current affairs "problems" and episodes featured everything from news in the national conversation to issues that were part of Stewart's advocacy work.<br/>
<br/>
Apple canceled "The Problem with Jon Stewart" ahead of the 2024 election year. Stewart has decided to make a return to "The Daily Show," where he will appear every Monday night through the election cycle. His first return show airs tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Stewart was the host of "The Daily Show" for more than 15 years, and he stepped down eight years ago to hand the reins over to Trevor Noah. Noah retired last year, and so the series has been looking for a new host.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/jon-stewart-confirms-apple-tv-cancelation-reason/">Jon Stewart Confirms Apple Canceled Show: &#039;They Didn&#039;t Want Me to Say Things That Might Get Me in Trouble&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jon-stewart-confirms-apple-canceled-show-they-didnt-want-me-to-say-things-that-might-get-me-in-trouble.2419279/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.0.3 update for the Vision Pro headset, marking the first update that Apple has provided since the device launched. The software comes two weeks after the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2/">visionOS 1.0.2 update</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
The new &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update can be installed by opening the settings app and going to the software update section. <br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.3, Apple added an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213958">option to reset the Vision Pro headset</a> if the passcode set on the device has been forgotten. It also includes unspecified bug fixes. Apple's release notes:<blockquote>This update provides important bug fixes and adds an option to reset your device if you’ve forgotten your passcode.</blockquote>The Vision Pro launched without a way to reset the device without first unlocking it with a passcode, so those who did end up forgetting their passcodes had to go to an Apple retail store to reset it. With the update, if a passcode is rejected a certain number of times, users will get an option to erase the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Note that erasing the Vision Pro does not remove Activation Lock, so a person who stole the headset and used this feature to wipe it would still not be able to log in with their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-3/">Apple Releases visionOS 1.0.3 With Reset Option for Forgotten Passcode</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-3-with-reset-option-for-forgotten-passcode.2419277/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that Apple has launched its Vision Pro headset, we can shift our attention towards what is next on the company's agenda for the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/New-Macs-iPads-iOS-17-4.jpg" alt="" width="3198" height="1798" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936049" /><br/>
As usual, March should be a busy time for Apple, as it is expected to release new MacBook Air, iPad Pro, and iPad Air models during the month. In a recent press release, Apple also confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released in March.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap what to expect from Apple next month.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Macs and iPads</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Apple will likely launch new MacBook Air, iPad Pro, and iPad Air models "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">around the end of March</a>," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air are expected to be updated with the M3 chip simultaneously, with key benefits over the M2 chip including faster performance and hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes are expected for the MacBook Air this year, but the laptop will likely gain support for Wi-Fi 6E like other Macs.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already updated the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip in October 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPad Pro models are widely expected to be the first iPads equipped with more vivid OLED displays. Other rumored or likely features for the iPad Pro include the M3 chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">MagSafe wireless charging</a>, a redesigned Magic Keyboard with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">larger trackpad and an aluminum top casing</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">larger 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> is expected alongside an updated 10.9-inch model. Other rumored or likely features for the iPad Air include the M2 chip, a redesigned rear camera bump, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.4</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">press release</a> announcing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major App Store changes in the EU</a>, Apple confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released in March:<blockquote>Developers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</blockquote>In addition to the changes in the EU, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/04/ios-17-4-new-features-and-changes/">key new features in iOS 17.4</a> include Apple Podcasts transcripts, SharePlay for the HomePod, new emoji, and the ability to use the Apple Cash card on more websites by generating a virtual card number. The update also includes preparations for the launch of next-generation CarPlay later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Other software updates expected to be released in March include iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, watchOS 10.4, tvOS 17.4, and visionOS 1.1. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>New iPhone Color?</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-14-Yellow-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887956" /><br/>
Apple often introduces new iPhone colors around March or April, midway through the smartphone's annual release cycle.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>March 2023:</strong> Apple made the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/07/apple-announces-yellow-iphone-14/">available in Yellow</a>.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After over a year of reports, there are now more than two dozen specific rumors about the features and improvements set to be offered by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models later this year. <br/>
<br/>

All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their direct forerunners are listed below, using information from reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="displays">Displays</h3><br/>
Both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature larger displays than their predecessors, pushing the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max to be the biggest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> ever offered. There are also reportedly improvements to the underlying OLED technology in store.<br/>

This is the standard glass version of the Studio Display with the tilt adjustable stand. You can find every Studio Display model for <a href="https://howl.me/clCr6sJ5Q77">&#36;300 off right now on Best Buy</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-studio-display-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839183" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy.

<br/>
The Studio Display features a 27-inch 5K retina display with a 5120 x 2880 resolution and up to 600 nits of brightness. Discounts on the Studio Display have been very rare over the past few months, and this is the first time in 2024 that we've tracked a record low price on any version of the monitor.<br/>
<br/>

It's available for <a href="https://howl.me/clCrNWURo0s"><strong>&#36;1,599.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,899.99, which is a second-best price on the Studio Display with nano-texture glass.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the standard display is engineered for "extremely low reflectivity," but for rooms where there is a lot of glare, Apple suggests the nano-texture glass option with even less reflectivity.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max could feature the longest-ever battery life offered in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, according to rumors detailing some of the upcoming high-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s improvements coming out of Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Pro-Mock-Header-Updated.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924442" /><br/>
Citing supply chain sources in a <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223348524506&navType=by">post last week</a>, the Naver user known as "yeux1122" corroborates a series of rumors about the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;, such as its display size increase from 6.1- to 6.3-inches. They explain that the device's increased chassis size and internal changes enable the device to offer increased optical zoom capabilities, likely referring to the adoption of the tetraprism 5x telephoto camera first introduced last year on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max. <br/>
<br/>
The user added that the size increase will likely be barely noticeable compared to the current model, but it will still have larger bezels than Samsung's Galaxy S24. The device is also set to feature a similar-sized or larger battery. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; was the only device in the lineup missing from a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">report last week</a> that detailed the next-generation iPhones' battery capacities.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223350403755&navType=by">follow-up post</a>, the Naver user explained that many of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s components will benefit from improved power consumption. Most strikingly, the report added that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will contain a larger battery to reach the longest-ever battery life offered in an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max currently touts a 29-hour battery life, so perhaps the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will tick over 30 hours for the first time ever. <br/>
<br/>
Last week's report suggested that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">5% larger battery</a> than its predecessor for a total of 4,676 mAh. While this is only a very small increase, it is possible that other efficiency savings could help boost the device's overall battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Other details outlined on Naver include the rumor that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will continue to feature 8GB of memory, and that Apple has apparently improved the manufacturing process of the device's titanium frame while reducing costs. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to be announced in the fall.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Later next month, iPhone owners running iOS 17.4 will be able to generate a virtual card number for spending Apple Cash when Apple Pay isn't an online option, according to reports from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleCard/comments/1acdqol/we_finally_have_access_to_the_full_apple_cash/">Reddit users</a> running the latest iOS 17.4 beta (via <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/11/apple-cash-virtual-card-number-feature/">9to5Mac</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>

An Apple Cash pre-paid card allows users to send peer-to-peer Apple Pay payments to friends and family, transfer money to bank accounts, pay off their Apple Card, or spend money online via Apple Pay.<br/>
<br/>
With the new virtual card feature, Apple Cash users will be able to spend their balance even if Apple Pay is not supported by an online store. <br/>
<br/>
According to users with Apple Card on the iOS 17.4 beta, there's new a pop-up inviting them to set up a virtual card number, which Apple says will "keep your card information safe with a new security code for every transaction."<br/>
<br/>
Once generated, the card number can be accessed using Safari AutoFill, and used to shop online "where Apple Pay is not available." Users can also view the card number in Wallet, as well as generate new card numbers and CVC codes.<br/>
<br/>
As <em>9to5Mac</em> notes, the feature may not have been rolled out yet to every beta user. If you're running iOS 17.4 beta and use Apple Cash, you can check by opening the Wallet app, tapping your Apple Cash card, and checking for the option to "Set Up Virtual Card Number."<br/>
<br/>
Apple last month confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released at some point in March. The upcoming software update includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">several new features and changes</a> for the iPhone, as outlined in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">our list</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pay-cash/">Apple Pay Cash</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-cash/">Apple Cash</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/ios-17-4-beta-apple-cash-virtual-number/">iOS 17.4 Beta Lets Apple Cash Users Generate Virtual Card Numbers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-beta-lets-apple-cash-users-generate-virtual-card-numbers.2419240/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Realizing the Apple Vision Pro headset's "ideal form" could take four successive generations of the device, some people in Apple's Vision Products Group believe. That's according to well-connected <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-at-Steve-Jobs-Theater.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898794" /><br/>
Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-11/apple-vision-pro-review-3-499-headset-will-eventually-replace-the-ipad-lshk59z1">Power On</a> newsletter, Gurman says the feeling amongst some of the team working on Apple's headset is that there is much work to do before the device can be considered refined enough for customers to use on a day-to-day basis.   <br/>
<br/>
While it's not clear what Apple's development team consider to be the device's "ideal form," it's easy enough to take cues from some early adopters, whose issues with the first-generation device have extended to both the hardware and the software. <br/>
<br/>
Many Vision Pro users feel the headset itself is too heavy and unwieldy for extended use, making generational miniaturization a crucial touchstone for improvement. Other criticisms have included poor battery life, not enough dedicated apps, and a preponderance of bugs in visionOS.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple's team can resolve those issues over four generations – similar to the progression of the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch – Gurman's take is that the Vision Pro could eventually replace the iPad. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has had "mixed results" in attempting to position the iPad as more of a Mac replacement, Gurman says. Despite Apple's efforts to make it a multitasking device with features like Stage Manager, the iPad has struggled to become a true productivity workhorse like the Mac, and now sits in a limbo amongst Apple's other offerings. "The device lost its original purpose and has become a more confusing piece of Apple's product portfolio," writes Gurman. <br/>
<br/>
As for Vision Pro, which starts at &#36;3,500, "it's going to take some hardware upgrades, a slew of software updates, and far better support from app developers and content makers to actually make the headset the iPad replacement that it's capable of being," adds Gurman. "Until then, the Vision Pro is essentially a prototype — just one where you have to pay Apple for the privilege of testing it out."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/11/apple-vision-pro-fourth-generation-ideal/">Apple Vision Pro Could Take Four Generations to Reach &#039;Ideal Form&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-could-take-four-generations-to-reach-ideal-form.2419188/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In an <a href="https://twitter.com/StellaFudge/status/1756365322301423616">internal memo</a> shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers this week, Apple said it is "aware of" and "investigating" a touch-related issue affecting some Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 displays.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/apple-watch-series-9-display.jpeg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913380" /><br/>
"Some customers may report their Apple Watch Series 9 or Apple Watch Ultra 2 is experiencing false touches on their display," reads Apple's memo, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. Apple said some customers may describe the issue as "ghost" touches.<br/>
<br/>
The issue may cause the screen on affected Apple Watch models to "jump erratically" or exhibit other unexpected behavior, without any user interaction, according to Apple. The memo said the issue can also result in an Apple Watch starting a phone call unintentionally, and prevent users from entering the device's passcode.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recommends that customers keep their Apple Watch's software up to date, suggesting that the company is hopeful it will be able to address the issue in a future watchOS update. Apple did not say how widespread the issue is, or provide a timeframe for a potential fix. It is unclear if defective hardware is a contributing factor.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has instructed technicians not to repair affected Apple Watch models while it investigates. In the meantime, technicians are told to ask customers who are experiencing this issue to force restart their Apple Watch by holding down the Digital Crown and the side button at the same time for at least 10 seconds, until the Apple logo appears.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models were released in September 2023.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aasp/">Apple Authorized Service Providers</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/10/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-touch-screen-issue/">Apple Investigating &#039;Ghost Touches&#039; Issue Affecting Some Series 9 and Ultra 2 Watches</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-investigating-ghost-touches-issue-affecting-some-series-9-and-ultra-2-watches.2419114/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
