		<description><![CDATA[Popular accessory maker Nomad today announced the launch a second-generation glow in the dark band designed for the Apple Watch, with the new version featuring a much more pronounced glow than before.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nomad-glow-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947538" /><br/>
Nomad says that its <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-glow-2">Glow 2.0 Sport Band</a> is three times brighter than the prior-generation version, and it did indeed have a strong and long lasting glow in our testing. In the light, the band is a soft green color, but in the dark, it shifts to a bright, neon green color. Nomad said that it experimented with more than two dozen variations to get the color and glow of the band correct.<br/>
<br/>
To go along with the Glow 2.0 Sport Band, Nomad is also introducing a <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-case-glow-iphone-15-pro-max">Glow Sport Case</a>, which is its first glow in the dark <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> case option. It has the same light green color in the light, and it too turns a neon green to match the band. It is worth noting that glow in the dark products need light exposure, so the intensity and length of the glow depend on the light exposure the watch and case receive during the day.<br/>
<br/>
The Glow 2.0 Sport Band is made from the same FKM fluoroelastomer rubber as Nomad's other Sport Bands, so if you've tried one of those, this is the same general feel. It's thicker and more rigid than Apple's sport band, and the lack of flex makes it a little less comfortable, but it is still overall easy to wear. It is waterproof and sweatproof, so it is ideal for swimming and other activities that involve water. There are holes in the band to keep it from getting too sweaty underneath during heavy activity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nomad-glow-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947539" /><br/>
The case is a variation of Nomad's Sport Case, and it is available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models. The case itself is glossy, but there is adequate grip that keeps it from being easily dropped, and there is a rubber bumper around the sides and the camera. Buttons are made from aluminum and are easy to press, and it does include support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> so it works with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad says that its Sport Cases are designed to provide 8-foot drop protection, and the rubber bumper does provide quite a bit of extra cushioning to the area around the display. The case is not as thin as Apple's silicone case, but it does seem to offer good protection, and the glow in the dark feature is fun at night. During the day, the case is a pleasant light green.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-glow-2">Glow 2.0 Sport Band</a> is priced at &#36;60, while the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-case-glow-iphone-15-pro-max">Glow Sport Case</a> is priced at &#36;50. Both products can be purchased from the Nomad website starting today.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nomad/">Nomad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/nomad-glow-watch-band-iphone-case/">Nomad Launches Glow 2.0 Apple Watch Sport Band and iPhone Case</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nomad-launches-glow-2-0-apple-watch-sport-band-and-iphone-case.2424749/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is promoting its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">upcoming "Let loose" event</a> using six artistic logos amid the expectation that a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> is to be announced.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/5.7.24-Logos-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2925" height="1646" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-947814" /><br/>
The six different logos cycle through randomly upon refreshing <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple's homepage</a>. In 2018, Apple promoted its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2018-event/">"There's more in the making" event</a> that saw the introduction of the radically <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/30/apple-new-ipad-pro-models/">redesigned iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/30/apple-announces-new-apple-pencil/">second-generation Apple Pencil</a> using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/24/all-the-apple-logos/">more than 350 one-of-a-kind Apple logos</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The artistic logos likely allude to the illustration and graphic design capabilities of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, both of which are expected to receive a substantial hardware refresh at the event. The main artwork being used to promote the event features the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> today hinted at the importance of the accessory to the event in a new post on X (formerly Twitter):<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pencil us in for May 7! &#x270f;&#xfe0f; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AppleEvent</a> <a href="https://t.co/1tvyB7h450">pic.twitter.com/1tvyB7h450</a></p>&mdash; Tim Cook (@tim_cook) <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1782785458881302714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
Two new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models and a redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory are also expected to be unveiled at the event.<br/>
<br/>
The May 7 Apple event will take place at 7 a.m. Pacific Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time), with a live stream to be available on apple.com and on YouTube. The event invitation did not mention an in-person component, with Apple inviting the media to watch online alongside the general public.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-has-six-artistic-logos/">Apple Event on May 7 Has Six Artistic Logos as Tim Cook Hints at New Apple Pencil</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-event-on-may-7-has-six-artistic-logos-as-tim-cook-hints-at-new-apple-pencil.2424743/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Mophie Launches Juice Pack Battery Cases for iPhone 15 Lineup</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Mophie today announced the launch of <a href="https://www.zagg.com/mophie/juice-pack/">Juice Pack battery cases</a> that are designed to work with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup. Like Mophie's prior Juice Pack cases, the latest version attaches to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to provide a little extra battery life during daily use.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/mophie-juice-pack.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947521" /><br/>
The case comes apart in two pieces so that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can fit inside, and as the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models have USB-C ports, there is a USB-C charger inside that fits right in to the port. The case also has a USB-C port that can be used for charging the case and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; inside.<br/>
<br/>
Priority goes to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when charging, so if it's plugged in, it'll charge up first, and then the case itself will also charge. It's a super simple solution for adding extra battery life to your phone on a long day.<br/>
<br/>
The Juice Pack for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max that we tested ahead of launch has a 3,000mAh battery, so it's not able to charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to full, but it is about an extra half charge. The 15 and 15 Pro Juice Pack models have a 2,400mAh battery inside because they're smaller, but that also delivers about the same 50 percent battery charge. In my testing, I was able to get about an additional 45 percent battery out of the case once I had drained my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; battery, so Mophie's estimate seems about right.<br/>
<br/>
Mophie's Juice Pack case is made from a soft-touch material that's pleasant in the hand and it only comes in black. It offers a protective lip around the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display and camera, and covers all of the buttons and ports for additional protection. There's a bump at the back for the battery, and while the case remains on the slimmer side is not too bulky, it does add some extra weight. <br/>
<br/>
The case is meant to provide protection from a drop of up to six feet, and it feels rugged enough to be able to handle that kind of impact without damage to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Mophie says that the extra battery life provides up to 44 hours of talk time and music playback, or up to 11 hours of video playback.<br/>
<br/>
There's a button on the back to turn the Juice Pack on and off and to check charge level with the four LEDs. It's handy to be able to turn it off to control when you want to use up the extra battery life rather than having it charge automatically, but note that you do need to hold it down for a few seconds to get charging to initiate. Mophie has Juice Pack cases for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, but there is not a model for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus.<br/>
<br/>
The Mophie Juice Pack can be <a href="https://www.zagg.com/mophie/juice-pack/">purchased for &#36;99.95</a> starting today.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mophie/">Mophie</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/mophie-juice-pack-iphone-15/">Mophie Launches Juice Pack Battery Cases for iPhone 15 Lineup</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mophie-launches-juice-pack-battery-cases-for-iphone-15-lineup.2424736/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is said to be developing its own AI server processor using TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process, targeting mass production by the second half of 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-947754" /><br/>
According to a post by the Weibo user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phone-chip-expert/">Phone Chip Expert</a>," Apple has ambitious plans to design its own artificial intelligence server processor. The user, who claims to have 25 years of experience in the integrated circuit industry, including work on Intel's Pentium processors, suggests this processor will be manufactured using TSMC's &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; node.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC is a vital partner for Apple, manufacturing all of its custom silicon chips. The chipmaker's &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; technology is one of the most advanced semiconductor processes available, offering significant improvements in performance and energy efficiency over the previous 5nm and 7nm nodes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's purported move toward developing a specialist AI server processor is reflective of the company's ongoing strategy to vertically integrate its supply chain. By designing its own server chips, Apple can tailor hardware specifically to its software needs, potentially leading to more powerful and efficient technologies.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could use its own AI processors to enhance the performance of its data centers and future AI tools that rely on the cloud. While Apple is rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-acquires-french-ai-company/">prioritizing on-device processing</a> for many of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-working-on-on-device-llm/">upcoming AI tools</a>, it is inevitable that some operations will have to occur in the cloud. By the time the custom processor could be integrated into operational servers in late 2025, Apple's new AI strategy should be well underway. <br/>
<br/>
The Weibo user has a number of accurate previous claims, including that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 7 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/28/iphone-7-already-rumored-to-be-waterproof/">would be water-resistant</a> and that the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models would continue using the A15 Bionic chip, with the more advanced A16 chip being exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro models. These predictions were later corroborated by multiple credible sources and proved correct upon the products' release. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home">Sonos</a> today unveiled a redesigned Sonos app that is meant to unify an increasingly fragmented streaming market. The app is focused around a customizable home screen that supports more than 100 streaming services, so each user can set up a personalized listening experience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/sonos-redesigned-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947528" /><br/>
The home screen layout can be customized, and it displays the services that each user has set up along with controls for accessing content. There are quick access options for recently played songs, podcasts, and books, along with options to browse libraries and see recommendations from preferred services.<br/>
<br/>
Favorite content and services can be pinned in rows to the home screen, and the rows are rearrangeable and customizable. A built-in always-visible search feature allows users to search for artists, songs, podcasts, audiobooks, and more across all of their preferred streaming apps.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales in China declined significantly in the first quarter of 2024 as consumers turned to other premium smartphone brands, according to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/china-smartphone-q1-2024/">Counterpoint research</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-series-store.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913490" /><br/>
During the first quarter of the year, China's smartphone market experienced modest year-over-year growth of 1.5%, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth. This uptick in sales is largely attributed to strong sales performance from local manufacturers such as Huawei, which achieved a remarkable 69.7% growth compared to the same period last year. This growth was fueled by the launch of Huawei's Mate 60 series, a smartphone lineup that has significantly bolstered the company's dominance in the Chinese premium segment, typically characterized by devices priced over &#36;600.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, Apple saw its smartphone sales in China plummet by 19.1% year-over-year in the same quarter. Analysts point to Huawei's resurgence as a direct challenge to Apple as the main reason for this, primarily in the premium segment where the two companies compete head-to-head. Counterpoint anticipates that upcoming &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models with new color options and AI features could help to rejuvenate Apple's sales in the Chinese market. Looking ahead, the smartphone market in China is projected to see low single-digit growth throughout 2024. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/">Counterpoint</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/iphone-sales-in-china-dropped-significantly/">iPhone Sales in China Dropped Significantly in Q1 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-sales-in-china-dropped-significantly-in-q1-2024.2424731/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the weekend, Apple leaker and prototype collector Kosutami claimed that Apple has decided to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-reportedly-stops-finewoven-production/">halt production</a> of FiveWoven accessories over durability concerns. In a further update, the leaker has now suggested we might yet see <a href="https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1782646277525983293">one more round</a> of <a href="https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1782629715335151821">FineWoven products</a> in a season of new colors before Apple finally says farewell to the material for good.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPhone-15-Pro-FineWoven-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947658" /><br/>
Last September, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">stopped selling genuine leather accessories</a> in favor of a more environmentally friendly "FineWoven" material. The company describes FineWoven as "luxurious and durable microtwill," and sells FineWoven iPhone cases at &#36;59, MagSafe Wallets at &#36;59, AirTag holders at &#36;35, and Apple Watch bands at &#36;99. <br/>
<br/>
Many customers consider FineWoven products to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">subpar</a> compared to the leather Apple cases they replaced, and claim that the fabric is prone to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/">scratches</a>, stains, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/finewoven-iphone-cases-brown-like-rotten-banana/">discoloration</a>. If today's update is correct, Apple may have to brace itself for more unhappy FineWoven customers.<br/>
<br/>
Kosutami is known for revealing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/new-apple-watch-magnetic-band/">accurate information</a> about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/finewoven-cases-may-match-new-watch-band/">FineWoven accessories</a> in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/exclusive-first-look-finewoven-apple-watch-band/">past</a>, so their latest claim should not be discounted. FineWoven accessories in new color options were absent from Apple's spring refresh, so perhaps their swan song could come in September when Apple releases the iPhone 16 lineup. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/finewoven/">FineWoven</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/finewoven-accessories-may-get-one-last-season/">FineWoven Accessories May Get One Last Outing Before Apple Pulls Plug</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/finewoven-accessories-may-get-one-last-outing-before-apple-pulls-plug.2424730/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Meta Expands VR Operating System to Third-Party Hardware Makers</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Facebook parent company Meta <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/">today announced</a> the upcoming expansion of Meta Horizon OS, a virtual and augmented reality operating system that will be available to third-party hardware manufacturers that want to design their own headsets.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg" alt="" width="1385" height="779" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914163" /><br/>
Right now, Meta sells the Quest line of headsets, but the company wants to provide the software for third-party VR and AR products in the future, much like Microsoft offers Windows for all manner of third-party PCs.<br/>
<br/>
Meta Horizon OS is the mixed reality operating system that Meta created for its own Quest headsets, and it has support for eye, face, hand, and body tracking along with passthrough, spatial anchors, scene understanding, and other features. There is a "social layer" that will allow the identities, avatars, and friends of users to move between virtual spaces on different devices.<br/>
<br/>
According to Meta, multiple companies are working on devices that will use Meta Horizon OS. ASUS ROG is developing a performance gaming headset and Lenovo is working on mixed reality devices for productivity, learning, and entertainment. Meta says that it is also creating a limited edition version of Meta Quest in partnership with Xbox.<br/>
<br/>
With the expansion of Meta Horizon OS to third-party hardware manufacturers, Meta is making it easier for any developer to ship VR software on the platform by removing barriers between the Horizon Store and App Lab.<br/>
<br/>
By creating an operating system that can be used by other hardware manufacturers, Meta is inserting itself into the growing AR/VR ecosystem and creating opportunities for it to outpace Apple in mixed reality development. Apple launched the Vision Pro headset earlier this year, but software is lacking given the high price and limited distribution of the device.<br/>
<br/>
According to a report from earlier today, interest in the Vision Pro is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/">already waning</a> at Apple's retail locations with fewer people requesting demos.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/meta-expands-vr-operating-system/">Meta Expands VR Operating System to Third-Party Hardware Makers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-expands-vr-operating-system-to-third-party-hardware-makers.2424702/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/ceiling-lights/skylight/">Nanoleaf Skylight Smarter Kit</a> is Nanoleaf's first hardwired, permanent light, and it's also the first light that Nanoleaf designed specifically to be installed on ceilings.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/nanoleaf-skylight.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878921" /><br/>
As with Nanoleaf Light Panels, the Skylight is modular. A 3-panel starter kit is priced at &#36;250, and each add-on panel is &#36;70. Nanoleaf sells kits with more panels at a discount, so cost can go as low as &#36;62 per panel for a design that uses 12 panels.<br/>
<br/>
Ceiling lights come in a wide range of prices and &#36;250 is in the mid to high range, but there aren't many modular ceiling light options (as in hardwired with no visible cord), and none that I'm aware of that are both smart and offer multicolor and white lighting. Each square-shaped panel is made from a translucent white plastic that diffuses the light coming from the LEDs underneath.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-light-panels-components.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947489" /><br/>
The panels are just under 12 inches on each side, and they're about two inches thick. The plastic is a shinier material than the plastic used for the regular Nanoleaf Light Panels, and it just looks like white squares on the ceiling when the lights are not turned on. I don't mind the plastic because it blends well with a white ceiling when the lights are off. Square-shaped light panels have a modern vibe both on and off, and it isn't an aesthetic that's going to fit in with all decor styles.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-light-panels-ff.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947488" /><br/>
Every panel is 1400 lumens, so the three panel kit is 4200 lumens. The amount of light needed to properly light a space is going to depend on the size of the area being lit and the desired brightness, but that should be enough light for a 15x15 room with 10 foot ceilings. I was impressed with the brightness of the Skylight panels, and three installed in my laundry room was more light than I'll ever need. I ultimately included two more panels for a total of five, but that was because I was replacing a fluorescent panel with popcorn texture underneath and I didn't want to have to repair the ceiling. I think my laundry room is now the brightest room in the house, and I use the lights dimmed down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-skylight-bright.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947491" /><br/>
The Skylight can be installed by an electrician or as a DIY project with some basic electrical knowledge, and Nanoleaf does provide instructions and a video for completing the entire process. Creating a layout is the first step, and while the lights can be installed at angles and staggered, I did a straight line of five panels in a row. There's a ceiling plate that's screwed into the ceiling first, and the wires from the ceiling are connected to the main panel (with the breaker off of course). The panels are each two pieces, with a base that houses the LEDs and wires, and a cover.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-skylight-pastels.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947490" /><br/>
There's a single Main Controller panel that can control up to 99 additional dependent panels, and that's the one that goes up first. Nanoleaf included four screw holes on each panel that also serve as guides so you can mark on the ceiling where to drill, and drywall anchors and screws are included.<br/>
<br/>
Every panel has a terminal block that's covered by a panel that has to be unscrewed to get to the wires to connect one panel to another, and each panel is secured at all four corners, plus the wires are routed through holes at the sides. It's not difficult, exactly, but there are a lot of steps to go through, and it's frustrating working from below. I do think the guide holes helped a lot ensuring everything was lined up, and it ultimately turned out well.<br/>
<br/>
I think four drywall screws for every panel is a <em>lot</em>, especially because these panels aren't particularly heavy. In hindsight, I probably could have used two at a diagonal, and it's worth noting that there are going to be a lot of holes to repair in the ceiling if you install these panels and later want to remove them.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-skylight-pinks.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947492" /><br/>
Once installed, the Skylight works like any other HomeKit-connected light. It's added to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> with a &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; code, and setup is quick. Nanoleaf products only work with 2.4GHz networks, so you're going to need a setup that allows for a 2.4GHz connection. The Skylight is Wi-Fi only, but there it has Thread compatibility that can presumably be turned on if Nanoleaf decides to do so. It is not Matter-enabled.<br/>
<br/>
I don't own a single smart home product that does not occasionally have a connectivity issue, including Nanoleaf devices. When I got these panels, I debated installing the panels in my living room with vaulted ceilings (note: these can be installed on angled ceilings), but I was worried about access for troubleshooting because I'd need a tall, heavy ladder, so I tested the Skylight in one of my only rooms with lower ceilings.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-skylight-blues.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947493" /><br/>
I'm glad I did, because about a week after the Skylight was up, it lost connectivity. No amount of turning the power off or restarting my devices helped, and I had to get out a small ladder, pull off the main panel's cover, and long press the reset button to start over. I haven't had another disconnect, and it could have been caused by trying to use a motion sensor (I could NOT get it to work reliably and I haven't wanted to try again) or by turning the light off at the switch overnight, but it can happen.<br/>
<br/>
So far the Skylight doesn't seem to be less reliable than other Wi-Fi &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; devices or other Nanoleaf panels, but since it's on the ceiling it is decidedly more of a hassle to reset, which is something to keep in mind. I have also seen some complaints about Nanoleaf's customer service on Reddit and on Facebook, and while I haven't had a catastrophic product failure requiring help, I know some people have had issues getting support and replacements. Note that those complaints are more focused on the light panels than the Skylights, but I don't want to ignore potential customer service issues that could be a problem for some.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-skylight-brights.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947494" /><br/>
Each Skylight panel can be individually controlled with the Nanoleaf app and set to a different color or combination of colors and patterns. There are pre-designed options, plus tools for creating custom designs, and a section for downloading designs created by other Nanoleaf users.<br/>
<br/>
The Skylight has some unique pre-created patterns like Sun Shower and Shooting Stars that work particularly well on the ceiling, and there are window-style scenes like Blue Skies. The LEDs support 16 million colors and shades of white ranging from blue to yellow, plus there are more than 10 lighting patterns to use to shift between colors. There's also a rhythm feature that changes the color of the lights based on music or sound, and a fun AI option that creates a scene based on a typed phrase like "ocean waves" or "pink sunset."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-ai-scenes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947495" /><br/>
Colors on the light look best when in motion, and for some shades, there are dark and light spots that cause some unevenness. If you've used Nanoleaf's light panels on the wall, it's a similar effect, but it's something that you get used to and notice less with ceiling lights.<br/>
<br/>
I think multicolored lighting works well for accent lights, but I am less sure of it for light that provides as much illumination as the Skylight does. Setting the Skylight to a color like red, for example, means the room is <strong>RED</strong> and not outfitted with a tasteful red accent light in one area. Patterns that shift quickly can be almost overwhelming, and I don't like the music feature with the Skylight for that reason. I prefer to set the Skylight to softer, more pastel hues and warm whites, but it can definitely provide the ultimate mood lighting and set ambiance for movies and video games.<br/>
<br/>
There's one other thing that I want to mention before wrapping up this review, and that's control. This is a ceiling light that is connected to a light switch, and I don't have a good way to turn that light switch into a smart switch that can be used for changing colors, dimming, or even turning the light on and off. Nanoleaf doesn't have a switch, and there are a limited number of full light switch replacements for a situation like this.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-app-interface.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1984" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947496" /><br/>
I have a Lutron Caseta hub and system, but adding a Lutron smart light switch isn't a good idea because the Nanoleaf Skylight needs a constant connection and it's not an on/off situation. There are plenty of smart buttons, but nothing that seems to be designed to replace a light switch. For Hue lights, I solve this issue with the Lutron Aurora Dimmer Switches, but those are designed to work with the Hue app and not &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; in general. I need a physical button for the Skylight that also prevents the existing switch from being flipped, and I'm not sure how to solve that issue right now.<br/>
<br/>
Nanoleaf does have Sense+ smart switches that it has been working on since 2023, but I'm not sure when these are set to come out.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
Nanoleaf's Skylight is expensive and not without flaws, but it's also a one-of-a-kind product. It's modular so you can tune the number of panels to fit your space, it supports white and yellow light along with any color of the rainbow, and there are endless scenes and effects to play with.<br/>
<br/>
The Skylight's design isn't going to resonate with everyone, but for those who want a modern feel and who love color, it's worth checking out.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2><br/>
The Skylight was popular enough that it sold out in most places. Nanoleaf <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/ceiling-lights/skylight/?category=skylight&amp;pack=smarter-kit&amp;size=3">has a sign up to get a notification</a> when it's back in stock, but it is still <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNanoleaf-Ceiling-Lights-Skylight-Smarter%2Fdp%2FB0CRXXPCN2%2Fref%3Dasc_df_B0CRXXPCN2%2F">available from Amazon</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nanoleaf/">Nanoleaf</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/nanoleaf-skylight/">Review: Nanoleaf&#039;s Skylight Adds Modular Smart Lighting to Your Ceiling</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-nanoleafs-skylight-adds-modular-smart-lighting-to-your-ceiling.2424700/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Oppo Find X7 Ultra's camera has <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/smartphones/#sort-camera/segments-%5B%22ultra%22%5D/device-Oppo%20Find%20X7%20Ultra">one of the highest rankings</a> on camera site DXOMark, coming in well ahead of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max. For that reason, we thought we'd compare the Oppo Find X7 Ultra to Apple's flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to see how the cameras actually measure up in real life.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="#1 Ranked Camera vs iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKSvQj8AkLY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The Oppo Find X7 Ultra has a 50-megapixel main lens, a 50-megapixel wide-angle lens, and two 50-megapixel telephoto lenses, one of which is a 3x periscope lens. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max has a 48-megapixel Main lens with multiple focal lengths, a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens that supports 5x optical zoom. In terms of hardware, the main cameras are similar, but the Oppo has higher resolution options for the telephoto and wide-angle lenses.<br/>
<br/>
We shared a series of photos from each smartphone on our social media channels, without mentioning which one was the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. When we asked which images people liked better, our poll favored the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but overall, most people liked some images from the Oppo and some images from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. No surprises there, as with high-end smartphones, differences in camera quality can be miniscule. Choosing a favorite often comes down to processing done by each smartphone, and picking an image based on the look comes down to personal preference.<br/>
<br/>
For standard main camera photos taken during the daytime, the images come out almost the same. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can sometimes seem a little more washed out because it loses some of the saturation when raising highlights, while the Oppo tends to be more saturated. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; images can be brighter, which is preferable to some people, but the Oppo features more vibrant colors in a lot of shots. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sometimes boosts the warmth, and again, that's something that some people prefer.<br/>
<br/>
For night shots, the Oppo images came out better for the most part. The nighttime colors were more true to life, and there were fewer issues with reflections and flare. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; raised the brightness of some areas of nighttime shots just a little too much, though a couple of the low light images came out better because of some of the low light processing features Apple has built into the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
For telephoto images and Portrait images, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; had the edge in terms of focus and color, though the photos were sometimes softer than the Oppo's shots.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working to secure an exclusive TV deal with soccer governing organization FIFA, reports <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/business/fifa-apple-tv-deal.html">The New York Times</a></em>. FIFA will launch a revamped version of Club World Cup in 2025, and Apple wants the TV rights. Club World Cup 2025 will feature 32 teams from each of the six confederations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/fifa.jpg" alt="" width="1535" height="863" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947662" /><br/>
An agreement between Apple and FIFA could be announced as soon as this month, and the first tournament will take place in the United States next summer. Apple could be paying around &#36;1 billion, and <em>The New York Times</em> says it is not yet clear if there will be any free-to-air rights. If not, the entire tournament could be available only to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already shelled out &#36;2.5 billion to secure global broadcasting rights to Major League Soccer. MLS and League Cup games are streamed on &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj;, with access priced at &#36;14.99 per month or &#36;99 per season for non-subscribers and &#36;12.99 per month or &#36;79 per season for those who subscribe to &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple sees live sports as a way to lure new customers to the &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; streaming service. In addition to the MLS deal, it has also secured a deal with Major League Baseball. Apple negotiated for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/19/apple-quits-nfl-sunday-ticket-negotiations/">NFL Sunday Ticket access</a>, and while that didn't work out, a report from <em><a href="https://theathletic.com/5430093/2024/04/22/nba-tv-rights-amazon-nbc/">The Athletic</a></em> suggests that Apple is still in the running to secure some streaming access to NBA games.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Apple introduced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-hands-on/">dedicated Apple Sports app</a> that allows users to get real-time scores and stats for their favorite teams. The app is able to sync with the My Sports experience in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fifa/">FIFA</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-sports/">Apple Sports</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-fifa-tournament-rights/">Apple Working to Secure Streaming Rights to FIFA Club World Cup</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-to-secure-streaming-rights-to-fifa-club-world-cup.2424683/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has acquired the Paris-based artificial intelligence startup Datakalab amid its push to deliver on-device AI tools.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840591" /><br/>
Datakalab specializes in algorithm compression and embedded AI systems. The acquisition, finalized on December 17 last year, was quietly conducted but noted in a European Commission filing spotted by French publication <em><a href="https://www.challenges.fr/high-tech/ia-apple-rachete-la-start-up-parisienne-datakalab_890773">Challenges</a></em> (via <em><a href="https://iphonesoft.fr/2024/04/22/apple-rachete-start-up-francaise-datakalab-specialisee-ia-embarquee">iPhoneSoft</a></em>). While the financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed, the move is almost certainly part of Apple's broader strategy to bring more sophisticated AI technology to its devices, such as those expected to be introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The company was established in 2016 by Xavier and Lucas Fischer and made significant strides in AI technology focusing on low-power, high-efficiency deep learning algorithms that function without relying on cloud-based systems. This approach aligns with Apple's oft-touted commitment to user privacy, data security, and reliable performance, as processing data locally minimizes the risk of data breaches and ensures faster processing times. The startup's expertise in compressing neural networks to work effectively on portable devices like smartphones and tablets is likely a key factor in Apple's interest.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> recently reported that Apple's LLM <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-working-on-on-device-llm/">will run entirely on-device</a>, rather than via the cloud like most existing AI services.  Apple's AI tools may be less capable in certain instances than its direct cloud-based rivals, but Gurman suggested that the company could "fill in the gaps" by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-google-gemini-ios-18-iphone/">licensing technology from Google</a> and other AI service providers. <br/>
<br/>
Before its acquisition, Datakalab engaged in various high-profile projects, including collaborations with the French government and Disney. The company developed technology capable of analyzing human emotions by facial recognition and visual data, which were later used to monitor audience reactions in real-time during cinema screenings. The first look at Apple's new AI strategy is widely anticipated to arrive alongside previews of its next-generation operating systems at WWDC in early June.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/france/">France</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-acquires-french-ai-company/">Apple Acquires French AI Company Specializing in On-Device Processing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-acquires-french-ai-company-specializing-in-on-device-processing.2424672/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Retail stock of the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> is starting to dwindle ahead of the widely anticipated arrival of new models early next month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-21/apple-aapl-growth-opportunities-southeast-asia-and-africa-lower-end-iphone-lv9itkna?">Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPad-Air-5-Colors-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1494" height="840" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-941843" /><br/>
Citing sources at multiple retail stores in the latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-21/apple-aapl-growth-opportunities-southeast-asia-and-africa-lower-end-iphone-lv9itkna?">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman said that inventory levels of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; are diminishing in Apple stores, a typical indicator that new versions are soon to be released. Unlike the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> apparently remains abundantly available, which suggests that Apple might be planning to sell through its current stock even after introducing an upgraded model. Historically, Apple has managed its inventory to align with the release cycles of its products, reducing shipments of older units to make room for the latest offerings. <br/>
<br/>
Expected changes coming to the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; include the more powerful <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip and an additional 12.9-inch display size option, while the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is rumored to receive OLED display technology, the M3 chip, and new accessories.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has ordered a large number of capacitative button components from a Taiwan supplier that are allegedly for use in the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> series, claims a new report out of Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/unbox-therapy-15-buttons.jpg" alt="" width="2842" height="1572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895008" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: Unbox Therapy</em></div><br/>
According to the <em><a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/11162/7914175">Economic Daily News</a></em>, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering won the order, which is said to include system-in-a-package (SIP) modules that will be used to integrate capcative components with two Taptic Engine motors, one on either side of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The claim in the report is that Apple will replace the existing physical buttons on both sides of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> with capacitive versions that will provide &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; users with haptic feedback. The latter type of button detects pressure and emulates the press of a physical button via a haptic (or Taptic) engine which generates vibrations. <br/>
<br/>
Apple may well have ordered the buttons in preparation for future production plans, but this does not necessarily mean that they are destined for use in this year's &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models. <br/>
<br/>
The earliest known prototypes of the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;‌ were thought to include haptic power and volume buttons. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-haptic-button-overview/">Project Bongo</a>, as it was known internally, was a redesign of the volume and power buttons on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. However, it was scrapped in 2023 following unresolved technical issues, according to <em>MacRumors</em>' sources. After the cancelation of the Bongo project, Apple moved back to mechanical buttons for the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;‌.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, most rumors suggest that &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will have all-mechanical buttons, and this includes the rumored addition of a fourth button. According to <em>The Information</em>, Apple will add a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">Capture Button</a>" to all &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, but the button is expected to be mechanical rather than capacitive, and yet it will be able to respond to pressure and touch. <br/>
<br/>
The button will be used for taking photos and videos, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users will reportedly be able to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus with a light press, and activate a recording with a more forceful press.<br/>
<br/>
Today's report claims the capacitive components will enter volume production in the third quarter of this year, which is unusually late in terms of Apple's typical initial &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; production run, so the order may be for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 lineup rather than this year's upcoming models. That said, as we saw with the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;‌ series, things can change fairly far into the process, so watch this space.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/udn-com/">Economic Daily News</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-orders-capactive-butttons-iphone-16/">Apple Orders Capacitive Button Components Allegedly for iPhone 16</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-orders-capacitive-button-components-allegedly-for-iphone-16.2424660/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, Apple's &#36;3,500 spatial computing device, appears to be following a pattern familiar to the AR/VR headset industry – initial enthusiasm giving way to a significant dip in sustained interest and usage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-vision-pro-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944159" /><br/>
Since its debut in the U.S. in February 2024, excitement for the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; has noticeably cooled, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-21/apple-aapl-growth-opportunities-southeast-asia-and-africa-lower-end-iphone-lv9itkna">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman reports a marked decline in the demand for retail demos and sales, based on the Apple Stores he has spoken to:<br/>
<blockquote>Demand for demos is way down. People who do book appointments often don't show up, and sales — at least at some locations — have gone from a couple of units a day to just a handful in a whole week. Apple also has had to step up the marketing on its online homepage. There's a huge promo for the Vision Pro at the top of the website — the most aggressive pitch since the device went on sale in early February.</blockquote>The trend that &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; appears to be following is less likely to be a retail anomaly, and more indicative of a broader issue that has plagued VR technology from its inception: Maintaining user engagement after the initial novelty wears off. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman offers his personal experience of Apple's headset as a microcosm of what he suspects is a wider user trend. His own usage has decreased from daily interactions to just once or twice a week. A significant barrier to more frequent use, he says, is a setup that involves attaching batteries, booting up, and navigating a complex interface, which makes traditional devices like laptops and smartphones more appealing for regular tasks. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman also blames the Vision Pro's lack of a "killer app" and compelling content for further diminishing the headset's appeal. He notes that it feels better suited to solitary activities – say, on a long flight or while working from home – rather than for use in social situations or around co-workers.<br/>
<br/>
It seems Apple still has a considerable task ahead in evolving the Vision Pro into a device that redefines everyday technology use. In the meantime, several bugs that initially plagued <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> have been resolved, although many of Apple's own apps are still not optimized for the device's operating system.<br/>
<br/>
In the last &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update, Apple added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/testing-vision-pro-spatial-persona/">Spatial Personas</a>, which make it feel like you are in the same virtual room as another Vision Pro user. Spatial Personas can be used for watching movies and TV shows together, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> and other video calls, using apps like Freeform, playing games, and more. However, the feature needs other Vision Pro owners to appreciate it, and as Gurman notes, they are still few and far between. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to produce fewer than 400,000 Vision Pro headsets in 2024 due to the complexity of manufacturing, according to analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. However, Apple is said to be already working on a new version of the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; for 2025 that will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/gurman-apple-vision-pro-2-at-least-18-months-away/">priced more affordably</a>. Meanwhile, the first incarnation of the headset is expected to arrive in additional countries later this year. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/">Apple Vision Pro Customer Interest Dying Down at Some Retail Stores</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down-at-some-retail-stores.2424651/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has stopped production of FineWoven accessories, according to the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-FineWoven.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913676" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1782025156292198751">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Kosutami explained that Apple has stopped production of FineWoven accessories due to its poor durability. The company may move to another non-leather material for its premium accessories in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Kosutami has revealed accurate information about FineWoven accessories in the past. The leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/new-apple-watch-magnetic-band/">unveiled</a> Apple's plans to introduce new Apple Watch bands made of a "woven fabric material" over a month before they debuted, as well as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/finewoven-cases-may-match-new-watch-band/">matching iPhone cases</a>. Kosutami also revealed the very <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/exclusive-first-look-finewoven-apple-watch-band/">first images of FineWoven accessories</a> shortly before the event in which they were officially announced. <em>MacRumors</em> understands the source of this latest information regarding the cessation of production to be the same as these previous FineWoven rumors that were ultimately accurate, so it should be taken seriously until we know more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">stopped selling leather accessories</a> in September last year, replacing them with a more environmentally friendly "FineWoven" material that the company describes as "luxurious and durable microtwill" made from 68% post-consumer recycled polyester. FineWoven <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> cases are priced at &#36;59, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> Wallets at &#36;59, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> holders at &#36;35, and Apple Watch bands at &#36;99.<br/>
<br/>
Accessories made of the material have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">very poorly received by customers</a>, citing poor durability and disappointing quality. FineWoven accessories in new color options were noticeably absent from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-refreshes-cases-and-watch-bands/">Apple's spring refresh</a>. If Apple has indeed stopped production of FineWoven accessories, it may be some time before the company's existing stock inventory begins to noticeably deplete. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/finewoven/">FineWoven</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-reportedly-stops-finewoven-production/">Apple Reportedly Stops Production of FineWoven Accessories</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-stops-production-of-finewoven-accessories.2424610/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is developing its own large language model (LLM) that runs on-device to prioritize speed and privacy, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-21/apple-aapl-growth-opportunities-southeast-asia-and-africa-lower-end-iphone-lv9itkna?">Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840591" /><br/>
Writing in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-21/apple-aapl-growth-opportunities-southeast-asia-and-africa-lower-end-iphone-lv9itkna?">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman said that Apple's LLM underpins upcoming generative AI features. "All indications" apparently suggests that it will run entirely on-device, rather than via the cloud like most existing AI services.<br/>
<br/>
Since they will run on-device, Apple's AI tools may be less capable in certain instances than its direct cloud-based rivals, but Gurman suggested that the company could "fill in the gaps" by licensing technology from Google and other AI service providers. Last month, Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-google-gemini-ios-18-iphone/">reported</a> that Apple was in discussions with Google to integrate its Gemini AI engine into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. The main advantages of on-device processing will be quicker response times and superior privacy compared to cloud-based solutions. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's marketing strategy for its AI technology will apparently be based around how it can be useful to users' daily lives, rather than its power. Apple's broader AI strategy is expected to be revealed alongside previews of its major software updates at WWDC in June.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-working-on-on-device-llm/">Gurman: Apple Working on On-Device LLM for Generative AI Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-working-on-on-device-llm-for-generative-ai-features.2424609/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Likely Planning to Skip M3 Mac Mini for M4 Refresh in Late 2024</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is likely to skip an M3 version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> in favor of a bigger update with M4 chips toward the end of the year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-21/apple-aapl-growth-opportunities-southeast-asia-and-africa-lower-end-iphone-lv9itkna?">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-Mac-Mini-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-946149" /><br/>
In the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-21/apple-aapl-growth-opportunities-southeast-asia-and-africa-lower-end-iphone-lv9itkna?">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman explained that he does not expect Apple to refresh the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; with M3 chips. Apple last updated the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/new-m2-m2-pro-mac-mini/">in January 2023</a>. Other new features included two extra Thunderbolt 4 ports and an HDMI 2.1 port for &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro configurations, Wi-Fi 6E support with a compatible router, and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously said that Apple is planning to release new &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; models with M4 and M4 Pro chips "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/when-are-m4-macs-launching/">between the end of 2024 and early 2025</a>." Now, he has clarified that with new Mac minis arriving as soon as the end of the year, there is not sufficient "room for M3 models to come out before then, so it's probably safe to say that those Mac desktops will skip the M3 generation."<br/>
<br/>
Such a move would not be unprecedented since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> skipped the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip entirely, holding off until a bigger performance bump with the M3 chip late last year. With the M4 chip series, the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; should get a significant CPU performance improvement compared to the existing models with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; series. The M4 chips are also rumored to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">faster Neural Engine</a> for artificial intelligence tasks.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macs/">M4 Macs</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-likely-planning-to-skip-m3-mac-mini/">Apple Likely Planning to Skip M3 Mac Mini for M4 Refresh in Late 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-planning-to-skip-m3-mac-mini-for-m4-refresh-in-late-2024.2424607/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
