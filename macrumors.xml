		<description><![CDATA[Apple has been gradually expanding its suite of satellite connectivity features for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> brings a significant new one in the form of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/you-can-send-texts-via-satellite-in-ios-18/">Messages via satellite</a>. The feature allows users to send and receive iMessages and SMS texts, including emoji and Tapbacks, while out of range of cellular and Wi-Fi networks.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v30z-0bGbHQ?si=aezmpIgfkSqxhKAL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<em>CNET</em> met up with Apple's senior director of platform product marketing, Kurt Knight, this week for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v30z-0bGbHQ">early first look at how the feature works</a>, while iJustine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZMqOATNXE">offered a similar walkthrough</a> of it.<br/>
<br/>
When your phone detects it's out of range of terrestrial networks, you'll get a pop-up alert that offers quick access to all of the available satellite-enabled services including Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and now Messages.<br/>
<br/>
Messages via satellite can also be accessed directly from the Messages app when off the terrestrial grid, with iOS popping up a card to help you point your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; toward an available satellite. From there, it works just as a normal Messages conversation does, and you're able to send and receive messages, emoji, and Tapbacks. Conversation messages sent via iMessage are also end-to-end encrypted when sent via satellite.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BZMqOATNXE?si=ja5yD4WiskPg-Vgq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
iMessages can be sent freely back and forth via satellite, but there are limitations on SMS due to the volume of promotional and automated messages that come through that protocol. Your emergency contacts and specified family members will be able to contact you via SMS at any time, but for all other contacts, you will need to send the first SMS message via satellite, which will then allow them to respond for a period of time.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, despite Rich Communication Services (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>) support coming in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; later this year, Messages via satellite will not initially work with &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;. Knight says the &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; protocol has not yet been optimized to a small enough size to work over a satellite connection, at least as far as Apple is concerned. <br/>
<br/>
As with Apple's other satellite services, Messages via satellite will launch initially only in the United States with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; before later expanding to other countries. Apple's satellite services work on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and later, and while Apple has indicated it will eventually charge for satellite services, it continues to offer them without charge for the time being.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/satellite/">Satellite</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-messages-via-satellite-first-look/">First Look at Messages via Satellite in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-look-at-messages-via-satellite-in-ios-18.2429147/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week previewed a new system that will allow iPhone users who update to iOS 18 to use Apple Pay in any desktop web browser, such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others. The computer running the browser can even be a Windows PC.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Pay-Code-Scan-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955376" /><br/>
Any website that implements the latest version of Apple Pay will support this new system. When a customer checks out with Apple Pay in a desktop browser other than Safari, a code will appear on the screen that can be scanned in the Camera app on an iPhone running iOS 18 or later, allowing them to complete the purchase on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Pay-Code-Scan-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955377" /><br/>
Apple provided more details about this system in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10108/">WWDC 2024 coding session</a> released today. It will take time for website developers to adopt the latest Apple Pay SDK, so this feature will not be widely available on the web right away.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Pay on the desktop web was previously limited to Safari on a Mac, so this is a much-awaited expansion of the feature to more browsers and devices.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is currently in beta, and it should be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-apple-pay-in-any-desktop-browser/">iOS 18 Enables You to Use Apple Pay With Chrome and More on Desktop</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-enables-you-to-use-apple-pay-with-chrome-and-more-on-desktop.2429140/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a few discounts across popular Apple accessories, including the AirTag and Apple Pencil. We're also tracking a few discounts on Eufy's own Bluetooth tracking accessories, the SmartTrack Link, which are slightly more affordable than the AirTag.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/airtag-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940079" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the AirTag, you can get the 4 Pack of trackers for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0932QJ2JZ"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;99.00. This is a solid second-best price on the accessory, and just about &#36;5 higher than the all-time low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0932QJ2JZ"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;19 OFF</div>AirTag 4 Pack for &#36;79.99</div></a></div><h2>Eufy</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/eufy-smartrack-link.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955367" /><br/>
<br/>
Anyone who needs a Bluetooth tracker but wants to save a bit of money should look at Anker's Eufy brand of trackers, which are on sale on Amazon right now and compatible with Find My on Apple devices. These start at just &#36;15.99 for one tracker and raise to &#36;48.99 for a 4 Pack. Eufy also has a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BKJZ5BVF%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.21TJMGTITJI3Q%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.21TJMGTITJI3Q_1718290256476">SmartTrack Card</a>, but right now there is no deal on that tracker.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B8GDXPBL%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.F587O4DYC8XW%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.F587O4DYC8XW_1718290050279"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;4 OFF</div>SmartTrack Link 1 Pack for &#36;15.99</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
If you're shopping for an Apple Pencil, Amazon has multiple models on sale this week. The biggest discount can be found on the Apple Pencil 2 at &#36;50 off, but you can also find sales on the newer Apple Pencil with USB-C from 2023 and the Apple Pencil Pro.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple did not mention CarPlay during its WWDC keynote this week, but iOS 18 includes a handful of new features for the in-car software.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955334" /><br/>
Overall, there is not a whole lot new for CarPlay on iOS 18, with changes seemingly limited to the Messages and Settings apps so far.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap everything new for CarPlay on iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New for CarPlay on iOS 18</h2><br/>
<h3>1. Contact Photos in Messages App</h3><br/>
iOS 18 adds contact photos next to names in the Messages app, making it easier to identify conversations at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955330" /><br/>
The contact photos are also visible in Messages app notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-4.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955327" /><br/>
<h3>2. Silent Mode Settings</h3><br/>
In the Settings app, you can now choose to have Silent mode on your iPhone automatically turn on or off when the device is connected to CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-5.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955326" /><br/>
<h3>3. Color Filters</h3><br/>
Apple has expanded Color Filters to CarPlay. This accessibility feature can help individuals with color blindness to differentiate colors on the CarPlay interface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-3.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955328" /><br/>
There is a grayscale option and three other color filters available to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955329" /><br/>
<h3>4. Voice Control</h3><br/>
Voice Control is another new accessibility feature that allows you to control CarPlay entirely with Siri voice commands through a connected iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-7.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955324" /><br/>
<h3>5. Sound Recognition</h3><br/>
Sound Recognition is expanding to CarPlay to provide notifications for driving-related sounds, such as car horns and sirens. This feature can be especially beneficial to drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CarPlay-Sound-Recognition.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="718" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950848" /><br/>
We did not see Sound Recognition in the CarPlay settings on iOS 18 beta 1. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
Apple shared some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-next-generation-carplay-images/">updated next-generation CarPlay images</a> during WWDC 2024, revealing new Vehicle, Media, and Climate apps on the screen for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Next-generation CarPlay will be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to uniquely match their vehicles. Apple revealed a variety of different design options and layouts that will be available to automakers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-2.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954801" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's special episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wwdc-2024-recap-live-from-apple-park/id1602394741?i=1000658909505">The MacRumors Show</a> from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a>, we look at all of the major updates coming to Apple's operating systems later this year and Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>

Monday's keynote event was insane, and jam-packed with an overwhelming number of AI features that are going to change the way we use Apple devices. We were able to visit the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> studio for the day just after the event to discuss what's in store. <br/>
<br/>
We take a look at Apple Intelligence, which is what Apple calls the AI capabilities coming to almost every app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>. Apple is focusing on practical tools that drastically improve the functionality of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, help you write and edit, and cut down on the little hassles in life. It's not all business, though, and there are some fun image and emoji generating tools that we go over, along with a surprising partnership with OpenAI that lets &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; loop in ChatGPT for requests. <br/>
<br/>
We also get into the new &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> design options, the revamped Control Center, and the features coming to Messages, plus we delve into the changes that Apple is making in iPadOS 18, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2, and watchOS 11. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[First introduced in April, spatial Personas in Apple Vision Pro are designed to feel as if they are in the same physical space, and to enhance the experience, the lifelike avatars will soon be able to interact directly with each other using some new gestures in visionOS 2.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Spatial-Persona-Apple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944483" /><br/>
Previewed at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/vision-pro-spatial-personas/">WWDC last year</a>, spatial Personas allow Vision Pro users to "break out of the familiar FaceTime tile and feel more present, like they are gathered in the same physical space," according to Apple. They feature a transparent background and are able to show body language and additional movement such as hand gestures for a more lifelike experience.<br/>
<br/>
As shared by indie developer <a href="https://x.com/xchester16/status/1800912216843321553">xChester on social media</a>, spatial Personas in the same Environment can now high five, fist bump and touch fingers, and the visionOS 2 beta provides visual and audio feedback to highlight the virtual interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in visionOS 2, spatial Personas can be invoked in the Photos app via SharePlay, allowing Vision Pro users to enjoy their panoramas, spatial videos, and more — all while feeling like everyone is in the same physical space.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Persona in visionOS now has both visual and sound feedback when people doing high five, fist bumping or finger touching. <br>Tried them out with <a href="https://twitter.com/Chill_VR_Jeff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Chill_VR_Jeff</a> and it&#39;s really fun.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWDC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/visionOS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#visionOS</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VisionPro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VisionPro</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Apple</a> <a href="https://t.co/KtIkwgHMHP">pic.twitter.com/KtIkwgHMHP</a></p>&mdash; xChester ᯅ (@xchester16) <a href="https://twitter.com/xchester16/status/1800912216843321553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
visionOS 2 is also giving developers more control over spatial Personas that will allow them to fine-tune the placement of Personas in their app, enabling new shared experiences in games, for example. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-releases-visionos-1-2/">visionOS‌ 1.2</a> earlier this week, and the update adds Persona improvements such as improved hair and makeup appearance, as well as better rendering for Eyesight.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/visionos-1-2-spatial-persona-interactive-gestures/">visionOS 2: Spatial Personas Can Touch Fingers, High Five, Fist Bump Each Other With Visual and Audio Feedback</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/visionos-2-spatial-personas-can-touch-fingers-high-five-fist-bump-each-other-with-visual-and-audio-feedback.2429109/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Introduced in iOS 16, Live Activities changed the way users interact with their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Instead of getting multiple notifications when tracking a delivery or a sports score, for example, users see a single, dynamically updating Live Activity with real-time information right on their Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/live-activities-watchos-11.jpg" alt="" width="2510" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955298" /><br/>
Starting in watchOS 11, when a Live Activity begins on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, it now automatically shows on your Apple Watch at the top of the Smart Stack, allowing you to keep tabs on it just by raising your wrist. (Notably, Apple has also made it so that the design of clock at the top of the Smart Stack aligns with your current watch face.)<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch users will know that the Smart Stack is usually accessed from the watch face by turning the Digital Crown. But in watchOS 11, the Smart Stack can now open automatically when a Live Activity starts, and will remain visible when you lower your wrist. <br/>
<br/>
When you tap on the Live Activity, it opens the relevant app, and if there's no associated Apple Watch app, it turns into a convenient fullscreen view with a button to open the app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-13-at-11.34.15 AM.jpg" alt="" width="2505" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955299" /><br/>
If a Live Activity begins while you are in another Apple Watch app, it will appear in a special compact version at the bottom of the display. If you pull up on the compact view, it enlarges into the full widget, and if you tap on it, you'll be taken to the app or fullscreen view.<br/>
<br/>
In watchOS 11, Apple is also introducing "Suggested widgets," or widgets that the system intelligently adds or removes in the Smart Stack based on what's relevant in the moment. <br/>
<br/>
For example, if it's about to rain in 15 minutes, a new precipitation widget will appear in the Smart Stack ahead of time, and then disappear when the sky clears. Cues for suggested widgets can include location, date, sleep, fitness, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/shazam-widget-watchos-11.jpg" alt="" width="2509" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955300" /><br/>
Another example is the Shazam widget. It automatically appears in your Smart Stack when there's music playing around you so that you can use it to identify the song, and it will disappear when the music stops.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, Smart Stack widgets can now be interactive, and developers can bring toggles and switches into play, allowing users to perform quick actions without launching an app. An individual widget can be used to turn smart lights on and off, for example.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 11 is currently available to developers for testing purposes, with Apple planning to release the software to the public this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/watchos-11-live-activities-suggested-widgets/">watchOS 11: Smart Stack Gains Live Activities and Suggested Widgets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-smart-stack-gains-live-activities-and-suggested-widgets.2429105/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPadOS 18 Brings a New Customizable Tab Bar and Sidebar UI to Apps</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In iPadOS 18, Apple has redesigned the tab bar experience for many apps like Podcasts, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>. Previously in these apps, tabs sat at the bottom of the interface. When in portrait orientation however, tab bars now sit at the top of these apps to be closer to other navigation controls, while a customizable sidebar appears in landscape mode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tab-bar-ipados-18.jpg" alt="" width="2821" height="1408" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955290" /><br/>
In Apple apps other than the above, the tab bar appears in both portrait and landscape. Apple says having the tab bar at the top of the app and between other navigational controls reduces the amount of horizontal and vertical space used up by the interface, and allows users to focus more on the content. <br/>
<br/>
To accompany the new tab bars, sidebars in apps have been updated to help users navigate apps and provide quick access to top-level destinations. <br/>
<br/>
Together, side bars and tab bars support user customization, so it's now possible to drag and drop items from the sidebar into a pinned section on the tab bar for even quicker access to favorite content.<br/>
<br/>
Some items in the tab bar are, however, fixed. For example, in the TV app, the Home, TV+, MLS, and Store tabs are always available, and at the end of the pinned section, the search option remains a constant presence. It's worth noting that tab bars disappear when apps are in landscape orientation.<br/>
<br/>

Third-party developers have control over what appears in the new tab bar and sidebar, enabling them to determine what stays fixed, and what can be added or removed.<br/>
<br/>
The iPadOS 18 beta is available to developers at the current time, with Apple planning to introduce a public beta in July.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ipados-18-tab-bar-apps/">iPadOS 18 Brings a New Customizable Tab Bar and Sidebar UI to Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-18-brings-a-new-customizable-tab-bar-and-sidebar-ui-to-apps.2429100/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is adding Game Mode to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. A similar Game Mode was added to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> last year, and the same performance-enhancing features apply, according to Apple.<br/>

When enabled, Game Mode optimizes the gaming experience by giving the game the highest priority access to your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s processor, while lowering usage for background tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says Game Mode also improves the responsiveness of connected AirPods and game controllers by reducing input latency and audio latency.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing to set up with Game Mode – it turns on automatically when you launch a game or an app associated with a game, as indicated by a brief notification.<br/>

The feature is designed for AAA titles like <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em>. Capcom announced on Monday that Resident Evil 7 is coming to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Macs on July 2, providing another opportunity to see how the new Game Mode performs in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and iPadOS 18.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/game-mode/">Game Mode</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-game-mode-faster-iphone/">iOS 18&#039;s New Game Mode Makes iPhones Faster and More Responsive</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18s-new-game-mode-makes-iphones-faster-and-more-responsive.2429096/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside its Apple Intelligence feature set, Apple on Monday announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow Siri to access ChatGPT directly in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia to provide better responses in relevant situations. But according to a new <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/apple-to-pay-openai-for-chatgpt-through-distribution-not-cash">Bloomberg</a></em> report, nobody is paying cash to anybody for the arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/open-ai-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1093" height="615" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953560" /><br/>
From Mark Gurman's report:<br/>
<blockquote>Apple isn't paying OpenAI as part of the partnership, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal terms are private. Instead, Apple believes pushing OpenAI's brand and technology to hundreds of millions of its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments, these people said.</blockquote>Despite the agreement, the partnership for OpenAI could become expensive, as more and more Apple device users tap into ChatGPT's capabilities and suck up more of the company's compute power and budget. <br/>
<br/>
However, Gurman notes that OpenAI could profit from the deal by encouraging Apple users to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus for &#36;20 a month. If these users sign up through an Apple device, Apple may also be in a position to receive a commission. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Apple plans to increase its earnings from AI through revenue-sharing agreements with its partners. According to the report, Apple is already discussing offering Google's Gemini chatbot as an additional option, an agreement that should be in place later this year. <br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, Apple aims to take a portion of the revenue generated from monetizing chatbot results on its operating systems, anticipating that more users will rely on AI instead of search engines. Such a shift could eventually reduce the massive amounts of revenue Apple currently earns from its lucrative search deal with Google.<br/>
<br/>
The report notes that Apple has yet to reach a deal with a local Chinese provider to handle chatbot feature, but has been considering an arrangement with companies such as Baidu and Alibaba. To begin with, Apple Intelligence will only be available in U.S. English, with more languages set to be supported next year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/apple-not-paying-openai-chatgpt-ios-18/">Apple Reportedly Not Paying OpenAI to Use ChatGPT in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-not-paying-openai-to-use-chatgpt-in-ios-18.2429090/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tile, known for its Bluetooth tracking devices, was recently hacked, according to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/hacker-accesses-internal-tile-tool-that-provides-location-data-to-cops/">report from <em>404 Media</em></a>. A hacker was able to gain access to Tile's internal tools that are used for processing location data requests for law enforcement officers, and that gave the hacker customer names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/tile-sticker-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-797864" /><br/>
Data breaches are not uncommon these days, but Tile was not forthcoming about the attack and did not mention it until being contacted by <em>404 Media</em>. The site learned about the breach from the hacker. Tile parent company Life360 published a statement about the attack on its website after being prompted to do so by <em>404 Media</em>.<br/>
<blockquote>Similar to many other companies, Life360 recently became the victim of a criminal extortion attempt. We received emails from an unknown actor claiming to possess Tile customer information. We promptly initiated an investigation into the potential incident and detected unauthorized access to a Tile customer support platform (but not our Tile service platform). The potentially impacted data consists of information such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and Tile device identification numbers. It does not include more sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, passwords or log-in credentials, location data, or government-issued identification numbers, because the Tile customer support platform did not contain these information types.<br/>
<br/>
We believe this incident was limited to the specific Tile customer support data described above and is not more widespread. We take this event and the security of customer information seriously. We have taken and will continue to take steps designed to further protect our systems from bad actors, and we have reported this event and the extortion attempt to law enforcement. We remain committed to keeping families safe online and in the real world.</blockquote><br/>
While no location information was obtained, the incident is alarming because of the nature of the tool that the hacker was able to access. The hacker was able to get into Tile's system using credentials from a former Tile employee, and was able to get into a tool that could be used to look up Tile customers by phone number. Part of that tool allowed for searching location history.<br/>
<br/>
Tile told <em>404 Media</em> that the hacker would not have been able to access location data from the platform that was attacked, but did not confirm whether the hacker had the appropriate authentication to perform a location request once the internal tool was accessed.<br/>
<br/>
Tile is one of Apple's main competitors in the item tracking space, with Tile's trackers available as an alternative to Apple's AirTags.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/tile-hacked-customer-data-obtained/">Hackers Access Tile&#039;s Internal Tracking Tools, Customer Data</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hackers-access-tiles-internal-tracking-tools-customer-data.2429059/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The watchOS 11 update that Apple plans to release this fall offers several new widgets, including a built-in Shazam widget. Shazam has been able to be downloaded on the Apple Watch from the Apple Watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> or accessed via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, but it hasn't been available through the Smart Stack feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/shazam-for-mac.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857861" /><br/>
Apple plans to add a Shazam widget to Smart Stack with the watchOS 11 update, making it quicker to get to without &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; or downloading an app. You can access the Apple Watch Smart Stack by turning the Digital Crown.<br/>
<br/>
The Smart Stack is improving with the update, and widgets will be displayed based on time, location, and other factors, plus Live Activities are supported for keeping up with sports games or an approaching ride right from the wrist.<br/>
<br/>
Along with Shazam, other new Smart Stack widget additions include severe weather alerts, Translate, Training Load (a new watchOS 11 Workout feature), <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, and Distance. watchOS 11 is currently available to developers for testing purposes, with Apple planning to release the software to the public this fall. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shazam/">Shazam</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/watchos-11-shazam-widget/">watchOS 11 Gains Integrated Shazam Widget for Identifying Songs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-gains-integrated-shazam-widget-for-identifying-songs.2429057/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 18 Adds More Control Over Adaptive Audio on AirPods Pro 2</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> have an Adaptive Audio feature that includes Adaptive Noise Control, Personalized Volume, and Conversation Awareness, which are all features that adjust sound and Active Noise Cancellation in response to the environment around you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/airpods-adaptive-audio.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955239" /><br/>
Right now, Adaptive Audio is an all or nothing setting, but that's set to change in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple added a "Customize Adaptive Audio" menu that lets you adjust the setting to allow for more or less noise.<br/>
<br/>
When the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware/">latest beta firmware</a> are connected to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, you can open up the AirPods section of the Settings app to see a new Adaptive Audio section.<br/>
<br/>
Tapping into it presents a slider bar where you can adjust Adaptive Audio for Less Noise or More Noise, impacting the Adaptive Audio settings. The feature will mostly apply to Adaptive Noise Control, a feature that blends Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation. It is designed to tweak the level of noise control based on changing conditions in the environment, so being able to set it to allow for more noise or less noise will come in handy.<br/>
<br/>
The setting will also impact Personalized Volume, an option that adjusts the volume of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 based on your personal volume preferences and environmental conditions.<br/>
<br/>
These settings will be widely available to &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 owners when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; launches in the fall. The earbuds will also be able to be adjusted using iPadOS 18 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-adaptive-audio-options/">iOS 18 Adds More Control Over Adaptive Audio on AirPods Pro 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-adds-more-control-over-adaptive-audio-on-airpods-pro-2.2429056/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> has had a Power Reserve function that holds back a small amount of battery life to allow features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> and NFC unlocking to work even when your device has died, and in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple seems to be improving the feature further for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
As demonstrated on Reddit, when the battery on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is exhausted, the phone can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1ddpgb4/ios_18_db1_you_can_now_see_the_time_even_after/">continue to show the time</a> in the upper left corner of the device, which is a small but useful upgrade. The battery icon still shows up, and you'll see "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is Findable" while reserve battery is left. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-iphone-time-off.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955275" /><br/>
It appears that this feature is limited to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models. We tested on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro Max and were not ale to get the time to show up, but it did work as expected with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max. <br/>
<br/>
Power Reserve has been a feature on iPhones dating back to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XR and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS, so it's not clear what the limiting factor is in terms of showing the time on display when the battery has drained on older devices. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-time-no-battery-life/">Your iPhone 15 Can Show the Time When It&#039;s Out of Battery in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/your-iphone-15-can-show-the-time-when-its-out-of-battery-in-ios-18.2429053/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just months after naming AllTrails the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-unveils-app-store-award-winners-the-best-apps-and-games-of-2023/">iPhone App of the Year in 2023</a>, Apple has added new hiking features of its own to the Maps app on iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Hiking-Trails-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955271" /><br/>
Apple Maps users in the U.S. can browse thousands of hikes across all 63 national parks in the country, filtered by length, elevation, and route type. Users can also create and save their own custom walking and hiking routes, with one-way, out-and-back, and loop routing options to choose from where available. <br/>
<br/>
Apple Maps added topographic maps on the Apple Watch with watchOS 10 last year, and these maps are now available on the iPhone too with iOS 18. Topographic maps and hikes can be saved for offline access with turn-by-turn voice guidance.<br/>
<br/>
These features are mostly limited to the U.S., but topographic maps are also available in Japan, according to fine print <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18-preview/">on Apple's website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes all of the features:<blockquote>Apple Maps introduces even more ways to explore the world, including hikes and custom walking routes. Users can browse thousands of hikes across national parks in the United States — filtered by length, elevation, and route type — and save them to use while offline. Users can also create their own custom walking routes with just a few taps to plan everything from a local exercise route to a full-day walking tour in a new city. Additionally, they can save their favorite national park hikes, custom walking routes, and places to an all-new Places Library, and add personal notes about them.</blockquote><em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a> exclusively revealed that these features were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/">coming to Apple Maps on the iPhone</a> earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is currently in beta and should be released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/apple-maps-hiking-features-on-ios-18/">Apple Maps Rivals AllTrails on iOS 18 With New Hiking Features in U.S.</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-rivals-alltrails-on-ios-18-with-new-hiking-features-in-u-s.2429049/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> includes a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/lockedcameracapture">LockedCameraCapture framework</a> for developers, which will bring some useful new functionality to third-party apps with camera features. The update will let a third-party camera app be opened directly from the Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iphone-locked-camera-capture.jpg" alt="" width="852" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955234" /><br/>
The expansion of Control Center in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; allows for third-party apps to be added to Control Center for quick access, and Control Center integrates with both the Lock Screen and the Action button. With this integration, third-party camera apps such as Halide will be able to create a Control Center camera button, which can then be added to the Control Center and stored in the new Control Center gallery.<br/>
<br/>
The Lock Screen's standard Camera and Flashlight quick access buttons can be replaced with other Control Center integrations, including third-party ones, plus the Action button can be set to a Control Center control. So the ultimate result of all of this interconnection is the option to have a quick access camera button for a third-party camera app on the Lock Screen, rather than being limited to Apple's built-in Camera.<br/>
<br/>
Further, with the specific LockedCameraCapture framework, the third-party camera app will be able to be opened into camera mode while an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is locked, mimicking the functionality that's available with the standard Camera app.<br/>
<blockquote>Use the LockedCameraCapture framework to create an extension that allows people to launch your app's camera experience and capture content quickly when the device is locked. This extension makes your camera experience accessible to people from Control Center, the Lock Screen, or the Action button.</blockquote><br/>
The framework allows for a button that opens directly into the camera of an app, even if the camera is not the app's only feature. Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and similar social networks could use this option to create a Control Center camera button able to be added to the Lock Screen that will allow for the quick capturing of photos and videos that could then be uploaded after unlocking a device.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this would not upload content directly, as there is wording in the framework that requires the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to be unlocked to view or complete a task with the video or photo captured from a locked &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
This option will also be useful for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who prefer to capture images with a third-party camera app like Halide, as it will make the Halide camera feel much more like a default camera app able to be opened up by means other than activating it from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Developers will need to add this framework to their apps, so it is a capability that we'll start seeing in action following the public launch of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-activate-camera-app-lock-screen/">iOS 18 Will Let You Activate Third-Party Camera From iPhone&#039;s Lock Screen or Action Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-will-let-you-activate-third-party-camera-from-iphones-lock-screen-or-action-button.2429039/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models have an Action button in place of the Ring/Silent switch on older iPhones, and iOS 18 makes it even more useful.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Control-Center-Toggles-for-Action-Button-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955224" /><em>Screenshot Credit: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a></em></div><br/>
iOS 18 allows the Action button to be assigned to one of the dozens of controls available in the new Control Center gallery, allowing the Action button to invoke Dark Mode, Airplane Mode, Personal Hotspot, and more. Options like Low Power Mode and Orientation Lock do not appear to be available as of iOS 18 beta 1, but the Shortcut action already allows the Action button to be assigned to those options if desired.<br/>
<br/>
These new options are in addition to the actions that were already available for the Action button on iOS 17, including Ring/Silent, Do Not Disturb, Camera, Flashlight, Voice Memo, Magnifier, Translate, Shortcut, and Accessibility. Some of the new Control Center options were already possible with the Shortcut or Accessibility options.<br/>
<br/>
It has been rumored that the Action button will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">expanded to all four iPhone 16 models</a> later this year, so these new controls will come to even more devices.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is currently in beta and should be released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/action-button/">Action Button</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-control-center-options-action-button/">iOS 18 Adds Control Center Options to Action Button on iPhone 15 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-adds-control-center-options-to-action-button-on-iphone-15-pro.2429032/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the WWDC keynote on Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook discussed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence</a> and more with popular tech content creators Justine Ezarik (iJustine), Marques Brownlee (MKBHD), and Safwan AhmedMia (SuperSaf). The videos are now on YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Tim-Cook-WWDC-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955202" /><br/>
Cook touched on how Apple Intelligence features are designed to improve the lives of customers, with strong privacy safeguards in place.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence will allow users to summarize text and notifications, create custom emoji and images, and more. Siri is also getting smarter with Apple Intelligence, with richer language understanding and more per-app controls. These features will require an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, or a Mac or iPad with an M1 chip or newer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence will be available when iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia are released later this year, but the features will have a beta label at launch. Developers will be able to start testing the features on the iOS 18 beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-ios-18-beta/">later this summer</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On iPhone 15 models, iOS 18 will recommend that users set a particular charging limit for their device based on their recent usage habits, with the aim of potentially improving their iPhone battery's lifespan by reducing the time that the battery is fully charged.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iphone-battery-charge-limit-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955180" /><br/>
All four iPhone 15 models feature a setting that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-battery-charging-limit/">prevents the devices from charging beyond 80%</a> while toggled on, and iOS 18 expands the feature by adding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-introduces-more-charging-limits/">new 85%, 90%, and 95% charging limit options</a>. With the new limit options, iOS 18 now takes a proactive approach to improving battery longevity by recommending a specific charging limit to users via a notification.<br/>
<br/>
The recommendation also appears in the Settings app under Battery → Charging. The charging limit feature remains exclusive to the iPhone 15 lineup on the first iOS 18 beta, with the option not found on the iPhone 14 Pro or older.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-recommended-charge-limit.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955190" /><br/>
In a related change, anecdotal reports suggest that iOS 18 could be recalibrating some devices' maximum battery capacity percentage. In Settings ➝ Battery ➝ Battery Health, "Maximum Capacity" is a measure of battery capacity relative to when the device was new. Lower capacity can result in fewer hours of usage between charges.<br/>

The first iOS 18 beta is available for Apple Developer Program members, and a public beta will follow in July. After beta testing is complete, the update should be widely released to all users with an iPhone XS or newer in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-charging-limit-recommendations/">iOS 18 Actively Recommends Charging Limit Based on iPhone 15 Usage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-actively-recommends-charging-limit-based-on-iphone-15-usage.2429011/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
