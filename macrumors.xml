		<description><![CDATA[Apple is delaying plans for a major new campus located in North Carolina, reports the <em><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2024/05/20/apple-rtp-jobs-north-carolina-construction-campus.html">Triangle Business Journal</a></em>. Back in 2021, Apple said it would invest more than &#36;1 billion in North Carolina, a project that included a new engineering and research center in the Research Triangle area of Raleigh and Durham.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-722008" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/12/apple_rtp_land.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><em>Assemblage of seven properties in Research Triangle Park owned by Apple</em></div><br/>
A limited amount of progress on the campus has been made since the announcement, and Apple has not provided updates on construction until now. Apple told <em>Triangle Business Journal</em> that it has paused work on the campus, and it is working with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and the North Carolina Department of Commerce to extend the project's timeline by four years.<br/>
<br/>
No reason was given for the delay, but Apple said that it is still committed to building in North Carolina.<br/>
<blockquote>Apple has been operating in North Carolina for over two decades. And we're deeply committed to growing our teams here. In the last three years, we've added more than 600 people to our team in Raleigh, and we're looking forward to developing our new campus in the coming years.</blockquote><br/>
Apple last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/apple-north-carolina-campus-first-phase/">filed development plans</a> for the first phase of construction, but the specific timeline for the project has never been clear. Apple's plans for Research Triangle Park include six buildings and a parking garage totaling 700,000 square feet of office space, 190,000 square feet of accessory space, and close to 3,000 parking spaces spanning 41 acres.<br/>
<br/>
Apple owns 281 acres of land in the area where it plans to build its campus, so there could ultimately be several phases of construction. As it prepares to build the NC research center, Apple is leasing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/29/apple-metlife-campus-nc/">more than 200,000 square feet</a> of office space in Cary, North Carolina.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-north-carolina-campus-paused/">Apple Pauses Work on Planned North Carolina Campus</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pauses-work-on-planned-north-carolina-campus.2430005/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple turned down an AI partnership with Facebook parent company Meta due to privacy concerns, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/apple-spurned-idea-of-iphone-ai-partnership-with-meta-months-ago">Bloomberg</a></em>. Meta and Apple had a brief discussion about a possible partnership in March, but the talks did not progress and Apple does not plan to integrate Meta's large language model (LLM) into iOS.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956714" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/meta-ai.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="608" /><br/>
<br/>
Over the weekend, <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> suggested that Apple and Meta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-meta-talks-ai-model-ios-18/">were in active discussions</a> about integrating Llama, Facebook's LLM, into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> as part of Apple Intelligence. The report suggested that the discussions were ongoing had not been finalized, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s follow-up indicates Apple never seriously considered a partnership.<br/>
<br/>
Preliminary talks happened at the same time that Apple began discussions with OpenAI and Google parent company Alphabet, but Apple decided not to move on to a more formal discussion because "it doesn't see that company's privacy practices as stringent enough."<br/>
<br/>
Apple did end up signing a deal with OpenAI, and ChatGPT will be integrated into &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>. Users can opt-in to ChatGPT, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> able to hand some requests off to the more sophisticated AI model. Apple is also working on a deal with Google to integrate Gemini into its operating systems, and it is holding discussions with AI company Anthropic.<br/>
<br/>
At WWDC, Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi said that Apple wants to provide users with a choice between different AI models, with the company planning to establish deals with multiple providers.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-meta-ai-privacy-concerns/">Apple Wasn&#039;t Interested in AI Partnership With Meta Due to Privacy Concerns</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wasnt-interested-in-ai-partnership-with-meta-due-to-privacy-concerns.2430002/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 197 includes fixes and updates for Canvas, CSS, Forms, JavaScript, Media, Rendering, Security, SVG, Web Inspector, WebDriver, and WebGL.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> beta, the newest version of macOS that Apple is beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-197/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 197 With macOS Sequoia Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-197-with-macos-sequoia-support.2430001/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sets-bold-new-goals-for-automating-iphone-factories"><em>The Information</em> today reported</a> that shortly after COVID-19-related lockdowns and protests in China <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/06/apple-warns-of-lower-iphone-14-pro-shipments/">impacted iPhone assembler Foxconn</a> in late 2022, Apple's senior vice president of operations Sabih Khan instructed managers to reduce the number of workers on iPhone assembly lines by as much as 50% over the following few years.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPhone-Assembly.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956778" /><br/>
To achieve this goal, Apple allegedly began approving high-cost automation projects for iPhone assembly that it previously shied away from. The report claims these efforts resulted in a "significant amount" of automation being involved for iPhone 15 production, but automation has still posed challenges for Apple due to manufacturing complexities.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the report claims that Apple had to cancel some automation processes for the iPhone 16 series due to a "high rate of defects":<blockquote>This year, Apple sought to build on some of its automation successes by using machines to install the iPhone's buttons, receiver, speaker and main logic board into its chassis, according to three people who worked in Apple's supply chain. But the machines stumbled in properly fastening those components, which have to be carefully screwed into position at odd angles, the people said.</blockquote>Apple's push for automation could allow it to move even more iPhone assembly to countries outside of China, such as India, Vietnam, and Thailand, as part of the company's efforts to diversify its supply chain in Southeast Asia.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second betas of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> to developers, and the software adds support for new features that Apple is working on, plus it tweaks some of the interface changes that have been made in the updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" /><br/>
Apple will refine &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; over the course of the next few months, with multiple changes and refinements expected from now until September. We've highlighted everything new in the second &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Mirroring</h2><br/>
When paired with a Mac running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> beta 2, &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 2 supports the Mac-based <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring feature. With &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring, you can control your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; using your Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-iphone-mirroring.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956750" /><br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring can be enabled by clicking on the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring icon on a Mac and following the instructions. It lets you open and use apps, manage notifications, and more, all while your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Toggle</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 2 adds a toggle for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a> messaging protocol that will replace SMS and MMS, but &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; is not yet functional. Right now, the &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; toggle only shows up for U.S. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who have a carrier that supports &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, which includes T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;T.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-beta-2-rcs-toggle.jpg" alt="" width="2174" height="1223" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956804" /><br/>
&zwnj;RCS&zwnj; will improve text messaging conversations with Android users, allowing for higher-quality images and videos, read receipts, typing indicators, Tapback support, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Home Screen</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> icon on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> now has a dark mode, which changes the background color of the app. There's also a wallpaper tinting toggle that can be used in automatic mode, something that wasn't an option before. The toggle makes the wallpaper you've chosen darker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/app-store-dark-mode-icon.jpg" alt="" width="1460" height="821" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956805" /><br/>
For some icons, the second beta improves the contrast of the tint feature by adding more dark areas.<br/>
<br/>
Note that tinting and icon color changes seem to be quite buggy in beta 2, and sometimes tints won't deactivate until the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is restarted.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Widgets</h2><br/>
There's a new Connected Card Wallet widget app, but it does not appear to be functional as of yet. Connected Cards integrate with the Wallet app to display total card balance and transaction history. In the United States, this feature only works with Discover at the current time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-wallet-app-connected-cards.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956806" /><br/>
<h2>Passwords App</h2><br/>
There's a "+" button in the main view of the Passwords app when you open it, so you can add a new item without having to tap the "All" icon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-passwords-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956809" /><br/>
<h2>Control Center</h2><br/>
The power button in the Control Center has a more pronounced haptic feel when pressing it, and it only triggers with a press rather than just a tap. The change will prevent the power button from accidentally being activated when using Control Center.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>EU App Ecosystem Changes</h2><br/>
In the European Union, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/ipados-18-beta-2-includes-eu-changes/">iPadOS 18 beta adds support</a> for alternative app marketplaces and downloading apps from websites. These are the same changes that Apple made to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in iOS 17.4, with the updates now extended to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> as required by the European Commission.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the second developer beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple has added support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, one of the main updates coming to the Mac. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring is a Continuity feature that lets you control your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from your Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-iphone-mirroring.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956750" /><br/>
When you're signed in to the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> on a Mac and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, you can use &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring to interact with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; even when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is locked. You can open up and use apps, deal with notifications, send messages, and more.<br/>
<br/>
You can use your Mac keyboard, trackpad, or mouse with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, which is useful for typing up long emails and other documents on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it provides an easy way to keep up with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; notifications without having to pull out your device and check it. When you click on a notification on your Mac when using &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring, it is supposed to open up right into the app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Though it isn't enabled in this beta, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring will eventually allow files, photos, and videos to be dragged and dropped between your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Mac and vice versa. Apple plans to add that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring feature later in 2024, and it won't be available when &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; first launches.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iphone-screen-mirroring.jpg" alt="" width="2501" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956795" /><br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring requires an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> beta 2 and a Mac running &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta 2, and it is accessible using the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring icon in the Dock. It works on Macs that have an Apple silicon chip or a T2 Security Chip, and you'll need to have the devices near each other with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and you'll need to be signed in to the same &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; with two-factor authentication turned on. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring can't be used when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sidecar/">Sidecar</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> are activated.<br/>
<br/>
Today's second beta also adds &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> support for remote control when using the SharePlay screen sharing feature.

The &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; and &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; betas are only available to developers right now, but Apple plans to release a public beta in July that will allow anyone to try out the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring feature before it launches.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vbmd38t5">announced</a> that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-2-to-developers/">second beta of iPadOS 18</a> extends alternative app marketplaces and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu">other app-related changes</a> to the iPad in the EU.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933094" /><br/>
Apple first introduced these changes on the iPhone in the EU with iOS 17.4 earlier this year, to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act. The expansion of the changes to the iPad in the EU comes nearly two months after the European Commission said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/eu-says-ipados-digital-gatekeeper-dma/">iPadOS is also a gatekeeper platform</a> under these new regulations.<br/>
<br/>
The other changes include alternative payment options in the App Store, a default web browser selection screen in Safari, the ability for web browsers to use web engines other than Apple's WebKit on the iPhone and iPad, and more. Apple's existing terms extend to the iPad, including the Core Technology Fee for alternative app marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 18 is currently in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July. The update should be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/ipados-18-beta-2-includes-eu-changes/">iPadOS 18 Beta 2 Includes Alternative App Stores and Other EU Changes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-18-beta-2-includes-alternative-app-stores-and-other-eu-changes.2429975/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second betas of upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-first-developer-betas-new-software/">release of the first betas</a> after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> keynote event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;‌ Developer Beta setting. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, a set of AI features that are built deeply into the operating system. Apple Intelligence won't be coming until later in the beta testing process, but it includes features for refining and editing writing, generating images and emoji, and most notably, improving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and search. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is gaining a better understanding of natural language, improved contextual awareness, and the personal assistant will integrate with ChatGPT to answer more complex queries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads with an M-series chip, but there are a number of other features that are coming. Apple is allowing users to rearrange Home screen apps to have open spaces, plus there's a dark mode for app icons and tinting options.<br/>
<br/>
The Control Center is customizable and third-party developers can add controls for their apps, with the Lock Screen Flashlight and Camera icons able to be replaced or removed. Messages is gaining Rich Communication Services support to improve conversations with Android users, the option to schedule texts to be sent later, new text effects, messages over satellite when there's no cellular, and the option to use any emoji for Tapback responses.<br/>
<br/>
There's a dedicated Passwords app for logins, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes, and there's now an option to lock and hide apps, which means they can't be opened without secondary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication even when your phone is unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
Safari has a highlights feature that summarizes articles and surfaces key information on websites, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app interface has been overhauled, and there's a new Tap to Cash feature for privately and securely transferring money using Apple Cash. Other features include equation solving and voice memo transcription in Notes, a game mode for improving game performance, and an option to respond to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on AirPods with head gestures.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is only available to registered developers at the current time, but Apple plans to make a public beta available in July. &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; will see a public launch this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-betas-of-ios-18-and-ipados-18-to-developers.2429966/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of upcoming an upcoming macOS 15 Sequoia update to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-first-developer-betas-new-software/">release of the first beta</a> after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> keynote event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macOS-Sequoia-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955370" /><br/>
Registered developers can opt-in to the beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> introduces <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, which allows you to control your locked &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from your Mac. You can open and use &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps, interact with notifications, and drag and drop files between your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Mac and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
There are new options for window tiling, and dragging a window to the edge of the display will suggest a tiled location to make it easier to use multiple apps at once. Apple is adding a Passwords app for managing passwords, Safari can summarize websites and surface key information, and Notes has support for live audio transcription and math equations.<br/>
<br/>
All of the Apple Intelligence features coming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will also be available in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, but Apple does not plan to add these until later in the beta testing process. Apple Intelligence includes Writing Tools for editing, proofreading, and summarizing text in apps, and an Image Playground allows for AI images to be created from prompts.<br/>
<br/>
Custom emoji or "Genmoji" can be created for any situation and used just like emoji, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is getting much smarter. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do more in apps and will better understand requests, especially those made in regard to on-screen content.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; is available to developers right now, but Apple will release a public beta in July.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-2/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of macOS Sequoia to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-macos-sequoia-to-developers.2429965/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> update to developers, with the second beta coming two weeks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-first-developer-betas-new-software/">after the first beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; is able to take the depth information from 2D photos and turn them into 3D photos using advanced machine learning. Apple says that the feature is meant to add depth to photos to make memories more immersive.<br/>
<br/>
There are new hand gestures for activating the Home View and Control Center, and the Home View is also now customizable with apps able to be rearranged. Travel Mode now includes support for trains, and Guest User profiles are now saved for 30 days so guests don't have to do the setup process every time they try out the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the year, Mac Virtual Display will support higher resolution and larger sized virtual displays, which Apple says will be equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. With an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> update, the Vision Pro can serve as an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; receiver, so content from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac can be shared to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Mindfulness app can track and respond to breathing patterns using the camera for an improved meditation experience, and the Vision Pro supports Bluetooth mice with &zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second visionOS 2 Beta to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-visionos-2-beta-to-developers.2429973/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the ‌&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; introduces a new Vitals app that aggregates health metrics collected during sleep like heart rate and respiratory rate, providing day-to-day health insights to track whether something has changed. There's also a Training Load feature for monitoring the intensity of workouts and how that impacts the body over time.<br/>
<br/>
The Smart Stack has been updated with new widgets and support for Live Activities and Translate, plus it is better able to suggest widgets based on time and daily routine. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> watch face includes suggestions for the best images to use, and the Check In safety feature now works with Workouts.<br/>
<br/>
Activity Rings can be customized to change the goals for each day, and there is an option to pause for rest days or when ill without losing an activity streak.

tvOS 18 adds an InSight feature to the TV app, and it is able to provide real-time information about actors, music, and more in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> shows and music. Enhanced Dialogue has been refined with machine learning and computational audio so it is better able to boost vocal clarity over background noise and music, plus it is now available on built-in TV speakers, AirPods, and other Bluetooth devices.<br/>

<br/>
Other new features include 21:9 aspect ratio support for projectors, new screen savers and improved controls for swapping screen savers, and support for Live Captions during <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls through an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of tvOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-tvos-18-to-developers.2429972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has held discussions with Meta about integrating the Facebook owner's AI model into iOS 18 as part of its Apple Intelligence feature set, according to a report over the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/meta-ai.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="608" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956714" /><br/>
Meta launched Llama 2, its large language model, in July 2023, and in April, the company released the latest versions of its AI models, called <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/">Llama 3</a>. <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/apple-meta-have-discussed-an-ai-partnership-cc57437e">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> reports that the two longtime rivals have held talks about offering Meta's model as an additional option to OpenAI's ChatGPT. The paywalled report notes that the discussions haven't been finalized and could fall through.<br/>
<br/>
As part of Apple Intelligence, Apple has announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow Siri to access ChatGPT directly in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia to provide better responses in relevant situations. Using ChatGPT will be optional, so users with concerns about the technology can abstain and still make use of Apple's own new AI features.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking at WWDC 2024, Apple's senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi said that the company eventually wants to give its users a choice between different AI models. Federighi also suggested that Google Gemini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/apple-add-more-ai-models-in-future/">could be an option</a> in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Apple isn't paying OpenAI as part of the partnership, and <em>WSJ</em> reports that discussions with other AI companies have similarly taken place with the understanding that neither party will pay each other. Rather, pushing an AI model to hundreds of millions of Apple devices is considered to be of equal or greater value: AI companies get to sell premium subscriptions to their services through Apple Intelligence, while Apple is in a position to take a commission on sales. <br/>
<br/>
However, it's still not clear how much of a financial windfall such deals will be for AI companies in the long term, given that a surge of users from Apple devices will undoubtedly require more of the companies' own compute power and budget.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-meta-talks-ai-model-ios-18/">Apple and Meta Reportedly Discussed AI Partnership for iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-meta-reportedly-discussed-ai-partnership-for-ios-18.2429940/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple could offer a cheaper version of its Apple Vision Pro headset by making the device reliant on a tethered iPhone or Mac, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Box-and-Ref-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932237" /><br/>
Last week, a report claimed that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2/">suspended work on the second-generation Apple Vision Pro</a> in order to focus on bringing a cheaper model to market. However, Gurman claims Apple shifted resources to developing a cheaper model even before the Vision Pro was released, and he has now offered some more details on how Apple plans to build a more affordable spatial computing unit.<br/>
<br/>
Writing in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-23/apple-vision-plans-cheaper-model-in-late-2025-vision-pro-2-in-2026-ar-glasses-lxrjk6wu">latest Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman says that a prototype lower-cost headset, codenamed N107, has a narrower field of view compared to Vision Pro. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is also considering making this version more reliant on a tethered Mac or iPhone. "That would let Apple save money on the processing power and components needed to make the Vision Pro a fully standalone product," he argues.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says that Apple is still struggling to bring the cost down while retaining key features. But if it can, Apple plans to launch the cheaper headset as early as the end of 2025. Indeed, this has been the plan "since before the Vision Pro was unveiled last year," he adds.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman doubled down on his reaction to last week's report by noting that Apple has no plans to abandon the high end of the headset market, and while it's "less of a priority," Apple is still working on a second-generation Vision Pro, codenamed N109.<br/>
<br/>
This model is said to look similar to the current Vision Pro, but has a faster processor and improvements to the external cameras. The company reportedly plans to release the Apple Vision Pro 2 by the end of 2026 at the earliest.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/cheaper-apple-vision-pro-tethered-iphone-mac/">Cheaper Apple Vision Headset Might Require a Tethered iPhone or Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cheaper-apple-vision-headset-might-require-a-tethered-iphone-or-mac.2429938/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple wants iPhone and iPad users to be able to format external drives connected to their device, without the need for a Mac, based on the latest find in the iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 developer betas (via <em><a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/ipados-18-adds-support-for-formatting-external-drives/">MacStories</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPadOS-18-on-iPad-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955618" /><br/>
Writing in his <a href="https://kalebcadle.substack.com/p/ipados-18-adds-another-very-useful">ByteBits</a> substack, Kaleb Cadle said he made the discovery of new file format options while tinkering with the Files app:<br/>
<blockquote>Now in the Files app on iPadOS 18, when we right click or hold press on an external drive and select "Erase", new options appear for reformatting the drive. Currently, the format options here are APFS (with options for Case Sensitive or Encrypted), ExFAT, and MS-DOS (FAT), the same format options available in Disc Utility (with the exception of macOS extension formats which wouldn't make much sense for this feature on iPadOS). This is a major improvement for iPad power users and it will be interesting to keep an eye out for new improvements to this functionality and others within the Files app over the course of the iPadOS 18 beta cycle. It seems Apple may be taking a similar tact to the way they incorporated much of the functionality of the Preview app into the Files app via Quick Look, but now with functionality from Disc Utility.</blockquote><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/files-app-format-drives.jpeg" alt="" width="1456" height="970" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956702" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>File format options in the Files app on iPadOS 18 (Image: Kaleb Cadle).</em></div><br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 18 and iOS 18 are currently in beta. Apple plans to release the second betas to developers on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/ios-18-beta-2-coming-monday/">Monday</a>.<br/>

		<title>EU Accuses Apple&#039;s App Store Steering Rules of Violating DMA and Opens Investigation into Developer Fees</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The European Commission has formally announced its preliminary view that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies are in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), specifically in relation to anti-steering rules.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers, and allow them to make purchases. The Commission says that Apple's "business terms" with developers prevent that. <br/>
<br/>
"Developers cannot provide pricing information within the app or communicate in any other way with their customers to promote offers available on alternative distribution channels," said the Commission in its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_3433">press release</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Commission also said that Apple's link-out process for steering customers is "subject to several restrictions imposed by Apple that prevent app developers from communicating, promoting offers and concluding contracts through the distribution channel of their choice."<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the Commission believes that the fees charged by Apple for facilitating new customer acquisition via the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; "go beyond what is strictly necessary for such remuneration." For example, Apple charges developers a fee for every purchase of digital goods or services a user makes within seven days after a link-out from the app, and the Commission sees this as excessive.<br/>
<br/>
The Commission also said it was opening a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns that its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces, including its €0.50 Core Technology Fee, "fall short of ensuring effective compliance with Apple's obligations under the DMA."<br/>
<br/>
Responding to the Commission's announcement, Apple provided <em>MacRumors</em> with the following statement:<br/>
<blockquote>"Throughout the past several months, Apple has made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission. We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created. All developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilize the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate. As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission."</blockquote>Now that the Commission has informed Apple of its preliminary view, Apple can exercise its defence by examining the documents in the Commission's investigation file and replying in writing to the Commission's preliminary findings. If Apple was found to be in breach of the DMA, the company could face fines up to 10% of its worldwide revenue. The Commission's final decision is due by March 2025.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The avalanche of news coming out of WWDC earlier this month is finally starting to slow, but that doesn't mean there wasn't still lots to talk about in Apple news and rumors this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/top-stories-22jun2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956530" /><br/>
This week saw some additional rumors about the upcoming Apple Watch models, the release of major Final Cut Pro updates, the launch of Apple's annual Back to School promo in the U.S. and Canada, new budget-friendly Beats earbuds, and more, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Series 10 Rumored to Feature Larger Screen and Thinner Design</h2><br/>
2024 could be a big year for the Apple Watch, with rumors suggesting that Apple plans to unveil a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">special tenth-anniversary model with a major redesign</a>, just like it did with the iPhone X.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-X-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906752" /><br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo this week said the tentatively-named "Apple Watch Series 10" (which could end up being named the Apple Watch X or something else) will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">feature larger 45mm and 49mm screen size options, along with a thinner design</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo also believes the Apple Watch Ultra 3 could be available in a black or dark finish if production is successful. The devices should be unveiled in September alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 series</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Final Cut Pro Gets Major Update, New Camera App for iPhone</h2><br/>
Major new versions of Apple's professional video creation app Final Cut Pro were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/final-cut-pro-major-update/">released this week for compatible Mac and iPad models</a>.

Notably, Apple has released an all-new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/final-cut-pro-major-update/">Final Cut Camera companion app for the iPhone</a>. The app powers the new Live Multicam feature in Final Cut Pro for iPad, and it also works as a standalone video recording app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's Back to School Sale Launches in U.S. and Canada</h2><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-back-to-schoo-promotion-launches/">annual Back to School promotion has returned in the U.S. and Canada</a>, offering students and select educational staff a free Apple gift card with the purchase of an eligible new Mac or iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/back-to-school-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956521" /><br/>

As usual, the Back to School promotion is on top of Apple's regular educational discounts for students.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>These iOS 18 Features Aren't Coming to iPhones Until iOS 18.1 or Later</h2><br/>
iOS 18 includes many new features for the iPhone, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/ios-18-features-coming-in-ios-18-1-or-later/">not all of them will be available when the update is initially released</a> to the public in September.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
In an article this week, we listed all of the new features and changes that will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/ios-18-features-coming-in-ios-18-1-or-later/">not be available until a later version of iOS 18</a>, according to Apple's website. These features should begin rolling out with iOS 18.1 in October, followed by iOS 18.2 in December, with more to come next year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Beats Solo Buds Now Available: 18-Hour Battery and a Tiny Case for &#36;79.99</h2><br/>
The new Beats Solo Buds wireless earbuds are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/beats-solo-buds-orders/">now available to order on Apple's online store</a> for delivery, and they can also be purchased in person <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/beats-solo-buds-available-at-apple-stores-today/">at select Apple retail stores</a> and resellers around the world.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Beats-Solo-Buds-Hands-on-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956024" /><br/>
Beats Solo Buds feature an affordable &#36;79.99 price, up to 18 hours of battery life, and a compact USB-C carrying case. However, they lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-06-21/more-choice-for-us-subscribers/">today announced</a> the launch of a new Basic paid plan that offers a small discount for dropping access to audiobooks. Priced at &#36;10.99 per month, the Basic option includes all of the music benefits of Spotify like ad-free playback, but without added monthly audiobook listening time.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810756" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" /><br/>
The &#36;11.99 standard Premium Individual plan that Spotify offers includes ad-free playback and 15 hours of audiobook listening time per month from a catalog of more than 250,000 titles. Until now, Spotify did not let customers opt for a cheaper plan that did not include audiobook access, as it was automatically bundled in the lowest-tier plan.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify in June <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/spotify-price-increase/">raised its base price</a> from &#36;10.99 to &#36;11.99 to "bring users the best experience," but with the new Basic plan, customers who don't want to use the audiobook feature can get the prior &#36;10.99/month price.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify's new &#36;10.99 per month option is on par with the &#36;10.99 price of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, so Spotify is no longer &#36;1 more expensive than &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; for base music subscription service.<br/>
<br/>
There have been no changes to the prices of other plans. Duo is priced at &#36;16.99, and Family is priced at &#36;19.99. Spotify also has a &#36;9.99 per month plan that offers 15 hours of audiobook listening with ad-supported music.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/spotify-cheaper-premium-plan/">Spotify Launches Cheaper &#36;10.99/Month Premium Plan Without Audiobooks</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-launches-cheaper-10-99-month-premium-plan-without-audiobooks.2429791/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
