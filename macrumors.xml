		<description><![CDATA[Apple will begin encouraging artists and record labels to adopt Spatial Audio with royalty incentives, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-11/apple-dangles-reward-for-musicians-to-use-high-end-audio-format"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>

Citing sources familiar with the matter, <em>Bloomberg</em> says that Apple will prioritize streams of songs mixed in Dolby Atmos technology in its streaming calculations starting next year. The change will result in higher royalty payments for artists and labels that adopt and expand the technology in their catalogs. Listeners do not have to listen to the Spatial Audio version of a song for artists to be eligible for the added benefits, with the availability of tracks in Dolby Atmos being sufficient. The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> policy is yet to be publicly announced.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/apple-music-spatial-audio-announced/">introduced</a> Spatial Audio support in 2021, using Dolby Atmos technology to ostensibly replicate an in-person music experience with sound coming from various directions around the listener when using compatible audio hardware. In February 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/16/apple-music-spatial-audio-lossless-interview/">announced</a> that over half of the service's subscribers used the feature. Amazon Music similarly provides Dolby Atmos audio at no additional cost, but Spotify has yet to adopt the format. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-to-incentivize-spatial-audio/">Apple Music to Incentivize Artists to Make Songs Available in Spatial Audio</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-to-incentivize-artists-to-make-songs-available-in-spatial-audio.2413377/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung has a new <a href="https://howl.me/ck6A9ZkhXNT">Winter sale</a> that began today, offering discounts across monitors, TVs, smartphones, tablets, computers, and home appliances. Many of the deals in this sale are the same prices we tracked during Samsung's Black Friday sale, and some are even beating their all-time low Black Friday prices. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/samsung-best-holiday.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923404" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The highlight of the sale is Samsung's ViewFinity S9 5K Smart Monitor at <a href="https://howl.me/ck3bAoFu1ed"><strong>&#36;999.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.99. This is a new record low price on the monitor, and it beats the previous all-time low price seen at Amazon last week by a few dollars.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ck6A9ZkhXNT"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">SITEWIDE SALE</div>Samsung's Winter Sale</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the Smart Monitor M8 is at its all-time low price on Amazon, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0C3WMX69W%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26smid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a> (&#36;300 off). This has been one of the all-around best monitor deals we've tracked during this holiday season, and it's hard to say if it'll return after this sale ends, so if you want it for Christmas be sure to place an order soon.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung is encouraging users to shop through the Shop Samsung mobile app this season, which has some exclusive deals and deep discounts on smartphones, smartwatches, and mobile accessories. Clicking any of the Samsung links in this post while on mobile should give you the option to install the app.<br/>
<br/>
Other than monitors and TVs, we're also now tracking quite a few deals on refrigerators, tablets, and computers below. These sale prices will be live for this week only, so be sure to check out Samsung's event before the best prices of the year disappear.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With no new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models launched this year, Apple ostensibly has some significant changes in store for its tablet lineup and accessories in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/03/ipad-fall-2022-lineup-details.jpg" alt="" width="2038" height="960" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-870294" /><em>Apple's entire &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup as of December 2023.</em></div><br/>
The entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models are all reportedly due a hardware update in 2024. Here's how the lineup of 2024 could compare to today based on rumors:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple is also reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/">working on a new Apple Pencil</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">redesigned Magic Keyboard</a> accessory for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">with an aluminum top case</a> and a larger trackpad. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; accessory lineup could look as follows by the end of next year:<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
In his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-10/apple-aapl-to-fix-confusing-ipad-lineup-with-new-ipad-pro-mid-tier-ipad-air-lpzjekw4">"Power On" newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple is seeking to reduce confusion between the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; next year by introducing OLED displays, an updated design, the M3 chip, and a revamped Magic Keyboard accessory on the high-end models. This "will make it unmistakably the highest-end model," Gurman says. <br/>
<br/>
He also highlighted that the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will feature slightly different display sizes, just like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and MacBook Pro, where the high-end models have larger screens. The ninth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will reportedly be discontinued upon the release of the 11th-generation version, allowing the company to ultimately phase out the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to use the Magic Keyboard as a differentiator for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; in 2024. The redesigned version of the accessory will not be compatible with the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, being exclusive to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The 10.9- and 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models will only be able to use the current Magic Keyboard accessories. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman said that the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are due to launch around March 2024, with the updated entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; set to arrive later in the year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/what-the-2024-ipad-lineup-could-look-like/">Here&#039;s What the iPad Lineup Could Look Like in 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-what-the-ipad-lineup-could-look-like-in-2024.2413375/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heading into 2024, there are several preannounced or rumored iOS 17 and iOS 18 features that are expected to launch throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17-and-18-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925944" /><br/>
Below, we have listed six iOS features that should be released for the iPhone in 2024, including collaborative Apple Music playlists, app sideloading in the European Union, next-generation CarPlay, roadside assistance via satellite outside of the U.S., RCS support in the Messages app, and generative AI functionality for Siri.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Collaborative Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-music-collaborative-playlist.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898803" /><br/>
A new Collaborative Playlists option for Apple Music will allow multiple people to add, reorder, and remove songs in a shared playlist.<br/>
<br/>
This feature was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/">initially expected to launch with iOS 17.2</a> this month, but it was removed from that update towards the end of beta testing, without any explanation from Apple. It will likely return in a later iOS 17 update in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Sideloading in EU</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last year reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/13/apple-europe-alternate-app-store-support/">preparing to allow app sideloading on the iPhone</a> in order to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act. This would allow users to install apps outside of Apple's App Store, but the change is only expected to be made in European Union countries, at least initially.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman recently said that he expects app sideloading in the EU to roll out in an iOS 17 update released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/eu-iphone-app-sideloading-coming-2024/">in the first half of 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/next-generation-carplay-multi-display.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848463" /><br/>
At WWDC in June 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">previewed the next generation of CarPlay</a>, promising deeper integration with vehicle functions like A/C and FM radio, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, increased personalization, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's website <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">still says</a> the first vehicles with support for the next-generation CarPlay experience will be announced in "late 2023," but with only a few weeks remaining in the year, it's unclear if that timeframe will still be met. Regardless, the next-generation CarPlay experience would likely not be available to customers until 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Roadside Assistance via Satellite Outside U.S.</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-roadside-assistance.jpg" alt="" width="1596" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910510" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 17, all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models offer a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-roadside-assistance-feature-tested/">roadside assistance via satellite feature</a> that allows users in the U.S. to contact roadside assistance company AAA for vehicle service when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said the feature is available "beginning" in the U.S., so it will likely expand to some additional countries starting in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November, Apple announced that it will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later next year," so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li><br/>
 <li>Improved encryption compared to SMS</li><br/>
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smarter Siri</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">iOS 18 to feature generative AI technology</a> that "should improve how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences." He said Apple has also explored generative AI features for other apps across its platforms, including Apple Music, Pages, Keynote, and Xcode.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em> reported that Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">incorporate large language models into Siri</a> to let users automate complex tasks, a feature that would involve deeper integration with the Shortcuts app. The report said this feature is expected to be released in an iPhone software update coming next year, which would likely be iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity last year when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts. Google and Microsoft released similar chatbots earlier this year, as more companies race into the space. The chatbots are trained on large language models, allowing them to respond like a human.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/new-ios-17-and-ios-18-features-expected-in-2024/">These Six New iOS 17 and iOS 18 Features Are Expected Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-six-new-ios-17-and-ios-18-features-are-expected-next-year.2413373/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home">Sonos</a> is back with a sale that's matching the all-time low prices we saw over Black Friday for many of its audio products. In total, you can <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/promotional-offers">get up to 25 percent off</a> select devices, and Sonos is still guaranteeing delivery in time for Christmas if ordered by 11 a.m. on December 19.<br/>

All the prices in this sale are matching the ones we tracked during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, meaning they're the best prices we've ever seen for these devices. Additionally, the new holiday sale is expanded with bundle options for anyone looking to purchase a full home theater speaker system this season.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Vision Pro customers will likely be pushed to pick up the device at an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-10/apple-aapl-to-fix-confusing-ipad-lineup-with-new-ipad-pro-mid-tier-ipad-air-lpzjekw4">Mark Gurman reports</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-components.jpg" alt="" width="2034" height="1144" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898850" /><br/>
In October, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-to-host-secretive-vision-pro-training-event/">Gurman reported</a> that Apple was in the process of inviting retail store employees from each &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; in the United States to Cupertino, California to receive training on using and selling the Vision Pro headset. Apple apparently sent a memo to retail employees asking them to apply for the "secretive" event, with acceptance dependent on an application and interview process. An extract from the memo read:<blockquote>Selected team members will travel and participate in an event in Cupertino, California, at some point in the first months of 2024. Upon returning to their home store, they'll deliver training and ongoing support to store team members. This is a group opportunity for those who have a deep passion for demonstrating Apple products and teaching others.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
In the latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-10/apple-aapl-to-fix-confusing-ipad-lineup-with-new-ipad-pro-mid-tier-ipad-air-lpzjekw4">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman said that these seminars are now being scheduled with staff training set to start in mid-January. Each &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; employee in attendance will receive two days of training, featuring instructions on the Vision Pro's setup process, approaching a customer, and placing the device on a user's head. Gurman previously said that flagship retail stores are set to gain dedicated Vision Pro hands-on areas, while other stores will only receive one or two units.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman noted that "while customers will be able to reserve a Vision Pro online, it increasingly sounds like they'll be pushed to pick up the device at a store" with an appointment. Apple is planning to assemble customers' Vision Pro headsets in-store, compiling the appropriate headband, light seal, and optional prescription lenses. Retail stores are purportedly due to receive new equipment to assemble and package the headset in the near future. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman still believes that the device will likely be released before March. Apple simply says that the Vision Pro headset will launch in "early" 2024.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/">Retail</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-to-push-vision-pro-customers-to-pick-up/">Apple Preparing to Push Vision Pro Customers to Pick-Up at an Apple Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-push-vision-pro-customers-to-pick-up-at-an-apple-store.2413366/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple supplier Samsung Display has reorganized its Apple business team to achieve operational efficiency in the development of foldable panels, claims a new report out of Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="820" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-797663" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=24647">The Elec</a></em>, Samsung wants to strengthen its capabilities in anticipation of Apple's first foldable products by integrating the expertise it has gained making Samsung foldable devices since 2019. <br/>
<br/>
Samsung Display and LG Display are said to be already working on projects for Apple's foldable products, including panels with 20.25-inch dimensions, according to the report. It's not clear if the panel size relates to a specific product or a panel production process.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been known to be working on foldable display technology for some years now, filing multiple patents regarding the technology. Rumors in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/">September 2020</a> indicated that Samsung was providing foldable display samples to Apple for a future foldable ‌iPhone‌, but there had been no strong indication that Apple was planning to use Samsung's technology until now.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021, <em>Bloomberg</em> claimed that Apple had started "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor/">early work</a>" on an ‌iPhone‌ with a foldable display, but that it had not committed to releasing a foldable device at that time. Development in 2021 had not expanded beyond a display, and Apple did not have full foldable ‌iPhone‌ prototypes. <br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo initially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphones-with-under-screen-touch-id-now-coming-in-2023-foldable-iphone-in-2024/">said</a> that Apple would introduce a foldable ‌iPhone‌ in 2024, but in 2022, he revised his prediction and said that Apple is unlikely to unveil a foldable iPhone until <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/apple-testing-9-inch-foldable/">2025 or later</a>. Display analyst Ross Young has also suggested <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/21/apple-exploring-20-inch-foldable-macbook/">2025</a> is the earliest that we might see a foldable ‌iPhone‌.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-foldable-panels-samsung-display/">Samsung Display Readies Development Team for Apple Foldable Panels</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-display-readies-development-team-for-apple-foldable-panels.2413363/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple's supply chain started shipments of display panels for a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air this month, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1733886638210809912">post on X today</a> from Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants. Young has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/">good track record</a> for display-related Apple rumors, so the information he shared today is likely accurate.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">12.9” iPad Air panel shipments started in December…</p>&mdash; Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1733886638210809912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Multiple other sources have claimed that Apple is planning to release a 12.9-inch iPad Air, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/">Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em></a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/">Apple analyst Ming-Chu Kuo</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Earlier this week, Gurman said that he expects the 12.9-inch iPad Air to be released around March 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond its larger display size, no major design changes have been rumored yet for the 12.9-inch iPad Air. The current iPad Air is equipped with a 10.9-inch display, and that model is also expected to be updated around March next year. <br/>
<br/>
The next iPad Pro models are widely expected to be equipped with OLED displays, and they will likely be more expensive than the current iPad Pro models as a result. By sticking with a more cost-friendly LCD panel, the 12.9-inch iPad Air should be priced between the 10.9-inch iPad Air and the next 11-inch iPad Pro.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/">Ross Young</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">12.9-Inch iPad Air Display Shipments Reportedly Underway Ahead of March 2024 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments-reportedly-underway-ahead-of-march-2024-launch.2413333/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today confirmed that it took steps to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/beeper-mini-imessage-for-android-shutdown/">shut down the functionality</a> of Beeper Mini, an app that enabled Android users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android/">send and receive iMessages</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/beeper-mini.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925247" /><br/>
Apple emphasized its commitment to user privacy and security, explaining that the move was necessitated by the potential risks Beeper Mini's techniques posed, including metadata exposure and susceptibility to spam and phishing attacks. Apple's full statement shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23995150/beeper-imessage-android-apple-statement"><em>The Verge</em></a> and other news sites is as follows:<blockquote>At Apple, we build our products and services with industry-leading privacy and security technologies designed to give users control of their data and keep personal information safe. We took steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage. These techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks. We will continue to make updates in the future to protect our users. </blockquote>Beeper Mini operated by intercepting the iMessage protocol using Apple's own push notification service, convincing Apple's servers it was an authentic Apple device. This method, according to Apple, involved the use of "fake credentials," which posed significant security and privacy risks to users. Beeper claims that its process worked with no compromises to encryption or privacy, and the company's documentation says that nobody can read the content of sent messages other than the sender and its recipient, but Apple was unable to verify this and says it posed risks to users.<br/>
<br/>
Following Apple's statement, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky expressed his willingness to cooperate with Apple for a security review of Beeper's code to <em>The Verge</em>. He emphasized the importance of secure communication channels between <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Android users, challenging Apple's decision by highlighting the inadequacies of unencrypted SMS for cross-platform messaging. Despite Apple's firm stance, Migicovsky remains committed to exploring solutions that could enable the return of Beeper Mini or similar services.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/">iMessage</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/apple-confirms-it-shut-down-beeper-mini/">Apple Confirms It Shut Down iMessage for Android App Beeper Mini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-it-shut-down-imessage-for-android-app-beeper-mini.2413305/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple began accepting orders for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Pro Display XDR</a> on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/07/apple-releasing-mac-pro-december-10/">December 10, 2019</a>, making the high-end monitor four years old as of today. The monitor has not been updated since, but there have been rumors about a new model being in the works.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/Pro-Display-XDR-Yella.jpg" alt="" width="2590" height="1456" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-743451" /><br/>
Below, we recap all of the rumors about a potential next-generation Pro Display XDR so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Pro Display XDR</h2><br/>
In December 2022, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/">working on multiple new monitors</a>, including an updated Pro Display XDR equipped with an Apple silicon chip. Apple's lower-priced Studio Display has an A13 Bionic chip that enables features like Center Stage, spatial audio, and "Siri"/"Hey Siri" voice commands.<br/>
<br/>
In July 2023, Gurman reiterated that Apple was still working on multiple next-generation monitors for release in 2024 at the very earliest. He said at least one of these monitors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/gurman-apple-monitor-smart-home-display/">could double as a smart home display</a> in a low-power state.<br/>
<br/>
While no other features have been rumored yet for the next Pro Display XDR, some additions that customers are hoping for include a webcam, speakers, and a higher refresh rate. The current model features a 32-inch screen with LED backlighting, a 6K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports.<br/>
<br/>
The current Pro Display XDR starts at &#36;4,999 in the U.S., but the Pro Stand costs &#36;999 extra.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Larger iMac</h2><br/>
While it would be a different product, the rumored 32-inch iMac would have some similarities to the Pro Display XDR, including the same display size.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
In October 2023, both Gurman and Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">developing a 32-inch iMac for release in late 2024 or in 2025</a>. Kuo said the larger iMac's screen <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">would feature mini-LED backlighting</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The following month, Apple confirmed that it has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">no plans to release a 27-inch iMac with an Apple silicon chip</a>. Apple discontinued the Intel-based 27-inch iMac in March 2022. For customers who want a large-screened desktop setup, Apple has recommended pairing the 27-inch Studio Display with a Mac Studio or Mac mini. Apple did not explicitly rule out the possibility of a 32-inch iMac being released in the future.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, the 24-inch iMac was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/27/m3-imac-review/">recently updated with the M3 chip</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/next-pro-display-xdr-rumor-recap/">Pro Display XDR Turns Four Years Old: When to Expect a New Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pro-display-xdr-turns-four-years-old-when-to-expect-a-new-model.2413301/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's final set of major operating system updates for 2023 appears to be right around the corner, with iOS 17.2 and related updates likely coming next week to deliver a number of new features and improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/top-stories-9dec2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925719" /><br/>
This week also saw rumors about forthcoming updates for the iPad lineup and the MacBook Air, as well as the iPhone 16, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.2 Will Add These 12 New Features to Your iPhone</h2><br/>
Following over a month of beta testing, Apple is expected to release iOS 17.2 to the public next week. The software update includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/01/ios-17-2-list-of-12-new-features/">many new features and changes for the iPhone</a>, including a Journal app, spatial video recording on iPhone 15 Pro models, improvements to the Messages and Weather apps, a Favorite Songs playlist in Apple Music, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/New-iOS-17.2-Features.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925424" /><br/>
We've shared a list of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/01/ios-17-2-list-of-12-new-features/">12 new features and changes in iOS 17.2</a> for those interested in learning more, but there's plenty of additional tweaks and improvements coming in the update as well.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple to Launch Two iPad Air and Two OLED iPad Pro Models Early Next Year</h2><br/>
2023 is set to become the first calendar year with no new iPads released in the device's history. As a result of this hiatus, the entire iPad lineup is expected to be updated throughout 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/12.9-inch-ipad-pro-cyber.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875252" /><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/">release two new iPad Air models and update the iPad Pro line with OLED displays in March 2024</a>. The iPad mini and entry-level iPad are expected to be updated later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New M3 MacBook Air Models Expected Around March 2024</h2><br/>
In addition to new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/macbook-air-march-2024/">updated 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip</a> to launch around March 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/15inch-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916649" /><br/>
Apple already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">released 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chip options</a> last month. These are Apple's first chips to be manufactured with TSMC's 3nm process for faster performance.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Kuo: iPhone 16 Models to Feature Upgraded Microphone for Improved Siri AI Experience</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">iPhone 16 models will feature a significantly upgraded microphone</a> with a better signal-to-noise ratio and improved water resistance, according to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
Kuo said the upgraded microphone could indicate that Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">add more generative AI capabilities to Siri</a> as a key selling point of the iPhone 16 models, which are expected to launch in September 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>'All-Screen' iPhone Under-Display Camera Enters Development</h2><br/>
Apple supplier LG Innotek has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-under-display-camera/">started development of an under-display camera</a> that could pave the way for an all-screen iPhone in the future, according to a report this week from South Korea's <em>The Elec</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793995" /><br/>
An all-screen iPhone would also require the TrueDepth sensors for Face ID to be moved under the display, and rumors suggest that Apple might achieve this goal <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/under-display-face-id-2025-ross-young/">starting with the iPhone 17 Pro in 2025</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.2 Adds NameDrop-Like Feature for Sharing Boarding Passes, Movie Tickets, and More</h2><br/>
Starting with iOS 17.2, there is a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-share-contact-details-with-namedrop/">NameDrop</a>-like feature that allows an iPhone user to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/ios-17-namedrop-like-wallet-passes-sharing/">quickly share boarding passes, movie tickets, and other Wallet app passes</a> with another iPhone user.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/AirDrop-1Pass-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925564" /><br/>
iOS 17.2 is currently in beta, and it is expected to be released to the public next week. The update also adds a Journal app, spatial video recording on iPhone 15 Pro models, several improvements to the Messages and Weather apps, a Favorite Songs playlist in Apple Music, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/">getting a major overhaul in 2024</a>, with Apple introducing two new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models and two new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models. To go along with the new iPads, Apple plans to debut updated versions of both the Magic Keyboard and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/2021-Magic-Keyboard-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2226" height="1252" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-797122" /><br/>
<h2>Magic Keyboard</h2><br/>
Apple is overhauling the Magic Keyboard, introducing a sturdier frame that's made from aluminum rather than the more malleable polyurethane material that the current version is crafted from.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/magic-keyboard-yellow-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-844768" /><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, the aluminum design will allow an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Magic Keyboard combo to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">more closely resemble</a> one of Apple's MacBooks, which are also made from aluminum.<br/>
<br/>
The frame and the area around the keyboard will be made from aluminum, while the exterior shell will have the same silicone cover material. Apple also plans to implement a larger trackpad that more closely resembles the trackpad of the MacBook to better mirror the experience of typing on and navigating on a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple planning to adopt more premium materials for the Magic Keyboard, there is a chance that it could be more expensive than the current version, which is priced starting at &#36;299.<br/>
<br/>
Apple makes the Magic Keyboard in two sizes at the current time, and the accessory comes in either black or white. There hasn't been word on whether color options will change.<br/>
<br/>
In 2024, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is expected to come in both 10.9 and 12.9-inch sizes, while the next &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will be sized somewhere around 11.1 inches and 13 inches. The Magic Keyboards that Apple has in the works will likely fit both the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, as the current 11-inch Magic Keyboard works for the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and the 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pencil</h2><br/>
While Apple introduced a USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; in November that is technically the third &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; to date, it is considered a lower-end, more affordable &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; because it lacks key features like pressure sensitivity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/black-and-white-apple-pencil-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2664" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-744328" /><br/>
Apple is working on a "true" third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that will be a full successor to the second-generation model. There have been a few &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; rumors over the last three years, but it's not entirely clear what we can expect or if what we've heard is accurate at this point.<br/>
<br/>
In June 2020, leaker Mr. White said that the next-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/02/future-apple-pencil-black-color/">would be available in black</a> and white, but this rumor has not been repeated since. All &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models to date have been white.<br/>
<br/>
Leaker Majin Bu said in October that the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">feature interchangeable magnetic tips</a> for different activities like drawing, painting, and technical sketches, but that rumor was in reference to the now-released USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and it may have been inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in 2020 patented a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/">color sensing technology</a> that would let the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; sample colors from the environment, and that would be an interesting addition, but we don't know if that functionality will make it into an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Launch Date</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; are expected to get a refresh in early 2024, right around the March timeframe, so we could see the new Magic Keyboard and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to hold a spring event to introduce the new iPads and possibly the accessories.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/">Magic Keyboard</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/magic-keyboard-apple-pencil-rumors/">What&#039;s Next for the iPad Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whats-next-for-the-ipad-magic-keyboard-and-apple-pencil.2413222/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A check signed by former Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/348161106800099-steve-jobs-signed-apple-computer-company-check-to-radioshack-july-23-1976/">sold for &#36;46,063</a> at auction this week. Issued by "Apple Computer Company" in 1976, the &#36;4.01 check was made out to electronics retailer RadioShack.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/steve-jobs-check.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1062" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925189" /><br/>
Jobs filled out the check on July 23, 1976, which was the time that he and Steve Wozniak were working on the Apple-1 computer. The two produced approximately 200 Apple-1 machines, 50 of which were sold to The Byte Shop in July 1976 and retailed for &#36;666.66.<br/>
<br/>
The RadioShack check lists a Palo Alto address for an answering service and mail drop off point that Jobs used while Apple was being run out of his parents' garage.<br/>
<br/>
RR Auction expected the check to sell for at least &#36;25,000, but it sold for more. Apple and Steve Jobs memorabilia has been fetching higher and higher prices in recent years.<br/>
<br/>
Another check signed by Steve Jobs was put <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2023/history-of-science-technology-including-natural-history/jobs-steven-apple-computer-co">up for auction this week by Sothebys</a>, and it too could sell for upwards of &#36;40,000. The check predates Apple's April 1, 1976 founding date as it was written on March 28, 1976. It is one of a handful of checks issued to Jobs and Wozniak ahead of when they received their custom-printed Apple Computer Company checkbook.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/steve-jobs-apple-check-auction/">Apple Computer Check Signed by Steve Jobs Sells for &#36;46,000</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-computer-check-signed-by-steve-jobs-sells-for-46-000.2413219/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to have closed the loophole that Beeper Mini used to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android/">bring iMessage to Android</a>, putting a stop to blue bubbles from Android devices. Beeper Mini quit working earlier today, with users receiving "failed to lookup on server: lookup request timed out" error messages.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/beeper-mini.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925247" /><br/>
Beeper said on Twitter that it is <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733223640270082501">investigating the issue</a>, but Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky told <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/apple-cuts-off-beeper-minis-access-after-launch-of-service-that-brought-imessage-to-android/">TechCrunch</a></em> that "all data" suggests that Apple has in fact found a way to stop Beeper Mini from working.<br/>
<br/>
Introduced on Tuesday, Beeper Mini used <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/how-beeper-mini-works">reverse engineered iMessage protocols</a> and encryption, taking advantage of Apple's own iMessage servers to allow Android users to send blue bubble iMessages to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users. The app supported all iMessage functionality, including read receipts, typing indicators, reactions, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iMessage for Android is Here Right Now Beeper Mini" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B19HBmw0gKU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Beeper Mini did not require an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>, a departure from other, less secure iMessage on Android apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/22/sunbird-shuts-down-android-imessage-app/">like Sunbird</a>. The way Beeper Mini functioned was <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/how-beeper-mini-works">explained in-depth</a> in a blog post, giving Apple insight into how it worked. Beeper Mini was using reverse engineering from security researcher jjtech, who also <a href="https://jjtech.dev/reverse-engineering/imessage-explained/">outlined his methodology</a> and shared a proof-of-concept iMessage implementation on Github.<br/>
<br/>
The app communicated directly with Apple's iMessage servers, and registered the phone numbers of Beeper users as iMessage users to allow for blue bubble access. After Beeper Mini's launch, there was immediate speculation that Apple would shut it down, but it was not clear if Apple would be able to do so given the way that it mimicked actual iMessage users. <br/>
<br/>
Apple appears to have found a way, so this could be the end of Beeper Mini. Migicovsky told <em>TechCrunch</em> that the company will "evaluate options" to figure out what it means for the future of the app.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/beeper-mini-imessage-for-android-shutdown/">Apple Puts a Stop to Beeper Mini&#039;s iMessage for Android Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-puts-a-stop-to-beeper-minis-imessage-for-android-feature.2413215/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple vice president of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Apple Watch product design Tang Tan is departing the company in a move that will lead to changes in the hardware engineering group, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-08/apple-s-iphone-and-watch-product-design-chief-to-leave-in-shake-up">Bloomberg</a></em>. Tan, who reports to Apple's senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus, is set to leave Apple in February.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Green.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912516" /><br/>
Tan's exit from the company will see several employees that work under Ternus and Tan receiving expanded roles. Head of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; product design Richard Dinh will take over &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; development for Tan and will report directly to Ternus, while Mac hardware engineering vice president Kate Bergeron will handle Apple Watch design.<br/>
<br/>
Tan also oversaw accessory design and the acoustics team that develops the AirPods, with those two groups being handed over to Matthew Costello, the former chief operating officer of Beats. Costello is in already in charge of Beats and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple employees that spoke to <em>Bloomberg</em> have called Tan's departure "a blow" because he is responsible for making critical decisions about the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Apple Watch, and AirPods. His team has control over product features and design.<br/>
<br/>
News of Tan's departure comes just a few days after <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that Steve Hotelling, an Apple hardware VP, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/executive-behind-hardware-technologies-retires/">is set to retire</a>. Hotelling leads the camera engineering team and has worked on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, haptic feedback, ProMotion, and other key Apple technologies.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/iphone-product-design-vp-leaves-apple/">Apple&#039;s Hardware Engineering Group Faces Restructuring as iPhone Product Design VP Departs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-hardware-engineering-group-faces-restructuring-as-iphone-product-design-vp-departs.2413201/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.2 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes, but tvOS 17.2 introduces an overhauled &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app.<br/>
<br/>
The app now includes a sidebar that houses content from both Apple's services and streaming services that integrate with the tvOS Watch Now feature. There are dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>‌, MLS Season Pass, Sports, the Store, and the Library at the top of the sidebar, along with dedicated sections for streaming services like ABC, CBS, Comedy Central, Hulu, ESPN, Discovery, Peacock, Prime Video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
You can click into each streaming service to see content that's available specifically on that service, and there's also a new My TV section that replaces "My Channels."<br/>
<br/>
In the prior RC, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/apple-itunes-movies-tv-show-apps-tvos-17-2/">began the process</a> of sunsetting the iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Show apps. Attempting to use these apps redirects customers to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app for movie and TV show purchases. In the future, Apple plans to remove these apps, leaving the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app as the hub for viewing and purchasing content.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also released a new release candidate for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 17.2 software. Both tvOS 17.2 and &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 17.2 are expected to be released next week alongside iOS 17.2. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-release-candidate-2/">Apple Seeds Second tvOS 17.2 Release Candidate to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-tvos-17-2-release-candidate-to-developers.2413187/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon has a few big discounts on Apple Watch today, headlined by a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX3VVKS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1">new all-time low price on the Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. Many of these watches can be delivered by Christmas, with delivery dates around the middle of next week for most models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-black-friday.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921788" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Ultra 2</h2><br/>
Starting with the Apple Watch Ultra 2, Amazon has the new 2023 wearable for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX3VVKS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;699.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;799.00. This is the first time we've ever tracked a &#36;100 discount on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and it's only available in the Green/Grey Trail Loop right now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-ultra-1-black-friday.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921791" /><div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX3VVKS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;699.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Note that you will need to clip an on-page coupon worth &#36;50 in order to see the final &#36;699.00 price tag at the checkout screen. There are a few Apple Watch Ultra 2 models at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWYVS23%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;729.99</strong></a> on Amazon, which is a solid second-best price.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Series 9</h2><br/>
Amazon also has a few Apple Watch Series 9 devices on sale. You can get the 41mm GPS device for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7PGCS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;309.99</strong></a> in Midnight Aluminum, down from &#36;399.00. That's an all-time low price that's even beating the sales we tracked over Black Friday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-series-9-black-friday.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921790" /><div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7PGCS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;89 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm GPS) for &#36;309.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Only the 41mm GPS Midnight Aluminum color is available at this record low price, but you can still shop quite a few second-best prices if you prefer other colors. You'll find these at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX1RVMT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;329.99</strong></a>, although some may arrive after Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
For 45mm GPS options, you can get two colors for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX13ZGM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;339.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;429.00. These are all-time low prices that are again beating Black Friday deals, and both Midnight and Silver Aluminum are available to deliver before Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX13ZGM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;89 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm GPS) for &#36;339.99</div></a></div> <h2>Apple Watch SE</h2><br/>
Finally, low prices have also returned to the Apple Watch SE. You can get the 40mm GPS model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8RVB8%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.00</strong></a> in multiple colors, down from &#36;249.00. The 44mm GPS model is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX3GRK2%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;229.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;279.00.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8RVB8%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch SE (40mm GPS) for &#36;199.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the recent Apple One <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">price hike</a>, on this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/is-apple-one-worth-it/id1602394741?i=1000637948103">The MacRumors Show</a> we take a closer look at Apple's subscription bundle and each of the services within it. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nF4cRmXpgy4?si=zelSwIhAAMTz8dnm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> is a bundle of Apple subscription services available at a lower overall price. The "Individual" plan includes iCloud+ (50GB), Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Arcade. The "Family" plan adds 150GB of iCloud storage and the ability to share with up to five people, while the "Premier" plan adds 1.8TB of iCloud storage, Apple Fitness+, and Apple News+. The recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">price rises</a> for the bundles are as follows:<ul><li><strong>Individual:</strong> &#36;16.95 per month → &#36;19.95 per month</li><br/>
<li><strong>Family:</strong> &#36;22.95 per month → &#36;25.95 per month</li><br/>
<li><strong>Premier:</strong> &#36;32.95 per month → &#36;37.95 per month</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
We discuss our feelings about each of the individual services included in the bundle, looking at our personal experiences, what we like about each of them, and where they could improve. We ultimately weigh up whether Apple One is worth it and ponder what new Apple services could be on the horizon, such as Apple Books+, Apple Podcasts+, and Apple Health+.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy's <a href="https://howl.me/clapGA6niXh">month-long holiday sale</a> continues this weekend with multiple all-time low prices on Apple's line of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air computers. In addition to Apple notebooks, Best Buy's event has discounts sitewide on home appliances, TVs, video games, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/best-buy-snowflakes.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923671" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
<br/>
Apple's 512GB 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro is available for <a href="https://howl.me/ck8G8OHT1KE"><strong>&#36;1,399.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.00. The prices in this article reflect final deal prices applied for My Best Buy Plus or My Best Buy Total members. If you're not a member, you can <a href="https://howl.me/claoLvzSkBc">sign up on Best Buy's website</a> starting at &#36;49.99/year for My Best Buy Plus.<br/>
