		<description><![CDATA[We're tracking a huge collection of discounts on Apple products and related accessories this weekend as we head into the final days before Father's Day this Sunday, June 16. With two days to go until Father's Day, most orders placed today will probably miss the delivery window, but there are steep discounts here that are worth looking into even if they arrive a bit after the holiday. <br/>
<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
These sales include discounts on AirPods, iPads, MacBooks, Sonos speakers, and other products. All of the deals listed in this article have already begun, and most of them will last until Sunday, June 16, unless otherwise stated.<br/>

AirPods deals are in abundance this week, perfectly timed for anyone who wants to pick up a pair for Father's Day. The rarest discount is &#36;100 off the AirPods Max, but you'll also find steep markdowns on AirPods 2, AirPods 3, and AirPods Pro 2, all on Amazon.<br/>

Just like the M3 MacBook Air, deals on the previous generation model are focused on the 13-inch sizes. Amazon has &#36;170 off every model in every colorway, starting at &#36;829.00 for 256GB and rising to &#36;1,029.00 for 512GB.<br/>

Sonos began its <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/promotional-offers">Father's Day sale</a> last week, and it's still going on this weekend. In this sale, you can find steep discounts on select home theater audio equipment. This includes record low prices on the Sonos Arc soundbar (&#36;719), as well as various discounted bundles, all of which are rare deals we haven't tracked since earlier in the year.<br/>
<br/>
This sale has a good balance between individual Sonos products and bundles that should help elevate your home theater setup with various soundbars, subwoofers, and speakers.

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 includes a handful of enhancements to the Wallet app on the iPhone, with new features for Apple Pay, Apple Cash, event tickets, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Wallet-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955476" /><br/>
Below, we outline everything new for the Wallet app on iOS 18, based on information from <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/new-features-come-to-apple-services-this-fall/">Apple's press release</a> and a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10108/">WWDC 2024 coding session</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Redesigned Event Tickets</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/redesigned-event-tickets-in-Wallet-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955528" /><br/>
Event tickets have an all-new design in the Wallet app on iOS 18, complete with relevant info like a map of the stadium and other venues, local weather forecasts, recommended Apple Music playlists for concerts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Event Tickets as Live Activities</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Live-Activities-Event-Tickets.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955525" /><br/>
Event tickets now work with the Live Activities feature, so you can view your seating information on the Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island when you are near the venue. Live Activities also appear on the Apple Watch on watchOS 11.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Tap to Cash</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tap-to-cash-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954862" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/tap-to-cash-ios-18-pay-touch-iphones/">Tap to Cash</a> is a new iOS 18 feature that allows users in the U.S. to send and receive Apple Cash by simply holding two iPhones together.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Tap to Add New Cards to Wallet App</h2><br/>
A new Tap to Provision feature on iOS 18 will allow users to add eligible credit or debit cards to the Wallet app by simply tapping their card on the back of their iPhone. Apple says this feature will only be available in select countries.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pay in Any Desktop Browser</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Pay-Code-Scan-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955376" /><br/>
iPhone users who update to iOS 18 will be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-apple-pay-in-any-desktop-browser/">use Apple Pay in desktop web browsers beyond Safari</a>, such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others. The computer running the browser can even be a Windows PC instead of a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Any website that implements the latest version of Apple Pay will support this new system. When a customer checks out with Apple Pay in a desktop browser other than Safari, a code will appear on the screen that can be scanned in the Camera app on an iPhone running iOS 18 or later, allowing them to complete the purchase on the iPhone.<br/>

Starting with iOS 18, Apple Pay will allow users to redeem rewards and access installment loan offerings from eligible credit and debit cards.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the details from Apple:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>The ability to redeem rewards will be available beginning in the U.S. with Discover and Synchrony, and across Apple Pay issuers with Fiserv.</li><br/>
<li>The ability to access installments from credit and debit cards will roll out starting in Australia with ANZ; in Spain with CaixaBank; in the U.K. with HSBC and Monzo; and in the U.S. with Citi, Synchrony, and issuers with Fiserv.</li><br/>
<li>Users in the U.S. will be able to apply for loans directly through Affirm when they check out with Apple Pay.</li></ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After over a year of reports, there are now more than a dozen specific rumors about the features and improvements set to be offered by the two non-Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models later in 2024. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-14-vs-16-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-941488" /></div><br/>
While the upgrades that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; offers over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> will likely be at the center of Apple's marketing strategy later this year, many users are on two-year upgrade cycles, so the features introduced on both the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will stack up. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their two direct forerunners are listed below, using information from a range of reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
This guide focuses on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but to learn about how we are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro to improve on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">see our other comparison article</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to largely carry over the design of their predecessors. As a result, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will be a relatively significant evolution over the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌, featuring slightly rounded edges, a frosted glass back, and a vertical rear camera arrangement to facilitate spatial video capture. Other important design changes are expected to include the removal of the mute switch in favor of the Action button introduced on last year's Pro models and the introduction of an all-new "Capture" button.<br/>

<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ in 2023, introducing a more modern design with the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, a USB-C port, and a 48-megapixel camera. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will build on these upgrades, offering the Capture and Action buttons, Apple Intelligence, and spatial video capture. With over 30 upgrades rumored to be in store, many ‌current &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ users will find upgrading to an ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; model worthwhile, if not essential.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to launch in the fall. Apple usually hosts an event every September to unveil new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, with launch following just over a week later.

		<description><![CDATA[New <a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/file/240612EN3.pdf">legislation in Japan</a> requires Apple to allow third-party app stores and payment providers on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/apple-japan-new-year-promotion-2022.jpg" alt="" width="1614" height="944" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-831082" /><br/>
The Japanese parliament has passed the Act on Promotion of Competition for Specified Smartphone Software, a law that compels Apple to allow access to third-party app stores and payment providers on devices that run iOS. The legislation, which was passed by Japan's upper house and will be enforced following Cabinet approval within the next eighteen months, seeks to curb the dominance of major tech firms like Apple in the smartphone market.<br/>
<br/>
The law requires Apple to make several significant changes to its business practices. The company will have to permit third-party app stores on its devices, just like it does in the EU. App developers will be allowed to use third-party payment services. There are also provisions to allow users to change default settings via new choice screens during setup, such as for selecting a default browser.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will be forbidden from giving its own services preferential treatment in search results without a justifiable reason. The law also prohibits the use of data acquired about competing software to benefit its own apps. Additionally, the law requires that third-party developers have access to the same features as Apple's own apps and services, such as NFC for contactless payments.<br/>
<br/>
Failure to comply with these new regulations could lead to fines amounting to 20 percent of relevant turnover, with the figure increasing to 30 percent for repeat offenses. In a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177599/apple-google-japan-law-third-party-app-stores-competition"><em>The Verge</em></a>, Apple said:<blockquote>The Japanese government made a number of changes to the legislation that will help protect user privacy, data security, innovation, and our intellectual property. We will continue our engagement with the JFTC during the implementation period as we remain concerned about how the law will impact Japanese consumers and the secure and private iPhone experience our users have come to expect.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The law is expected to be fully implemented by the end of 2025. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> has already announced plans to bring Fortnite and its game store platform to iOS in Japan by late 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Japan's move follows a trend of international legislative efforts aimed at regulating the dominance of major tech companies. The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the UK's Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill are similar initiatives designed to foster competition and prevent monopolistic practices. Various antitrust cases in the United States are also targeting similar issues.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/japan/">Japan</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/japan-passes-law-to-allow-third-party-app-stores/">Japan Passes Law to Allow Third-Party App Stores on the iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/japan-passes-law-to-allow-third-party-app-stores-on-the-iphone.2429185/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has been gradually expanding its suite of satellite connectivity features for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> brings a significant new one in the form of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/you-can-send-texts-via-satellite-in-ios-18/">Messages via satellite</a>. The feature allows users to send and receive iMessages and SMS texts, including emoji and Tapbacks, while out of range of cellular and Wi-Fi networks.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v30z-0bGbHQ?si=aezmpIgfkSqxhKAL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<em>CNET</em> met up with Apple's senior director of platform product marketing, Kurt Knight, this week for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v30z-0bGbHQ">early first look at how the feature works</a>, while iJustine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZMqOATNXE">offered a similar walkthrough</a> of it.<br/>
<br/>
When your phone detects it's out of range of terrestrial networks, you'll get a pop-up alert that offers quick access to all of the available satellite-enabled services including Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and now Messages.<br/>
<br/>
Messages via satellite can also be accessed directly from the Messages app when off the terrestrial grid, with iOS popping up a card to help you point your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; toward an available satellite. From there, it works just as a normal Messages conversation does, and you're able to send and receive messages, emoji, and Tapbacks. Conversation messages sent via iMessage are also end-to-end encrypted when sent via satellite.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BZMqOATNXE?si=ja5yD4WiskPg-Vgq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
iMessages can be sent freely back and forth via satellite, but there are limitations on SMS due to the volume of promotional and automated messages that come through that protocol. Your emergency contacts and specified family members will be able to contact you via SMS at any time, but for all other contacts, you will need to send the first SMS message via satellite, which will then allow them to respond for a period of time.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, despite Rich Communication Services (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>) support coming in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; later this year, Messages via satellite will not initially work with &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;. Knight says the &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; protocol has not yet been optimized to a small enough size to work over a satellite connection, at least as far as Apple is concerned. <br/>

As with Apple's other satellite services, Messages via satellite will launch initially only in the United States with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; before later expanding to other countries. Apple's satellite services work on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and later, and while Apple has indicated it will eventually charge for satellite services, it continues to offer them without charge for the time being.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/satellite/">Satellite</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-messages-via-satellite-first-look/">First Look at Messages via Satellite in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-look-at-messages-via-satellite-in-ios-18.2429147/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week previewed a new system that will allow iPhone users who update to iOS 18 to use Apple Pay in any desktop web browser, such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others. The computer running the browser can even be a Windows PC.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Pay-Code-Scan-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955376" /><br/>
Any website that implements the latest version of Apple Pay will support this new system. When a customer checks out with Apple Pay in a desktop browser other than Safari, a code will appear on the screen that can be scanned in the Camera app on an iPhone running iOS 18 or later, allowing them to complete the purchase on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Pay-Code-Scan-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955377" /><br/>
Apple provided more details about this system in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10108/">WWDC 2024 coding session</a> released today. It will take time for website developers to adopt the latest Apple Pay SDK, so this feature will not be widely available on the web right away.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Pay on the desktop web was previously limited to Safari on a Mac, so this is a much-awaited expansion of the feature to more browsers and devices.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is currently in beta, and it should be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-apple-pay-in-any-desktop-browser/">iOS 18 Enables You to Use Apple Pay With Chrome and More on Desktop</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-enables-you-to-use-apple-pay-with-chrome-and-more-on-desktop.2429140/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a few discounts across popular Apple accessories, including the AirTag and Apple Pencil. We're also tracking a few discounts on Eufy's own Bluetooth tracking accessories, the SmartTrack Link, which are slightly more affordable than the AirTag.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/airtag-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940079" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the AirTag, you can get the 4 Pack of trackers for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0932QJ2JZ"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;99.00. This is a solid second-best price on the accessory, and just about &#36;5 higher than the all-time low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0932QJ2JZ"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;19 OFF</div>AirTag 4 Pack for &#36;79.99</div></a></div><h2>Eufy</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/eufy-smartrack-link.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955367" /><br/>
<br/>
Anyone who needs a Bluetooth tracker but wants to save a bit of money should look at Anker's Eufy brand of trackers, which are on sale on Amazon right now and compatible with Find My on Apple devices. These start at just &#36;15.99 for one tracker and raise to &#36;48.99 for a 4 Pack. Eufy also has a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BKJZ5BVF%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.21TJMGTITJI3Q%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.21TJMGTITJI3Q_1718290256476">SmartTrack Card</a>, but right now there is no deal on that tracker.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B8GDXPBL%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.F587O4DYC8XW%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.F587O4DYC8XW_1718290050279"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;4 OFF</div>SmartTrack Link 1 Pack for &#36;15.99</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
If you're shopping for an Apple Pencil, Amazon has multiple models on sale this week. The biggest discount can be found on the Apple Pencil 2 at &#36;50 off, but you can also find sales on the newer Apple Pencil with USB-C from 2023 and the Apple Pencil Pro.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple did not mention CarPlay during its WWDC keynote this week, but iOS 18 includes a handful of new features for the in-car software.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955334" /><br/>
Overall, there is not a whole lot new for CarPlay on iOS 18, with changes seemingly limited to the Messages and Settings apps so far.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap everything new for CarPlay on iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New for CarPlay on iOS 18</h2><br/>
<h3>1. Contact Photos in Messages App</h3><br/>
iOS 18 adds contact photos next to names in the Messages app, making it easier to identify conversations at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955330" /><br/>
The contact photos are also visible in Messages app notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-4.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955327" /><br/>
<h3>2. Silent Mode Settings</h3><br/>
In the Settings app, you can now choose to have Silent mode on your iPhone automatically turn on or off when the device is connected to CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-5.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955326" /><br/>
<h3>3. Color Filters</h3><br/>
Apple has expanded Color Filters to CarPlay. This accessibility feature can help individuals with color blindness to differentiate colors on the CarPlay interface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-3.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955328" /><br/>
There is a grayscale option and three other color filters available to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955329" /><br/>
<h3>4. Voice Control</h3><br/>
Voice Control is another new accessibility feature that allows you to control CarPlay entirely with Siri voice commands through a connected iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-CarPlay-7.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955324" /><br/>
<h3>5. Sound Recognition</h3><br/>
Sound Recognition is expanding to CarPlay to provide notifications for driving-related sounds, such as car horns and sirens. This feature can be especially beneficial to drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CarPlay-Sound-Recognition.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="718" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950848" /><br/>
We did not see Sound Recognition in the CarPlay settings on iOS 18 beta 1.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Update — June 14: Sports Score Card via Siri</h3><br/>
We found another feature after publishing: if you ask Siri for a sports score, it will now show a card on the CarPlay interface. This works for the NBA and NHL at a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/CarPlay-iOS-18-Sports-Siri.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955473" /><br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
Apple shared some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-next-generation-carplay-images/">updated next-generation CarPlay images</a> during WWDC 2024, revealing new Vehicle, Media, and Climate apps on the screen for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Next-generation CarPlay will be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to uniquely match their vehicles. Apple revealed a variety of different design options and layouts that will be available to automakers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-2.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954801" /><br/>
Automakers will be able to show custom notifications on next-generation CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-WWDC-2024-Charging.jpg" alt="" width="1576" height="777" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954826" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple's website</a> continues to say that the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay will arrive in 2024, but it has yet to provide a more specific timeframe, and it did not provide any timing-related updates in its WWDC coding sessions.

<br/>

Monday's keynote event was insane, and jam-packed with an overwhelming number of AI features that are going to change the way we use Apple devices. We were able to visit the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> studio for the day just after the event to discuss what's in store. <br/>
<br/>
We take a look at Apple Intelligence, which is what Apple calls the AI capabilities coming to almost every app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>. Apple is focusing on practical tools that drastically improve the functionality of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, help you write and edit, and cut down on the little hassles in life. It's not all business, though, and there are some fun image and emoji generating tools that we go over, along with a surprising partnership with OpenAI that lets &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; loop in ChatGPT for requests. <br/>
<br/>
We also get into the new &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> design options, the revamped Control Center, and the features coming to Messages, plus we delve into the changes that Apple is making in iPadOS 18, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2, and watchOS 11. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[First introduced in April, spatial Personas in Apple Vision Pro are designed to feel as if they are in the same physical space, and to enhance the experience, the lifelike avatars will soon be able to interact directly with each other using some new gestures in visionOS 2.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Spatial-Persona-Apple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944483" /><br/>
Previewed at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/vision-pro-spatial-personas/">WWDC last year</a>, spatial Personas allow Vision Pro users to "break out of the familiar FaceTime tile and feel more present, like they are gathered in the same physical space," according to Apple. They feature a transparent background and are able to show body language and additional movement such as hand gestures for a more lifelike experience.<br/>
<br/>
As shared by indie developer <a href="https://x.com/xchester16/status/1800912216843321553">xChester on social media</a>, spatial Personas in the same Environment can now high five, fist bump and touch fingers, and the visionOS 2 beta provides visual and audio feedback to highlight the virtual interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in visionOS 2, spatial Personas can be invoked in the Photos app via SharePlay, allowing Vision Pro users to enjoy their panoramas, spatial videos, and more — all while feeling like everyone is in the same physical space.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Persona in visionOS now has both visual and sound feedback when people doing high five, fist bumping or finger touching. <br>Tried them out with <a href="https://twitter.com/Chill_VR_Jeff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Chill_VR_Jeff</a> and it&#39;s really fun.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWDC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/visionOS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#visionOS</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VisionPro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VisionPro</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Apple</a> <a href="https://t.co/KtIkwgHMHP">pic.twitter.com/KtIkwgHMHP</a></p>&mdash; xChester ᯅ (@xchester16) <a href="https://twitter.com/xchester16/status/1800912216843321553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
visionOS 2 is also giving developers more control over spatial Personas that will allow them to fine-tune the placement of Personas in their app, enabling new shared experiences in games, for example. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-releases-visionos-1-2/">visionOS‌ 1.2</a> earlier this week, and the update adds Persona improvements such as improved hair and makeup appearance, as well as better rendering for Eyesight.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/visionos-1-2-spatial-persona-interactive-gestures/">visionOS 2: Spatial Personas Can Touch Fingers, High Five, Fist Bump Each Other With Visual and Audio Feedback</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/visionos-2-spatial-personas-can-touch-fingers-high-five-fist-bump-each-other-with-visual-and-audio-feedback.2429109/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>watchOS 11: Smart Stack Gains Live Activities and Suggested Widgets</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Introduced in iOS 16, Live Activities changed the way users interact with their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Instead of getting multiple notifications when tracking a delivery or a sports score, for example, users see a single, dynamically updating Live Activity with real-time information right on their Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/live-activities-watchos-11.jpg" alt="" width="2510" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955298" /><br/>
Starting in watchOS 11, when a Live Activity begins on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, it now automatically shows on your Apple Watch at the top of the Smart Stack, allowing you to keep tabs on it just by raising your wrist. (Notably, Apple has also made it so that the design of clock at the top of the Smart Stack aligns with your current watch face.)<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch users will know that the Smart Stack is usually accessed from the watch face by turning the Digital Crown. But in watchOS 11, the Smart Stack can now open automatically when a Live Activity starts, and will remain visible when you lower your wrist. <br/>
<br/>
When you tap on the Live Activity, it opens the relevant app, and if there's no associated Apple Watch app, it turns into a convenient fullscreen view with a button to open the app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-13-at-11.34.15 AM.jpg" alt="" width="2505" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955299" /><br/>
If a Live Activity begins while you are in another Apple Watch app, it will appear in a special compact version at the bottom of the display. If you pull up on the compact view, it enlarges into the full widget, and if you tap on it, you'll be taken to the app or fullscreen view.<br/>
<br/>
In watchOS 11, Apple is also introducing "Suggested widgets," or widgets that the system intelligently adds or removes in the Smart Stack based on what's relevant in the moment. <br/>
<br/>
For example, if it's about to rain in 15 minutes, a new precipitation widget will appear in the Smart Stack ahead of time, and then disappear when the sky clears. Cues for suggested widgets can include location, date, sleep, fitness, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/shazam-widget-watchos-11.jpg" alt="" width="2509" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955300" /><br/>
Another example is the Shazam widget. It automatically appears in your Smart Stack when there's music playing around you so that you can use it to identify the song, and it will disappear when the music stops.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, Smart Stack widgets can now be interactive, and developers can bring toggles and switches into play, allowing users to perform quick actions without launching an app. An individual widget can be used to turn smart lights on and off, for example.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 11 is currently available to developers for testing purposes, with Apple planning to release the software to the public this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/watchos-11-live-activities-suggested-widgets/">watchOS 11: Smart Stack Gains Live Activities and Suggested Widgets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-smart-stack-gains-live-activities-and-suggested-widgets.2429105/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPadOS 18 Brings a New Customizable Tab Bar and Sidebar UI to Apps</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In iPadOS 18, Apple has redesigned the tab bar experience for many apps like Podcasts, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>. Previously in these apps, tabs sat at the bottom of the interface. When in portrait orientation however, tab bars now sit at the top of these apps to be closer to other navigation controls, while a customizable sidebar appears in landscape mode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tab-bar-ipados-18.jpg" alt="" width="2821" height="1408" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955290" /><br/>
In Apple apps other than the above, the tab bar appears in both portrait and landscape. Apple says having the tab bar at the top of the app and between other navigational controls reduces the amount of horizontal and vertical space used up by the interface, and allows users to focus more on the content. <br/>
<br/>
To accompany the new tab bars, sidebars in apps have been updated to help users navigate apps and provide quick access to top-level destinations. <br/>
<br/>
Together, side bars and tab bars support user customization, so it's now possible to drag and drop items from the sidebar into a pinned section on the tab bar for even quicker access to favorite content.<br/>
<br/>
Some items in the tab bar are, however, fixed. For example, in the TV app, the Home, TV+, MLS, and Store tabs are always available, and at the end of the pinned section, the search option remains a constant presence. It's worth noting that tab bars disappear when apps are in landscape orientation.<br/>
<br/>

Third-party developers have control over what appears in the new tab bar and sidebar, enabling them to determine what stays fixed, and what can be added or removed.<br/>
<br/>
The iPadOS 18 beta is available to developers at the current time, with Apple planning to introduce a public beta in July.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ipados-18-tab-bar-apps/">iPadOS 18 Brings a New Customizable Tab Bar and Sidebar UI to Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-18-brings-a-new-customizable-tab-bar-and-sidebar-ui-to-apps.2429100/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is adding Game Mode to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. A similar Game Mode was added to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> last year, and the same performance-enhancing features apply, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-game-mode.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955283" /><br/>
When enabled, Game Mode optimizes the gaming experience by giving the game the highest priority access to your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s processor, while lowering usage for background tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says Game Mode also improves the responsiveness of connected AirPods and game controllers by reducing input latency and audio latency.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing to set up with Game Mode – it turns on automatically when you launch a game or an app associated with a game, as indicated by a brief notification.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside its Apple Intelligence feature set, Apple on Monday announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow Siri to access ChatGPT directly in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia to provide better responses in relevant situations. But according to a new <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/apple-to-pay-openai-for-chatgpt-through-distribution-not-cash">Bloomberg</a></em> report, nobody is paying cash to anybody for the arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/open-ai-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1093" height="615" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953560" /><br/>
From Mark Gurman's report:<br/>
<blockquote>Apple isn't paying OpenAI as part of the partnership, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal terms are private. Instead, Apple believes pushing OpenAI's brand and technology to hundreds of millions of its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments, these people said.</blockquote>Despite the agreement, the partnership for OpenAI could become expensive, as more and more Apple device users tap into ChatGPT's capabilities and suck up more of the company's compute power and budget. <br/>
<br/>
However, Gurman notes that OpenAI could profit from the deal by encouraging Apple users to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus for &#36;20 a month. If these users sign up through an Apple device, Apple may also be in a position to receive a commission. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Apple plans to increase its earnings from AI through revenue-sharing agreements with its partners. According to the report, Apple is already discussing offering Google's Gemini chatbot as an additional option, an agreement that should be in place later this year. <br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, Apple aims to take a portion of the revenue generated from monetizing chatbot results on its operating systems, anticipating that more users will rely on AI instead of search engines. Such a shift could eventually reduce the massive amounts of revenue Apple currently earns from its lucrative search deal with Google.<br/>

The report notes that Apple has yet to reach a deal with a local Chinese provider to handle chatbot feature, but has been considering an arrangement with companies such as Baidu and Alibaba. To begin with, Apple Intelligence will only be available in U.S. English, with more languages set to be supported next year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/apple-not-paying-openai-chatgpt-ios-18/">Apple Reportedly Not Paying OpenAI to Use ChatGPT in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-not-paying-openai-to-use-chatgpt-in-ios-18.2429090/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tile, known for its Bluetooth tracking devices, was recently hacked, according to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/hacker-accesses-internal-tile-tool-that-provides-location-data-to-cops/">report from <em>404 Media</em></a>. A hacker was able to gain access to Tile's internal tools that are used for processing location data requests for law enforcement officers, and that gave the hacker customer names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/tile-sticker-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-797864" /><br/>
Data breaches are not uncommon these days, but Tile was not forthcoming about the attack and did not mention it until being contacted by <em>404 Media</em>. The site learned about the breach from the hacker. Tile parent company Life360 published a statement about the attack on its website after being prompted to do so by <em>404 Media</em>.<br/>
<blockquote>Similar to many other companies, Life360 recently became the victim of a criminal extortion attempt. We received emails from an unknown actor claiming to possess Tile customer information. We promptly initiated an investigation into the potential incident and detected unauthorized access to a Tile customer support platform (but not our Tile service platform). The potentially impacted data consists of information such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and Tile device identification numbers. It does not include more sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, passwords or log-in credentials, location data, or government-issued identification numbers, because the Tile customer support platform did not contain these information types.<br/>
<br/>
We believe this incident was limited to the specific Tile customer support data described above and is not more widespread. We take this event and the security of customer information seriously. We have taken and will continue to take steps designed to further protect our systems from bad actors, and we have reported this event and the extortion attempt to law enforcement. We remain committed to keeping families safe online and in the real world.</blockquote><br/>
While no location information was obtained, the incident is alarming because of the nature of the tool that the hacker was able to access. The hacker was able to get into Tile's system using credentials from a former Tile employee, and was able to get into a tool that could be used to look up Tile customers by phone number. Part of that tool allowed for searching location history.<br/>
<br/>
Tile told <em>404 Media</em> that the hacker would not have been able to access location data from the platform that was attacked, but did not confirm whether the hacker had the appropriate authentication to perform a location request once the internal tool was accessed.<br/>
<br/>
Tile is one of Apple's main competitors in the item tracking space, with Tile's trackers available as an alternative to Apple's AirTags.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/tile-hacked-customer-data-obtained/">Hackers Access Tile&#039;s Internal Tracking Tools, Customer Data</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hackers-access-tiles-internal-tracking-tools-customer-data.2429059/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The watchOS 11 update that Apple plans to release this fall offers several new widgets, including a built-in Shazam widget. Shazam has been able to be downloaded on the Apple Watch from the Apple Watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> or accessed via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, but it hasn't been available through the Smart Stack feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/shazam-for-mac.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857861" /><br/>
Apple plans to add a Shazam widget to Smart Stack with the watchOS 11 update, making it quicker to get to without &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; or downloading an app. You can access the Apple Watch Smart Stack by turning the Digital Crown.<br/>
<br/>
The Smart Stack is improving with the update, and widgets will be displayed based on time, location, and other factors, plus Live Activities are supported for keeping up with sports games or an approaching ride right from the wrist.<br/>
<br/>
Along with Shazam, other new Smart Stack widget additions include severe weather alerts, Translate, Training Load (a new watchOS 11 Workout feature), <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, and Distance. watchOS 11 is currently available to developers for testing purposes, with Apple planning to release the software to the public this fall. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shazam/">Shazam</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/watchos-11-shazam-widget/">watchOS 11 Gains Integrated Shazam Widget for Identifying Songs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-gains-integrated-shazam-widget-for-identifying-songs.2429057/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 18 Adds More Control Over Adaptive Audio on AirPods Pro 2</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> have an Adaptive Audio feature that includes Adaptive Noise Control, Personalized Volume, and Conversation Awareness, which are all features that adjust sound and Active Noise Cancellation in response to the environment around you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/airpods-adaptive-audio.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955239" /><br/>
Right now, Adaptive Audio is an all or nothing setting, but that's set to change in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple added a "Customize Adaptive Audio" menu that lets you adjust the setting to allow for more or less noise.<br/>
<br/>
When the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware/">latest beta firmware</a> are connected to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, you can open up the AirPods section of the Settings app to see a new Adaptive Audio section.<br/>
<br/>
Tapping into it presents a slider bar where you can adjust Adaptive Audio for Less Noise or More Noise, impacting the Adaptive Audio settings. The feature will mostly apply to Adaptive Noise Control, a feature that blends Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation. It is designed to tweak the level of noise control based on changing conditions in the environment, so being able to set it to allow for more noise or less noise will come in handy.<br/>
<br/>
The setting will also impact Personalized Volume, an option that adjusts the volume of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 based on your personal volume preferences and environmental conditions.<br/>
<br/>
These settings will be widely available to &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 owners when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; launches in the fall. The earbuds will also be able to be adjusted using iPadOS 18 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-adaptive-audio-options/">iOS 18 Adds More Control Over Adaptive Audio on AirPods Pro 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-adds-more-control-over-adaptive-audio-on-airpods-pro-2.2429056/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> has had a Power Reserve function that holds back a small amount of battery life to allow features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> and NFC unlocking to work even when your device has died, and in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple seems to be improving the feature further for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
As demonstrated on Reddit, when the battery on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is exhausted, the phone can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1ddpgb4/ios_18_db1_you_can_now_see_the_time_even_after/">continue to show the time</a> in the upper left corner of the device, which is a small but useful upgrade. The battery icon still shows up, and you'll see "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is Findable" while reserve battery is left. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-iphone-time-off.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955275" /><br/>
It appears that this feature is limited to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models. We tested on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro Max and were not ale to get the time to show up, but it did work as expected with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max. <br/>
<br/>
Power Reserve has been a feature on iPhones dating back to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XR and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS, so it's not clear what the limiting factor is in terms of showing the time on display when the battery has drained on older devices. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-time-no-battery-life/">Your iPhone 15 Can Show the Time When It&#039;s Out of Battery in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/your-iphone-15-can-show-the-time-when-its-out-of-battery-in-ios-18.2429053/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just months after naming AllTrails the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-unveils-app-store-award-winners-the-best-apps-and-games-of-2023/">iPhone App of the Year in 2023</a>, Apple has added new hiking features of its own to the Maps app on iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Hiking-Trails-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955271" /><br/>
Apple Maps users in the U.S. can browse thousands of hikes across all 63 national parks in the country, filtered by length, elevation, and route type. Users can also create and save their own custom walking and hiking routes, with one-way, out-and-back, and loop routing options to choose from where available. <br/>
<br/>
Apple Maps added topographic maps on the Apple Watch with watchOS 10 last year, and these maps are now available on the iPhone too with iOS 18. Topographic maps and hikes can be saved for offline access with turn-by-turn voice guidance.<br/>
<br/>
These features are mostly limited to the U.S., but topographic maps are also available in Japan, according to fine print <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18-preview/">on Apple's website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes all of the features:<blockquote>Apple Maps introduces even more ways to explore the world, including hikes and custom walking routes. Users can browse thousands of hikes across national parks in the United States — filtered by length, elevation, and route type — and save them to use while offline. Users can also create their own custom walking routes with just a few taps to plan everything from a local exercise route to a full-day walking tour in a new city. Additionally, they can save their favorite national park hikes, custom walking routes, and places to an all-new Places Library, and add personal notes about them.</blockquote><em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a> exclusively revealed that these features were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/">coming to Apple Maps on the iPhone</a> earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is currently in beta and should be released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/apple-maps-hiking-features-on-ios-18/">Apple Maps Rivals AllTrails on iOS 18 With New Hiking Features in U.S.</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-rivals-alltrails-on-ios-18-with-new-hiking-features-in-u-s.2429049/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
