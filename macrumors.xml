In terms of third-party deals, Bose this week also began its annual back to school sale with steep discounts on popular audio accessories.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's annual iPhone event is coming up quickly, and things are starting to firm up regarding what we might see and when.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/top-stories-24aug2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962303" /><br/>
Beyond the iPhone and other updates expected next month, we're also looking toward some Mac updates later in the year while Apple appears to be moving forward on its tabletop robot project, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Expected to Debut iPhone 16, Apple Watch 10, and AirPods 4 on September 10</h2><br/>
Apple plans to hold an event to introduce the iPhone 16 models, the next-generation Apple Watch models, and new AirPods <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/apple-to-debut-new-iphones-september-10/">on Tuesday, September 10,</a> according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935160" /><br/>
After the September 10 unveiling, the devices will launch on Friday, September 20. With that timeline, we can expect new software like iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia to come out a few days ahead of the September 20 hardware launch.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 Launch Is Next Month – Here's Everything We Know</h2><br/>
With the iPhone 16 lineup being officially unveiled in just a few weeks, we've <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/iphone-16-launch-everything-we-know/">recapped many of the rumors</a> we've heard about the devices, so check it out for a refresher as Apple's big event approaches.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
We're expecting bigger sizes for the Pro models, a new Capture button, and an array of other improvements. On the color front, we're expecting a new bronze or gold shade potentially called Desert Titanium to replace the Blue Titanium option from the iPhone 15 Pro lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's September Event: New Products to Expect Beyond the iPhone 16</h2><br/>
While the iPhone is always the highlight of Apple's annual September events, the company typically makes a number of other introductions and announcements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Event-October-2023.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919098" /><br/>
We've <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/21/apple-september-2024-event-new-products-expected/">rounded up what else we might see</a> at next month's event, ranging from new Apple Watch models to updated AirPods and more, so check out our full list!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>These New Macs Are Coming in 2024</h2><br/>
With September expected to see the usual iPhone and Apple Watch focus, that doesn't mean Apple is ignoring the Mac lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Silver-Ortho-Cooler.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961274" /><br/>
In fact, Apple is expected to move its entire Mac lineup to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/apple-testing-four-m4-macs/">M4 family of chips</a> over the next ~12 months, with several models expected to see <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/these-new-macs-are-coming-in-2024/">updates before the end of this year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Five New Features in the iOS 18 Phone App</h2><br/>
iOS 18 will see its public release in just about a month, and we're continuing our series of articles looking at updates coming for individual apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Phone-App-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962140" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-phone-app/">One of the apps seeing significant updates is the Phone app</a>, which will allow users to record and transcribe calls, with devices supporting Apple Intelligence also able to summarize transcriptions. You'll also be able to search your call history, see contact suggestions when you start typing numbers on the keypad, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>First Plans for Apple's Tabletop Robot Spotted in Supply Chain</h2><br/>
We've been hearing for some time about Apple's work on a tabletop robot, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/">appears the project is moving forward</a> with a focus on smart home control, videoconferencing, and home security monitoring.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Apple-Robot-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961757" /><br/>
Rumors have suggested the device could launch as soon as 2026, and we're already getting word about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/apple-robot-spotted-in-supply-chain/">Apple's supply chain gearing up</a> to provide components for it.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, the Notes app is set to gain several new features. There aren't many updates to the overall design, but Notes has deeper integrations with other apps that add all kinds of new functionality. There are also a few nifty iPad-only Notes features that involve the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Notes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962295" /><br/>
<h2 id="math_notes">Math Notes</h2><br/>
Notes integrates with the Calculator app in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; for a new feature called Math Notes. Math Notes is designed to let you solve equations, so you can do things like add up your monthly budget, calculate what people owe for a group trip, or split a restaurant bill.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-notes-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957060" /><br/>
Math Notes works directly in the Notes app or in the Math Notes section of the Calculator app. Any equation that you type in is automatically solved when you add an equals sign, and there is support for variables.<br/>
<br/>
If you define several variables, you can then use those definitions in your calculations. If you write dinner = &#36;42, movies = &#36;24, and dessert = &#36;18 in the Notes app, you can then type in dinner + movies + dessert and add an equals sign to get the total. Variables can be used in equations and graphs (with a relevant equation) and adjusted later to change the results.<br/>

You can even do unit conversions with Math Notes. Just type in what you want to convert, and you'll get the result. If you type in 10 euros to pounds in a note and then add an equals sign, the Notes app will give you the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that Math Notes is able to solve all of the same functions as a scientific calculator.<br/>
<br/>
Math Notes is available for math written using Western Arabic numerals and common mathematical symbols, or typed using Arabic (Eastern & Western) and Devanagari numerals and common mathematical symbols.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="math_notes_in_ipados_18">Math Notes in iPadOS 18</h3><br/>
On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, you can use Math Notes with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. Just write out equations by hand and add an equals sign to have the Notes app solve them.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ipados-18-math-notes.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954476" /><br/>
All of the Math Notes features work with handwriting, including unit conversions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="audio_recording_and_transcription">Audio Recording and Transcription</h2><br/>
The Notes app can be used to record any audio, taking advantage of the microphones in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. To record audio, tap on the paperclip icon in the toolbar and then tap on the "Record Audio" button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-app-voice-recording.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962314" /><br/>
From there, tap on the red record button to start a recording, and the stop button to end it. The option to record audio right in the Notes app is useful for lectures, meetings, and more.<br/>
<br/>
All recordings that you capture with the Notes app are automatically transcribed in real-time so you can read through what was recorded and even search for key phrases.<br/>
<br/>
Audio recording and transcribing is available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 and later, but the feature only works in English.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="phone_app_recording">Phone App Recording</h3><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-phone-app/">supports recording phone calls</a>, and when you initiate a recording of a phone call, that recording is stored in the Notes app. Phone app recordings have all of the same functionality as audio recordings made in the Notes app, with transcriptions provided.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960200" /><br/>
<h3 id="transcription_summaries_apple_intelligence">Transcription Summaries (Apple Intelligence)</h3><br/>
Apple Intelligence can be used to summarize a transcript of an audio recording or a recorded phone call in the Notes app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-transcript-summary.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962315" /><br/>
A device that supports Apple Intelligence is required for this feature, and that includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>/Pro Max and later as well as Macs and iPads with an M-series chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="collapsible_sections">Collapsible Sections</h2><br/>
If you have long notes with multiple headings, you can now collapse those headings down to create a more compact note.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-collapsible-headings.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1277" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962316" /><br/>
Any section header can be collapsed, including headings, subheadings, and titles. Just tap on a heading and then tap on the down arrow to collapse it. Tap the arrow again to open it up.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="highlight_colors">Highlight Colors</h2><br/>
The Notes app supports colors for typed text for the first time, allowing for highlighting. Apple added five colors, including pink, purple, orange, mint, and blue, with the colors able to be added through the formatting interface. Just tap on the Aa button to get to the color options when a word or phrase is selected.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Notes-Highlight-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955031" /><br/>
Multiple colors can be used for the same sentence, and the colors can be used for titles and headings, as well as combined with text formatting like bold and italics.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="attach_files">Attach Files</h2><br/>
The toolbar icon that lets you add images or scanned documents to a note has been updated to do more in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. Tapping on it allows you to attach a file from the Files app, which makes it much easier to add documents to a note. You can also use it to record audio, which is another new feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-attach-file.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962317" /><br/>
Before now, you had to copy and paste a file into notes to add it, a process that required several steps.<br/>
<br/>
The prior Choose Photo or Video, Scan Documents, Take Photo or Video, and Scan Text options remain. To denote the new functionality, the icon for the tool is now a paperclip instead of a camera.<br/>
<br/>
As an alternative to using the toolbar, you can long press on a note to attach a file, an option that wasn't previously available.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="notes_settings">Notes Settings</h2><br/>
If you tap on the icon that has three dots at the top right of a note, you can get to the Notes settings, where there are a number of new options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-settings.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962318" /><br/>
You can see Recent Notes from this interface, with the Notes app displaying several of your prior notes for quick access. There's also a toggle for Math Notes for choosing between suggested results and results that are automatically inserted when an equals sign is typed, or turning the feature off.<br/>
<br/>
Prior features for searching through the note, moving the note, adding lines and grids, and changing the attachment view are all still available.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="lock_screen_notes">Lock Screen Notes</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, you can add Control Center controls to the Lock Screen. With this feature, you can add the option to open the Notes app into one of the slots that was previously taken up by the Flashlight and Camera, giving you an option for quickly jotting down your thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-lock-screen.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1251" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962319" /><br/>
You could get to the Notes app from the Lock Screen previously, but it required going through Control Center.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="smart_script_ipados_18">Smart Script (iPadOS 18)</h2><br/>
On the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, there's a new feature called Smart Script that's designed to improve your handwriting with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. The feature uses machine learning to recreate your own handwriting style to refine what you've written, making messy writing look neater.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ipados-18-smart-script.jpg" alt="" width="1900" height="1069" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957164" /><br/>
Smart Script doesn't change your handwriting, but it makes it smoother, straighter, and easier to read.<br/>
<br/>
With Smart Script, you can also paste typed text into your own handwriting, correct handwritten spelling, touch and drag words to move them or change the spacing, and scribble out what you've written to erase it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="writing_tools_apple_intelligence">Writing Tools (Apple Intelligence)</h2><br/>
Writing Tools is an Apple Intelligence feature that can improve your writing. It won't generate text from scratch for you, but it can proofread, help you rewrite to match a specific tone, and create summaries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-writing-tools.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960221" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Proofread text for spelling and grammar errors, including word choice and sentence structure. You can accept all suggestions with a tap or go through them one by one with explanations.</li><br/>
 <li>Rewrite for cleaning up what you've written and shifting the tone without impacting your content. Options include Friendly, Professional, and Concise.</li><br/>
 <li>Options for selecting text and summarizing it. You can choose to create a paragraph, pull out key points, make a list, or create a table. Summaries are available in Mail, Messages, and more.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
To use Writing Tools in the Notes app, all you need to do is write something, select your text, and then tap on the quick access Writing Tools options at the top of the keyboard or select Writing Tools by tapping on your selected text.<br/>
<br/>
Writing Tools won't be available when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> launch, but the feature will be coming in iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 updates that we expect to see in October.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="image_wand_apple_intelligence">Image Wand (Apple Intelligence)</h2><br/>
The Notes app is designed to integrate with Image Playground, Apple's upcoming AI-powered image generation app. You will be able to have the Notes app create an image that goes along with what you've typed up, and on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, you can make a rough sketch of what you want to include and then have Apple Intelligence generate a more polished version.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-intelligence-image-wand.jpg" alt="" width="1640" height="995" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962313" /><br/>
The feature that adds images into the Notes app is called Image Wand, and it's not yet clear when it will be implemented.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has ramped up testing of four new Mac models equipped with an M4 chip, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-23/when-is-apple-announcing-the-iphone-16-apple-planning-event-on-sept-10-2024"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple is planning to refresh the MacBook Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> with M4 chips this year, and we could see the new models sometime in October.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Black-Ortho-Cooler.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961271" /><br/>
The four machines have base-level M4 chips, according to developer logs. Three of the Macs have a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The fourth machine has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU, which is not an M4 configuration that we've seen so far. All four of the M4 Macs have either 16GB or 32GB of Unified Memory.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 used in the 256GB and 512GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models has a 9-core CPU and 10-core GPU, while the chip used in the 1TB and 2TB models has a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> chip is the same chip that will be in some of the Mac models.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does not mention M4 Pro or M4 Max chips, which would be used in higher-end &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; and 14-inch MacBook Pro models, as well as the 16-inch MacBook Pro. M4 Pro and M4 Max chips would have a higher number of CPU and GPU cores, as well as more maximum memory.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if Apple is only introducing lower-end models with the standard M4 chip, or if there are plans for M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max models but those higher-end chips simply weren't seen in the developer logs.<br/>
<br/>
Prior rumors have suggested that both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models would see a refresh, and Gurman previously said that the new, slimmer &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; that's in the works <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/">will be available</a> with both M4 and M4 Pro chip options.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/apple-testing-four-m4-macs/">Apple Testing Four New M4 Macs Ahead of Fall Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-testing-four-new-m4-macs-ahead-of-fall-launch.2434245/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to hold an event to introduce the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, the next-generation Apple Watch models, and new AirPods on Tuesday, September 10, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-23/when-is-apple-announcing-the-iphone-16-apple-planning-event-on-sept-10-2024"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
After the September 10 unveiling, the devices will launch on Friday, September 20. With that timeline, we can expect new software like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> to come out a few days ahead of the September 20 hardware launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet officially announced the date for its September event, with Gurman instead citing sources familiar with Apple's plans. Apple is expected to send out media invites as soon as next week.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will include more powerful A18 chips that work with Apple Intelligence, and the entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is expected to support the new &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; update. Apple plans to make the display of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max slightly bigger, and all four models will get a new Capture Button for taking photos.<br/>
<br/>
Standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will adopt the Action Button for the first time, and there is an improved Ultra Wide 48-megapixel camera coming to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Apple Watch models, we are expecting an Apple Watch Series 10, a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, and a refreshed Apple Watch Ultra. There are design changes in the works for the standard Apple Watch, with Apple set to introduce a thinner design and larger displays.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a> are coming as well, with Apple planning to debut two models for the first time. The lower-end model will be similar to the current AirPods, while the higher-end version will include Active Noise Cancellation.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta has canceled work on a high-end mixed reality headset that it was developing to compete with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, reports <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-cancels-high-end-mixed-reality-headset">The Information</a></em>. Meta this week told employees to quit working on the device following a product review meeting that involved Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg" alt="" width="1385" height="779" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914163" /><br/>
The now-canceled device was slated for launch in 2027, and it was meant to be equipped with high-resolution micro OLED displays, which is what Apple used for the Vision Pro. Meta was aiming to sell the device for under &#36;1,000, but that was not going to be possible with the high cost of the displays.<br/>
<br/>
Meta is continuing development on the Quest 4, a successor to the Quest 3, and that headset could come out in 2026. The Quest 3 is priced at &#36;500, which is also the likely target price point for its successor. Meta is also focusing on software rather than hardware, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/meta-expands-vr-operating-system/">announced a Horizon OS platform</a> for third-party hardware makers earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
When the Vision Pro launched, Meta was hoping that the device would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/meta-optimistic-vision-pro-launch/">reinvigorate the headset market</a> and validate Zuckerberg's major push into the AR/VR space. Instead, Apple has struggled with consumer appeal, and interest in the Vision Pro has waned over time.<br/>
<br/>
Enthusiasm about the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/">started dying down</a> just a month after it launched, and fewer customers visited Apple retail stores for demonstrations. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-cuts-vision-pro-shipments/">cut Vision Pro shipments</a> in April, and the company is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/">unlikely to sell</a> even 500,000 of the headsets in 2024. As a result, Apple has stopped work on a second-generation high-cost Vision Pro and is instead focusing on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2/">creating a lower-cost model</a> with fewer features and a price closer to high-end iPhones.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/meta-cancels-high-end-headset/">Meta Cancels High-End Mixed Reality Headset After Apple Vision Pro Struggles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-cancels-high-end-mixed-reality-headset-after-apple-vision-pro-struggles.2434241/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've <a href="https://southernstraps.com/">teamed up with Southern Straps</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>. Southern Straps has been <a href="https://southernstraps.com/collections/nylon-bands-for-apple-watch">making high-quality bands</a> for the Apple Watch for almost a decade now, and the company's selection of bands offer a great alternative to Apple's own bands, in styles that Apple does not offer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-3.jpg" alt="" width="3415" height="1921" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915893" /><br/>
Southern Straps has a wide selection of nylon bands that pair a comfortable design with a classic watch band style. After the Apple Watch came out in 2015, Southern Straps was the first company to make nylon Apple Watch bands, and with so many years of experience, it has had time to perfect the band design and construction.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://southernstraps.com/collections/nylon-bands-for-apple-watch">Priced at &#36;29</a>, each Apple Watch band is made from a single piece of nylon that is doubled over, heat sealed, and stitched together for durability. The multi-step process makes sure that every band is going to hold up for multiple years to come, and there is a five-year warranty on bands.<br/>
<br/>

There are 11 color options, ranging from solid colors in green, black, and sand, to striped options in aesthetic color combinations like blue and green, blue and orange, khaki and red, blue and white, black and gray, and the classic red, white, and blue.<br/>
<br/>
Bands can be ordered with custom hardware in black, silver, or gold to match different Apple Watch models. There are two sizes: one that is compatible with 42mm to 49mm Apple Watch models, and one that is compatible with smaller 38mm to 41mm models. The bands are compatible with every Apple Watch model from the original Apple Watch to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Pegged spring bars are included with each band so that you're able to change the hardware if you get an Apple Watch in a new size or a new color. Southern Straps bands can be used on a daily basis for everything from work to working out.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Macs are less targeted by malware than Windows PCs, but that doesn't mean they are immune. Increasingly, insidious types of Mac malware are being developed that have researchers concerned enough to issue public warnings, and that's the case again today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macos-cthulu-stealer-malware.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="546" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962263" /><br/>
As reported by <em><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/new-macos-malware-cthulhu-stealer.html">Hacker News</a></em>, Cado Security has identified a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) targeting macOS users named "Cthulhu Stealer." First spotted in late 2023, the malicious software is designed to steal sensitive information from infected Macs, such as saved passwords from iCloud Keychain, information from web browsers, and even details from Telegram accounts. <br/>
<br/>
What's particularly concerning is that it's being sold as a service on the dark web for &#36;500 per month, potentially allowing multiple bad actors to use it against unsuspecting Mac owners.<br/>
<br/>
Cato Security researcher Tara Gould <a href="https://www.cadosecurity.com/blog/from-the-depths-analyzing-the-cthulhu-stealer-malware-for-macos">reports</a> that Cthulhu Stealer disguises itself as popular software to trick users into installing it. It might appear as CleanMyMac, <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em>, or even Adobe GenP (a tool some users employ to bypass Adobe's subscription model). The malware comes packaged as a disk image (DMG) file.<br/>
<br/>
If a user tries to open the fake app, macOS's built-in security feature, Gatekeeper, warns that the software is unsigned. But if a user chooses to bypass this warning, the malware immediately asks for the user's system password, mimicking a legitimate system prompt. This technique isn't new – other Mac malware like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/28/atomic-macos-stealer-malware/">Atomic Stealer</a> and MacStealer use similar tricks.<br/>
<br/>
Once it has the necessary permissions, Cthulhu Stealer can access and steal a wide range of sensitive data. For crypto users, it specifically targets MetaMask digital wallet information. All of this stolen data is then sent to the attackers' servers.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, reports suggest that whoever designed Cthulu Stealer is no longer active, apparently following disputes over payments and accusations of scamming their own customers, i.e. other cybercriminals who were using the malware.<br/>
<br/>
While Cthulhu Stealer isn't the most sophisticated malware out there, it's still a significant threat to Mac users who might be tricked into installing it. General security pointers include only downloading software from trusted sources like the App Store or official developer websites, being wary of any app asking for your system password during installation, and keeping your Mac updated with the latest security patches from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
In macOS Sequoia, expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/macos-sequoia-mid-september-launch-date/">released in mid-September</a>, Apple plans to remove the ability to easily override Gatekeeper warnings by Control-clicking. Instead, users will need to go through System Settings to allow unsigned software to run, adding an extra step that might make users think twice before running potentially dangerous apps.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/malware/">Malware</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/cthulu-stealer-macos-malware/">&#039;Cthulhu Stealer&#039; macOS Malware Can Steal Keychain Passwords, Web Browsing Info, Crypto Wallets, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cthulhu-stealer-macos-malware-can-steal-keychain-passwords-web-browsing-info-crypto-wallets-and-more.2434227/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a>, once the dominant platform for podcast listening, is experiencing a significant decline in popularity as competitors like YouTube and Spotify gain ground, according to a recent study by <a href="https://www.westwoodone.com/blog/2024/07/08/youtubes-growth-as-a-podcast-power-player-revealed-in-cumulus-media-and-signal-hill-insights-podcast-download-spring-2024-report/">Cumulus Media and Signal Hill Insights</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/4-Apple-Podcasts-Hero.png" alt="" width="2612" height="1468" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-817180" /><br/>
"Podcast" is a <a href="https://archive.ph/20120710232048/http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k1967&pageid=icb.page23750">portmanteau</a> of "iPod" and "broadcast," indicating the format's indebtedness to Apple. However, the study reveals that the podcast landscape has changed dramatically since the company first popularized the medium in 2005 with the release of iTunes 4.9. YouTube is now the most popular platform for podcast consumption in the United States, with 31% of respondents reporting it as their primary choice. Spotify follows at 21%, while &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; has dropped to third place with only 12% of the market share.<br/>
<br/>
This is in stark contrast to Apple's position just a few years ago. In July 2019, 29% of weekly podcast listeners primarily used &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj;. Several factors appear to be contributing to &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj;' waning popularity. &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; didn't generate direct revenue for the company until recently, when in 2021 it introduced podcast subscriptions, of which Apple takes a cut.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; was historically not available on Android or Windows devices, limiting its reach, although the launch earlier this week of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/apple-podcasts-now-available-on-the-web/">Apple Podcasts web app</a> may go some way to mitigate this issue.<br/>
<br/>
The rising popularity of video podcasts has also given platforms like YouTube a significant advantage, while &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; has shown no willingness to push video at all. Indeed, it's unclear whether the company is working on any major updates or features to compete more effectively with the more visual take on the medium offered by YouTube and Spotify.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the decline, &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; still has the advantage of coming pre-installed on all Apple devices, giving it a large potential user base. However, Apple may need to rethink its strategy by emphasizing video podcast content, adding more monetization options for podcasters, and attracting new and younger listeners to the platform.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple's Podcasts app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/ios-18-podcasts-scrubbing-chapters/">now shows chapter segments</a> of a podcast when you scrub through a currently playing episode, making it easier to browse through the audio content, but there are no major new podcast features in the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/apple-podcasts-losing-market-share/">Apple Podcasts Losing Market Share to YouTube and Spotify</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-podcasts-losing-market-share-to-youtube-and-spotify.2434226/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Maps is rolling out a redesigned bottom bar to iPhones that aims to give the app a less cluttered look by reducing the number of tabs on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/google-maps-ui-change.jpg" alt="" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962247" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Old Google Maps bottom bar (left) vs. new one</em></div><br/>
Previously only on Android, the new bottom bar reduces the number of tabs from five to three. As spotted by <em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/22/google-maps-bottom-bar-redesign-iphone/">9to5Google</a></em>, "Go" has been removed, but users can still access it using a new "You" middle tab, via a new "Saved trips" section therein.<br/>
<br/>
"You" was previously called "Saved," and retains the same bookmark icon. But tapping it takes you to an updated page with new top tabs for "Notifications" and "Messages," both of which serve content that was previously found in the "Updates" tab, now removed. That leaves "Contribute" as the last tab of the three on the main maps screen.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/apple-maps-vs-google-maps/">Apple Maps vs. Google Maps: Which Is Better?</a></li></ul><br/>
The rollout is occurring in version 6.129.1 of Google Maps. If you've updated and don't see the new bottom bar, try force-quitting the app via the app switcher screen and then re-open it, which worked for us.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/google-maps-bottom-bar-redesign-ios/">Google Maps Loses Two Tabs Out of Five in Bottom Bar Redesign</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-loses-two-tabs-out-of-five-in-bottom-bar-redesign.2434219/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Instagram has announced a new feature that allows users to add a song to their profile, an update that harks back to Myspace in the early 2000s.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/instagram-song-on-profile.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962242" /> <br/>
Added music appears in the bio area of a user's profile. Unlike Myspace, the songs don't autoplay when someone visits a user's profile. Visitors can play and pause the song - or song sample, since the duration of the music is capped at 30 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
"We're excited to announce that you can now add a song to your profile, giving you more ways to express yourself through music," Instagram said in a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@creators/post/C--rFylx7Be">post</a> from its creators account. "Your profile song selection will be live until you swap out the song."<br/>
<br/>
To add a song, users need to go to the "edit profile" page and select "Add music to your profile," where they can search for and select a track from Instagram's library of licensed music (the same music that can be used in Reels or posts).<br/>
<br/>
The new feature is being launched in collaboration with singer Sabrina Carpenter, whose profile features a teaser of her new song, "Taste," ahead of its official release later this week. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/instagram-song-on-profile-feature/">Instagram Gains Myspace-Style &#039;Song on Profile&#039; Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-gains-myspace-style-song-on-profile-feature.2434217/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Phone app doesn't often get updated, but with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and Apple Intelligence, it's getting a major overhaul that includes one of the best new features in the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; software.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Phone-App-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962140" /><br/>
This guide highlights everything new with the Phone app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="record_phone_calls">Record Phone Calls</h2><br/>
After placing or answering a call on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running iOS 18.1, you can initiate a recording that gives you an audio copy of the call.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" alt="" width="5416" height="3047" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" /><br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open the Phone app.</li><br/>
 <li>Make a call.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on the record button in the top left corner to start a recording.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
When you tap on the record button, everyone on the call is informed that the call is being recorded through an audible message. The message repeats for each person that is recording, so if two &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users are on a call and both record, the message will play twice.<br/>
<br/>
There is no confirmation dialogue when a call is being recorded, so someone who does not want to be recorded would need to hang up the call as there is no opt out.<br/>
<br/>
While the call is in progress, audio is recorded and saved to the Notes app for later access. When you open up the Notes app, you'll see a Call Recording labeled with the date and the time with an option to tap on Play to repeat the call or to tap into the note for more information.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="transcribe_and_summarize_phone_calls">Transcribe and Summarize Phone Calls</h2><br/>
Calls that are saved in the Notes app are automatically transcribed, so you can see a full transcription of what was said on the call. You can get to a transcription by tapping into a Call Recording note.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960200" /><br/>
As you listen to the call, the transcript will update so you can read along with what's being said.<br/>
<br/>
Transcriptions have a "Summary" button so you can get a quick summary of what was said in the call, plus there is a search option for searching for key words and phrases. Note that the Summary function requires an Apple Intelligence-compatible device, but recording and transcribing are general features available to everyone. <br/>
<br/>
Transcripts can be added to a different note, or copied, and the audio can be saved to the Files app or shared.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="search_call_history">Search Call History</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, Apple added a search feature for the Recents tab, which means you can now search through all of your incoming and outgoing calls and voicemails.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-phone-app-call-history-search.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962170" /><br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open up the Phone app.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on the Recents tab.</li><br/>
 <li>Search for the person or number you're looking for with the search bar at the top of the interface.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
You can type in phone numbers or names to see calls that have been placed, received, or missed, and contacts that have the name or phone number you're searching for.<br/>
<br/>
Along with name or phone number, you can search for the date of a call, the type of call (such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>), or use multiple search parameters. If you wanted to see all calls from Eric in June, for example, you could type in "Eric" tap the name when it comes up to set the parameter, and then add in "June" to the search bar.<br/>
<br/>
There are options to "See All" calls and voicemails when conducting a search to view more results.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="swap_sim_cards">Swap SIM cards</h2><br/>
If you have two SIMs on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, such as for personal and work purposes, you can swap between them using a Control Center toggle. In prior versions of iOS, you had to change numbers using the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
To swap numbers, open up Control Center, navigate to the connectivity controls, and long press on Cellular Data.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="contact_suggestions">Contact Suggestions</h2><br/>
When you start typing in a number with the Keypad in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, you'll see a list of contacts so you can quickly get to who you want to call.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-auto-fill-phone-app-dialing.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962169" /><br/>
Type in the first digit or two of a number and then tap on the "More" icon to see all of your options. You can tap one from there to dial.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="t9_dialing">T9 Dialing</h2><br/>
Related to the contact suggestion feature, you can actually search for names instead of numbers using T9 characters. If you have a contact in your phone under "Eric," you can type in 3 for E, 7 for R, 4 for I, and 2 for C, and the contact card for Eric will pop up.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-phone-app-t9-dialing.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962168" /><br/>
T9 dialing dates back to the days before touchscreens, allowing smartphone users to type using predictive text that associated numbers with letters. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has not supported T9 dialing until now.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="phone_app_release_info">Phone App Release Info</h2><br/>
Call recording and transcribing are &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; features that will be available to anyone, but the functionality won't be added to iOS devices until iOS 18.1. Summarizing transcripts is an Apple Intelligence feature that will be limited to devices compatible with Apple Intelligence. That includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, as well as M-series iPads and Macs. <br/>
<br/>

		<title>macOS Sequoia Slated to Launch in Mid-September Alongside iOS 18</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, the newest version of the operating system that runs on the Mac, is set to launch in mid-September, <em>MacRumors</em> has learned. While Apple's iOS updates are consistently introduced in September, macOS launch dates vary, and new Mac updates have been released in September, October, and November in recent years.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macOS-Sequoia-Night-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961501" /><br/>
This year, Apple plans to release &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; around the same time as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> rather than holding it until October. Introducing both updates at the same time will ensure that cross-platform features are functional and working as intended, such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring. A key new feature, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring allows an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; to be controlled using a Mac running &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features coming to &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; include refreshed window tiling capabilities, a dedicated Passwords app, and updates to Safari, Messages, Maps, Notes, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features will not be in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; or &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; at launch, with Apple instead introducing the functionality in subsequent iOS 18.1 and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 updates. We expect to see those updates released in October.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is in the final stages of beta testing &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; and &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; ahead of its annual fall iPhone-focused event. If Apple sticks with the timing that it has used for the last several years, the most likely event date is September 10. If that's the event date, new iPhones could launch a week later on September 20. New iOS updates typically come out on the Wednesday before new iPhones launch, so with that timeline, we could see &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; on September 18.<br/>
<br/>
There is some wiggle room with dates, though, and Apple could opt to hold the event later in September, which would change the software launch date guesstimate. Apple could announce its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; event as soon as next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/macos-sequoia-mid-september-launch-date/">macOS Sequoia Slated to Launch in Mid-September Alongside iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-slated-to-launch-in-mid-september-alongside-ios-18.2434189/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is a freemium app that Nintendo has regularly been adding new content to through ongoing events, so there are players with money invested in the game.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/10/animalcrossingpocketcamp.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="514" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598832" /><br/>
There will be no more events or updates with the Pocket Camp service being discontinued, but Nintendo will release a paid version of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp so that existing users can continue to play an offline version of the game. The paid version will allow saves to be transferred over, but it will not support visiting and interacting with other players or receiving gifts. It will not have in-app purchases nor will it require an online connection.<br/>
<br/>
Pocket Camp users who have purchased Leaf Tickets, the in-game currency, can redeem them through November 28. Leaf Tickets not used by that date will expire. Pocket Camp Club subscriptions will be ending on October 28, but Nintendo will continue providing the associated benefits until Pocket Camp shuts down.<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo plans to release the paid version of the app when the existing freemium version is shut down, but pricing has not yet been announced. Transferring a Pocket Camp save to the new app requires linking to a Nintendo Account.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nintendo/">Nintendo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/nintendo-shutting-down-animal-crossing-pocket-camp/">Nintendo Shutting Down Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp App, Plans to Release Paid Offline Version</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nintendo-shutting-down-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-app-plans-to-release-paid-offline-version.2434185/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a new firmware update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, including both the Lightning and USB-C versions. The firmware has a build number of 7A5290a, up from 7A5266c, and it is available to developers at the current time. This is the fourth firmware update that Apple has released since announcing new &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 features in June.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803705" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/AirPods-Pro-Beta-Firmware.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" /><br/>
There are multiple features that are coming to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and these features are included in the firmware update.<br/>
<br/>
With head gestures, users can control <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; with a shake or a nod of the head. If you get a phone call, for example, you can shake your head no if you don't want to answer it, or nod to accept the call. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interactions can be used for responding to incoming messages, calls, and notifications.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is adding Voice Isolation to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; to cut down on loud background sounds to make you easier to hear, and there is a new Personalized Spatial Audio feature specific to gaming. Game developers will be able to incorporate spatial audio into their games for a more immersive audio experience.<br/>
<br/>
The new firmware is limited to developers at the current time, but it will be available to all &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; users following the public launch of the new software.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware-4/">Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 Beta Firmware With Support for iOS 18 Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware-with-support-for-ios-18-features.2434184/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began sending out emails to customers letting them know about upcoming changes that are being made to the Apple Cash Terms and Conditions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-tap-to-cash.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957059" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a> introduce Tap to Cash, a feature that allows users to exchange Apple Cash in person by holding an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or Apple Watch near another &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or Apple Watch. As part of this feature implementation, Apple is changing the identity verification rules surrounding Apple Cash.<br/>
<br/>
Starting on October 4, Apple will require that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch users verify their identity to send more than a total of &#36;500 in peer-to-peer transfers, which includes sending Apple Cash via Messages and making Tap to Cash payments. Identity verification is required whether sending money from an Apple Cash balance or from a supported card in the Wallet app. Prior transactions will count toward the limit that will trigger identity verification.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109312">already requires</a> identity verification for Apple Cash for those who use the feature frequently. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109312">Apple's support document</a> says that users cannot add or receive &#36;500 or more in total without identity verification, so it sounds like verification will also be required when sending large amounts of money as of October.<br/>
<br/>
Identify verification for Apple Cash involves taking photos of a driver's license or ID card, as well as answering personal history questions and providing information like home address, date of birth, and social security number.<br/>
<br/>
Identity verification for sending payments makes sense as Tap to Cash will allow money to be exchanged without being accompanied by personal information like phone number. Tap to Cash is designed for private in-person transactions where Apple Cash is exchanged. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's email to customers also says that it is adding the Vision Pro as a supported device for Apple Cash and that weekly peer-to-peer transfer limits will apply to transfers that are sent as well as received. Apple allows users to send or receive a maximum of &#36;10,000 <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109305">within a 7-day period</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-cash/">Apple Cash</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-cash/">Tap to Cash</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/apple-cash-identity-verification-october/">Apple to Require Identity Verification for Sending &#36;500+ in Apple Cash Starting in October</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-require-identity-verification-for-sending-500-in-apple-cash-starting-in-october.2434173/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup will feature a significant number of new camera features and capabilities, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/08/22/exclusive-every-iphone-16-iphone-16-pro-camera-spec-capture-button-detail-revealed"><em>AppleInsider</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Cameras.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913544" /><br/>
Both the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models are rumored to step up the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s photography and videography functions, including upgraded hardware such as 48-megapixel sensor on the Pro models' ultra wide camera and software such as macro photography for the standard models and an all-new image format. Reiterating some previous rumors, the report claims that:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li>The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;'s main camera will remain the same as that of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> with a 48-megapixel sensor and a f/1.6 aperture, and there are unlikely to be changes to the unit on subsequent generations through to 2026.</li><br/>
	<li>The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;'s ultra wide camera will gain a f/2.2 aperture, up from the f/2.4 aperture on the previous generation, to improve low-light performance.</li><br/>
	<li>The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus may support macro photography for the first time. The feature is currently exclusive to the Pro models. </li><br/>
	<li>The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will continue to feature a 48-megapixel main camera with an f/1.78 aperture.</li><br/>
	<li>The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; will gain the 5x tetraprism telephoto camera introduced on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max last year, replacing the current 3x telephoto camera. </li><br/>
	<li>The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will feature an upgraded ultra wide camera with a 48-megapixel sensor, with the same pixel-binning feature as the main camera. It will have an f/2.2 aperture, up from f/2.4, for significantly improved low-light performance and support 48-megapixel ProRaw photography.</li><br/>
	<li>Apple will introduce a new image format called "JPEG-XL," sitting alongside HEIF, JPEG, HEIF Max, ProRaw, and ProRAW Max.</li><br/>
	<li>The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will support 3K video at 120 frames per second with Dolby Vision.</li><br/>
	<li>A new capacitive "Capture" button will be introduced on all four models, designed to be used exclusively by camera apps. Users will apparently be able to select which camera app the button opens, including third-party ones.</li><br/>
	<li>The Capture button offers a force-sensitive half-press tied to a developer API that could, for example, lock exposure and focus, before fully depressing the button to take a photo.</li><br/>
	<li>Sliding along the capacitive button will also perform different actions. This gesture will tout a developer API.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is expected to be announced in just a matter of weeks. The Pro models are expected to feature larger display sizes and a faster chip, while the standard models are set to offer the Action button and a redesigned rear camera array.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared new ads focusing on <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/">Final Cut Pro 10.8</a>, the latest version of the Apple-designed app for professional video editing. The first ad highlights Final Cut Pro for the Mac, while the second covers Final Cut Pro for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Final Cut Pro 10.8 Apple Pro Apps" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dy3k9M8kqu0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>

Both videos walk through the different features that are available in Final Cut Pro on the Mac and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The Mac video walks through different tools for adding effects and organizing footage, while the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; ad shows off the touch-based gestures and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> integration.<br/>
<br/>
With Final Cut Pro 10.8, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/final-cut-pro-major-update/">came out in June</a>, Apple added Enhance Light and Color, an feature that improves color, color balance, contrast, and brightness in one step. Slo-Mo, another AI feature, blends the frames of video intelligently to provide higher-quality movement.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also introduced Final Cut Camera, an app that can capture video from multiple iOS devices and feed it into Final Cut Pro for a multicam experience.<br/>
<br/>
Final Cut Pro is priced at &#36;300 for the Mac version, and &#36;49 per year or &#36;4.99 per month for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; version. Apple offers a free 90-day trial.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/final-cut-pro/">Final Cut Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/apple-final-cut-pro-mac-ipad-ad/">Apple Promotes Final Cut Pro for Mac and iPad in New Ad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-promotes-final-cut-pro-for-mac-and-ipad-in-new-ad.2434166/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple to Let EU Users Set New Defaults for Multiple Apps, Delete App Store, Photos, Messages and More</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">making additional changes</a> to its app ecosystem in the European Union to comply with the terms of the Digital Markets Act. The default browser selection experience that's already in place will be updated, Apple will allow EU users to set defaults for more types of apps, and core iOS apps like Messages and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> will also be deletable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners in the EU can already set different defaults for the browser, mail app, app marketplace, and contactless payments, but Apple is going to allow users to select new defaults for phone calls, messaging, password managers, keyboards, call spam filters, navigation, and translation. That means, for example, that EU users will be able to choose an app like WhatsApp instead of Messages to be their default texting app, or a mapping app like Waze to be the default instead of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet provided insight into just how setting a new default will work for messaging apps, navigation, password managers, and more, and the company plans to provide more information as the launch date for these features approaches. New defaults for phone calls, messaging, password managers, spam call filters, and keyboards will be able to be set starting with an update to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> coming later this year, while the option to set different navigation and translation defaults will be implemented in spring 2025.<br/>
<br/>
To handle the multitude of new default apps that can be set, Apple is adding a Default Apps section to the Settings app. It will list all of the defaults available to each user for easy management.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/eu-ios-18-default-apps-settings.jpg" alt="" width="1432" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962200" /><br/>
Along with setting new apps as defaults, Apple will let users delete core apps. The &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, Messages, Camera, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, and Safari apps will be able to be deleted, so it's essentially just the Settings and Phone apps that will not be able to be removed in the EU. If a user deletes the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; app, it will be able to be reinstalled from the Settings app if desired, while the other apps can be reinstalled from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
With iOS 17.4, EU users were able to select a default browser from a randomized list of the top 12 browsers in their country. In a future update to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, the browser choice window will pop up again if a user has Safari set as their default. The new browser selection experience will include a descriptive line about the browser, as well as the option to set a default browser right from the choice window. If a user selects a browser that is already installed on their device, it will open automatically, otherwise there will be a downloading icon and the browser will open after it's downloaded. Users will also need to scroll through the full list of available browser options before being able to make a selection.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/eu-ios-18-default-browser-choice.jpg" alt="" width="1928" height="882" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962201" /><br/>
Note that the option to set a default browser will only show up again for users who have Safari as the default, so if an EU user has already selected Chrome, the choice window will not pop up again with the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; update coming later in the year. Users will also see the selection interface on all of their devices rather than just one, and it will show up when Safari is opened for the first time after updating. Setting a new default when Safari is on the user's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or Dock will see the new default browser replace the Safari icon.<br/>
<br/>
The browser default popup will also be displayed when migrating to a new device if the user previously had Safari set as the default.<br/>
<br/>
The changes that Apple is making are applicable for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users in the European Union with updates to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and will not be available in other countries like the United States.<br/>
<br/>
