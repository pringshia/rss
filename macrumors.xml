		<description><![CDATA[Apple TV+ will <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/09/apple-tv-streams-beloved-peanuts-specials-for-free-this-holiday-season/">once again</a> be making the iconic "Peanuts" specials available to non-subscribers for a limited time this holiday season.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Peanuts-Pumpkin.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1104" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968126" /><br/>
Here is when each special will be available to stream for free in the Apple TV app:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown": Saturday, October 19 and Sunday, October 20</li><br/>
<li>"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving": Saturday, November 23 and Sunday, November 24</li><br/>
<li>"A Charlie Brown Christmas": Saturday, December 14 and Sunday, December 15</li></ul>Apple TV+ subscribers can already watch the specials at any time of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple holds the rights to "Peanuts" content through a deal with distributor WildBrain, and this will be the fourth consecutive year that the specials air on Apple TV+. Not everyone has been a fan of this exclusivity, with a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/wildbrain-studios-bring-the-peanuts-specials-back-to-broadcast-tv">petition</a> calling for the specials to return to broadcast TV networks having received nearly 270,000 signatures <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/27/peanuts-wildbrain-apple-tv-plus-petition/">since 2020</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/18/apple-peanuts-specials-airing-pbs/">allow the "Peanuts" specials to air on PBS</a> in 2020 and 2021, but not since then.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/25/apple-tv-plus-peanuts-holiday-specials/">Apple TV+ to Stream &#039;Peanuts&#039; Holiday Specials for Free Again This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-to-stream-peanuts-holiday-specials-for-free-again-this-year.2438121/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last week launched watchOS 11, the latest major software update for compatible Apple Watch models, as well as the new Apple Watch Series 10 and a black version of the second-generation Apple Watch Ultra, both of which come with watchOS 11 pre-installed. New watchOS 11 features include Workout and Activity Ring updates, a Vitals app, new watch faces, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/25-Hidden-Features-in-watchOS-11-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967898" /><br/>
In this article, we've listed 25 features and enhancements in Apple's new smartwatch software, many of which may have gone under your radar. Bear in mind that ‌watchOS 11 requires Apple Watch Series 6 or later and an iPhone XS or later with iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="1._digital_crown_for_notifications">1. Digital Crown for Notifications</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/digital-crown-notifications.jpg" alt="notifications" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968065" /><br/>
Previously in watchOS 10, you had to swipe down on your Apple Watch watch face to view notifications, indicated by the red dot at the top of the screen. This method still works in watchOS 11, but now you can alternatively turn the Digital Crown downwards to reveal them and quickly scroll through. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2._check_in">2. Check In</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/check-in-watchos-11.jpg" alt="messages" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968066" /><br/>
Check In lets you automatically notify a friend or loved one when you’ve arrived at a destination. Apple introduced Check In on iPhone in iOS 17, but it didn't feature in last year's watchOS 10 update for Apple Watch. Thankfully, Apple has rectified the omission in watchOS 11, and you can now start a Check In from Messages by entering your destination or arrival time (via the + button). What's more, you can start a Check In when doing an outdoor workout, which is handy if you're going for a run after dark.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/check-in-workout.jpg" alt="workout" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968069" /><br/>
When you start a workout in the Workout app, swipe right to reveal the Start/Pause, New, and Segment options. Below these, you'll find the new Check In option. When starting a Check In, you'll be asked to define when you should be prompted to Check In with someone – when you arrive home, after a timer, or when the workout ends. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="3._pause_activity_rings">3. Pause Activity Rings</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/watchos-11-pause-rings.jpg" alt="activity" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968068" /><br/>
Apple Watch now lets you pause your activity goals if you need to rest up. Tap the main Activity Rings display on your Apple Watch, and you'll see a new Pause Rings option that mutes coaching and goal tracking while maintaining your Move streak. So if you're aiming for a streak and something unexpected upends your efforts (if you fall ill, for example) you can pause tracking without losing out and having to start again. Pause options include for today, for a week, until next month, and custom (you can pause your rings for up to 90 days).<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="4._new_watch_faces">4. New Watch Faces</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/photos-watch-face.jpg" alt="watch app" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968071" /><br/>
The Photos watch face has been redesigned in watchOS 11, and can now search photos in your library, analyze them using machine learning, and select the best compositions, framing, and image quality for your watch. You can also customize the time size and layout (including complications), as well as choose your favorite font.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/watchos-11-new-faces.jpg" alt="watch face" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968072" /><br/>
Elsewhere, there are two additional watch faces in watchOS 11: Flux and Reflections. Flux changes color as a horizontal line representing the seconds dial travels up the screen and switches up the number style with each new minute. Meanwhile, Reflections can be switched between a circular and fullscreen style. Neither watch face supports complications, but they do look neat. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="5._sync_maps_to_watch">5. Sync Maps to Watch</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/offline-maps-apple-watch.jpg" alt="maps" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968074" /><br/>
In iOS 18, the Maps app features detailed trail networks and hikes, including all 63 U.S. national parks. If you add a trail, hike, or custom route to your maps Library and download it to your iPhone for offline use, you can also opt to sync it to your Apple Watch, where you'll get turn-by-turn directions. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="6._action_button_quick_menu">6. Action Button Quick Menu</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/action-button-long-press.jpg" alt="action button" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968075" /><br/>
In Settings, you can assign various functions to the Action button, but in watchOS 11 you can also do this just by long pressing the Action button.<br/>
<br/>
This will bring up a menu that includes Workout, Stopwatch, Waypoint, Backtrack, Dive, Flashlight, Shortcut, Voice Memo, Translate, Accessibility, and Recognize Music. Selecting a function will automatically assign it to the button so that it works next time you press it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="7._workout_effort">7. Workout Effort</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/workout-effort-1.jpg" alt="workout" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968076" /><br/>
After completing most cardio-focused workouts in the Workout app, you'll receive a prompt to rate your effort or edit your estimated effort, indicating how hard you exercised. Your pace, elevation, heart rate, and personal data like age, height, and weight are factored into each rating. The effort metric is used to calculate your training load over time (see below). If you don't want to rate your effort, turn off the Effort Reminder switch, which can be found in Settings ➝ Workout.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="8._training_load_">8. Training Load </h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/training-load-watchos-11.jpg" alt="training load" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968077" /><br/>
The new Training load feature compares the intensity (calculated by the effort metric) and duration of your workouts over the last seven days to what you've done over the previous 28 days. It then classifies your current training load on a scale from well below to well above — to help you understand the relative strain on your body and decide if it's sustainable. <br/>
<br/>
Training load is also matched with your overnight Vitals readings (see feature number 19) to give you a better idea of whether you're under-training or overdoing it. You can review your training load in the Activity app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="9._music_recognition">9. Music Recognition</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/music-recognition-watch.jpg" alt="shazam" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968078" /><br/>
Shazam now comes pre-installed in watchOS 11 under the moniker "Music Recognition," where you can identify songs playing in the environment and access previously recognized songs, which are synced across your iPhone. There's also an option to enable Music Detection in the Smart Stack, which will make Music Recognition a suggested widget when music is playing in your vicinity.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="10._tides_app">10. Tides App</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/tides-app.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968079" /><br/>
The new Tides app lets you check the condition of over 115,000 beaches all over the world for the next seven days. Slide your finger along the tide gauge to flow forward into the future. You can check rising, falling, high, and low tides, as well as weather, wind speed and direction, sunrise, sunset, swell height, and intervals between swells. There's an option to open the tide location in Maps and Weather, as well as a Tides widget that you can add to the Smart Stack.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="11._exit_sleep_mode_faster">11. Exit Sleep Mode Faster</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/sleep-mode.jpg" alt="sleep" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968080" /><br/>
In previous versions of watchOS, you had to long press the Digital Crown for around three seconds to exit sleep mode. This delay felt like an age in the middle of the night. Fortunately in watchOS 11, all you need to do is press the Digital Crown and your regular watch face will be displayed immediately. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="12._add_missing_workout_minutes">12. Add Missing Workout Minutes</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/resume-workout.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968081" /><br/>
If you pause a workout and then continue working out but forget to resume on your watch, the Workout app will now ask you if you want to resume – and will even offer to add on the minutes that you missed. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="13._custom_pool_swim_workouts">13. Custom Pool Swim Workouts</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/pool-swim-custom.jpg" alt="workout" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968089" /><br/>
watchOS 11 includes new custom workouts for Pool swims. So now you can customize 100 yard individual medley, 800 meter freestyle, 1200 yard pyramid, 800 yard swim and kick, 800 yard time cycles, and 1200 yard speed work. Your Apple Watch will then guide you through timed intervals of work and recovery in the pool, with haptics to let you know when it’s time to move to the next interval.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, a new Up Next workout view for all types of Custom Workouts can show what remains in the current interval and provide a snapshot of the upcoming interval. Thanks to enhancements in GPS positioning, the Workout app also offers even more workout types that can track distance. These include Soccer, American Football, Australian Football, Outdoor Hockey, Lacrosse, Downhill Skiing, Cross Country Skiing, Snowboarding, Golf, Outdoor Rowing, and more. You will also see your route maps for more workouts than before.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="14._change_activity_goals">14. Change Activity Goals</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/schedule-activity-goals.jpg" alt="activity" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968091" /><br/>
The Activity app for Apple Watch now lets you schedule custom activity goals for different days of the week. If you tap the +/- button when viewing your Move, Exercise, or Stand goals in the app, a new Change Goals option lets you schedule goals for individual days of the week, or just for today.<br/>
<br/>
This means you can, for example, set custom workout goals from Monday to Friday, with lower goals during the weekend. This schedule can also be managed through the Fitness app in iOS 18. The Move, Exercise, and Stand activity summaries include the same +/- button that lets you adjust the goal for just today, or adjust your schedule for each day of the week.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="15._pin_timers">15. Pin Timers</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/pin-timers.jpg" alt="timers" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968092" /><br/>
The Timers app now lets you pin timers that you use regularly to the top of the app interface. Simply scroll down to the bottom of the timers, tap Edit, and then tap the pin icon on any timer to pin it to the top.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="16._new_double_tap_actions">16. New Double Tap Actions</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-double-tap-gesture-230912-Faeture-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915440" /><br/>
The Double Tap feature can now be used to scroll through navigable content in any Apple app, including the Weather and Messages. You can even use a double tap to dismiss a timer that has ended. Apple has also opened up Double Tap to developers with a new API, so expect to see third-party support coming soon. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="17._customize_fitness_summary">17. Customize Fitness Summary</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/activity-app.jpg" alt="activity" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968094" /><br/>
In the Fitness app on iOS 18, if you tap and hold any card (excluding Activity Rings) in the redesigned Summary view, an Edit option will appear. Tap that, and jiggle mode will be enabled. This allows you to choose from a selection of available sizes and data presentation types for the tapped card – similar to how widgets work on the Home Screen.<br/>
<br/>
You can also arrange the cards under Activity Rings in the way that best suits you, as well as add cards using the Add button. The same customization screen can be accessed via the Edit Summary option at the bottom of the interface, where you will also find a See All Categories option to directly access the data you want.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="18._new_widgets">18. New Widgets</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/smart-stack-widgets.jpg" alt="widgets" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968095" /><br/>
watchOS 11 brings several new intelligent widgets to the Smart Stack, including Vitals, Tides, Music Recognition, Check In, Translate, and Photos.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="19._vitals">19. Vitals</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/vitals-watch-app.jpg" alt="vitals" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968097" /><br/>
Apple has enhanced the sleep tracking capabilities of Apple Watch with the introduction of the Vitals app. The app displays crucial overnight health data including heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature, blood oxygen levels (where available), and sleep duration. One of the app's key features is its ability to establish personalized typical ranges for each health metric collected during sleep, allowing you to quickly assess how your current metrics compare to your usual patterns.<br/>
<br/>
The app sends notifications if multiple metrics fall outside your typical range. These alerts are accompanied by contextual information, highlighting potential factors that might influence these readings, such as medications, changes in elevation, alcohol consumption, or illness.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="20._translate_phrases">20. Translate Phrases</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-watch-translate.jpg" alt="translate" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968098" /><br/>
Thanks to the Translate app in watchOS 11, you can now see a translation on your wrist by typing or dictating a phrase. You can play the translation out loud and even slow it down. And you can use the Translate app on your watch without your iPhone when you have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection, or by downloading a language for offline use. According to Apple, the Translate widget will also automatically surface in your Smart Stack if you're traveling in a location where a different language is spoken.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="21._redesigned_now_playing_view">21. Redesigned Now Playing View</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/now-playing-watch.jpg" alt="now playing" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968099" /><br/>
In previous versions of watchOS, the Now Playing View would take up the whole screen, preventing you from quickly checking your watch face. In watchOS 11, it's been moved to the top of the Smart Stack, which is accessed with a scroll of the Digital Crown, keeping the time and your complications front and center. To revert to the fullscreen media playback controls, simply tap the widget.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="22._play_audio_through_apple_watch_speaker">22. Play Audio Through Apple Watch Speaker</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/play-music-apple-watch-speakers.jpg" alt="now playing" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968100" /><br/>
If you have an Apple Watch Series 10 or an Apple Watch Ultra 2, you can now choose your watch's speakers through which to play audio. If you have music or podcasts downloaded to your watch, even if you don't have AirPods or your iPhone, you can still listen to them from your wrist. To switch playback from iPhone to Apple Watch, in the audio output menu (accessed via the top-right icon in the Now Playing screen), simply tap Control Other Speakers & TVs, then tap Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="23._new_modular_ultra_bezel">23. New Modular Ultra Bezel</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/modular-ultra-training-load.jpg" alt="modular ultra" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968101" /><br/>
The Modular Ultra watch face has picked up a new bezel option that displays your training load and vitals readings. Vitals must collect data for seven sleeps before displaying anything (you need sleep mode on for it to collect the full set of data). Training load is based on the effort of your workouts over the last four weeks.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="24._change_alert_tones">24. Change Alert Tones</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/custom-tones.jpg" alt="settings" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968102" /><br/>
In Settings ➝ Sounds & Haptics, you'll notice new options to choose the Ringtone and Text Tone that your Apple Watch emits, as well as the ability to customize individual alerts for new Mail, Calendar, Reminders, and Default.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="25._live_activities_in_smart_stack">25. Live Activities in Smart Stack</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/live-activity-watch.jpg" alt="live activity" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968105" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1fmtqi6/smart_stacklive_activities/">Wongdraryl</a></em></div><br/>
Last but not least, watchOS 11 brings Live Activities support to Apple Watch. So if you have an ongoing Live Activity on your iPhone, it will also conveniently appear at the top of your Smart Stack, allowing you to keep tabs on how the activity is progressing right from your wrist.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/25-new-features-apple-watchos-11/">25 New Features You May Have Missed in watchOS 11</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/25-new-features-you-may-have-missed-in-watchos-11.2438116/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon this week has introduced the first notable discounts on the Apple Watch Series 10, taking <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHYQ1VJ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">&#36;30 off two models</a>. We're also tracking even <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ3PBKT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">steeper discounts on the Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> on Amazon right now.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Series 10</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-lineup-240909-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964982" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
Starting with the 42mm GPS Apple Watch Series 10 in Rose Gold Aluminum, you can get this model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHYQ1VJ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;369.00</strong></a> in S/M, down from &#36;399.00. Additionally, the 46mm GPS model in Jet Black Aluminum is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHQ2QH6%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;399.00</strong></a> in M/L, down from &#36;429.00.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHYQ1VJ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;30 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm GPS) for &#36;369.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
We've seen a few &#36;10 discounts on the Apple Watch Series 10, some of which are still available on Amazon today, but this is the first time we're tracking a bigger markdown on the brand new wearable. No other major online retailer has a discount on the Series 10 this week, and Amazon provides an estimated delivery between September 27 and 30.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Ultra 2</h2><br/>

<br/>
Secondly, Amazon has further discounted the Apple Watch Ultra 2 in Black this week. You can get a few models of the Black Titanium watch for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ3PBKT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;734.89</strong></a>, down from &#36;799.00.

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ3PBKT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;64 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 (Black) for &#36;734.89</div></a></div><br/>

		<title>Apple Exploring Lower Resolution Displays for Cheaper Vision Headset</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly investigating the use of lower-resolution displays for a budget-friendly version of its Vision Pro spatial computing headset, according to recent reports from <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240924PD210/apple-affordable-mr-sdc-jdi.html">DigiTimes</a></em> and other industry sources.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-lenses.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898584" /><br/>
Apple has received OLED display samples from Japan Display (JDI) with a pixel density of around 1,500 pixels per inch (PPI), claims <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4967">The Elec</a></em>. This is significantly lower than the 3,391 PPI displays used in the current Vision Pro, which launched earlier this year starting from &#36;3,500.<br/>
<br/>
By reducing the pixel density, Apple could substantially cut down on manufacturing costs while still offering a high-quality visual experience. Indeed, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/lower-resolution-displays-for-cheaper-headset/">reports as far back as June</a> indicate that Apple has been sending requests for information (RFIs) to various display manufacturers, including Samsung Display and LG Display. These RFIs have reportedly asked for OLED displays with pixel densities around 1,700 PPI, suggesting Apple is exploring multiple options for its cheaper headset.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, the sample provided by JDI is said to use glass core substrate (GCS) OLED technology, rather than the OLED-on-Silicon (OLEDoS) displays currently used in the Vision Pro. This shift in display technology could further contribute to a cost reduction. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman in June claimed that a cheaper Vision Pro could require a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/cheaper-apple-vision-pro-tethered-iphone-mac/">tethered iPhone or Mac to operate</a>, which would allow Apple to save money on processing power and components needed to make it a standalone device. Gurman also claimed that an existing prototype lower-cost headset, codenamed N107, has a narrower field of view compared to Vision Pro. Apple could even potentially eliminate the EyeSight feature and use lighter weight build materials. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless, the development of the device apparently remains at an early stage – <em>DigiTimes</em> suggests it could take two to three years before it enters mass production. That's a lot later than previous predictions that we could see a late 2025 launch. In the meantime, competition among display manufacturers to secure Apple's orders is expected to intensify, with companies from South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan all vying for a piece of the potentially lucrative contract.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/25/apple-lower-resolution-display-cheaper-headset/">Apple Exploring Lower Resolution Displays for Cheaper Vision Headset</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-exploring-lower-resolution-displays-for-cheaper-vision-headset.2438086/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iOS 18 brings a significant redesign to the Photos app, introducing a unified Library View that consolidates all sections into a single, scrollable interface. While this new layout <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-navigating-redesigned-photos-app/">aims to streamline navigation</a>, you may want to tailor it to your preferences. Here's how you can customize and reorder collections in the new Photos app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-photos-app-collections.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961380" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Understanding Collections in Photos</h2><br/>
In iOS 18, everything outside the main photo grid in the Photos app is considered a "Collection." These include:<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Recent Days</strong>: Chronological view of your latest photos, similar to the previous iOS 17 Days view. Tap to see your entire library sorted by date.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Albums</strong>: Access all your created albums, including those shared with others.</li><br/>
<li><strong>People and Pets</strong>: AI-organized albums of individuals and animals. New Group feature automatically clusters frequent companions, with manual creation option.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Memories</strong>: Auto-generated slideshows, now featuring Apple Intelligence Memory Maker for enhanced presentations.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Trips</strong>: Location-based photo collections. View your travels organized by year.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Shared Albums</strong>: Collaborative photo collections shared between users.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Pinned Collections</strong>: Quick access to your most important albums or collections.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Featured Photos</strong>: AI-curated showcase of your best shots, updated regularly.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Media Types</strong>: Filter photos by capture mode (e.g., Live Photos, Portrait, Panoramas) or file type (e.g., Screenshots, Screen Recordings).</li><br/>
<li><strong>Utilities</strong>: Smart filters for practical image types like handwritten notes or receipts.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Wallpaper Suggestions</strong>: AI-selected images optimized for device wallpapers, with customizable visual elements.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Each collection offers different ways to view and organize your photos, from auto-generated slideshows to filters for specific types of images.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-collections.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961386" /><br/>
<h2>How to Customize and Reorder Collections</h2><br/>
You can easily change the order of collections and choose which ones to display. By customizing your collections, you can prioritize the features you use most often, making your photo browsing experience more tailored to your needs. To do so, simply follow these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Open the Photos app.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the main view.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>Customize and Reorder</strong> option.</li><br/>
<li>In the customization menu, you can deselect the checkmark next to a collection to remove it from view, and tap and hold the three bars next to a collection, then drag to rearrange its position.</li><br/>
<li>Once you're satisfied with your changes, tap the "<strong>X</strong>" in the top right corner to exit and return to the main Photos view.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-collections-reorder.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961387" /><br/>
<br/>
Remember, you can always return to this menu to make further adjustments as your preferences change. As you explore the redesigned Photos app, take some time to experiment with different collection arrangements. You might discover new ways to interact with your photo library that enhance the overall experience.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-customize-reorder-photos-app/">iOS 18: How to Customize and Reorder the Photos App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-how-to-customize-and-reorder-the-photos-app.2438082/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Card Savings Account Receives Another Interest Rate Cut</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>'s high-yield savings account received an interest rate cut overnight, the second time it has done so this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-card-savings-account-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928948" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; savings account's annual percentage yield (APY) dropped from 4.4% to 4.25%, in line with the US Federal Reserve approving an aggressive rate cut of 50 basis points last week. Push notifications regarding the cut were sent to &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users on Tuesday evening.<br/>
<br/>
When the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;'s savings account first became available, it offered an APY of 4.15%. The rate then increased three times, first to 4.25%, then to 4.35%, and finally to 4.5%, before being lowered to 4.4% in April 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced its savings account in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">April 2023</a>, partnering with Goldman Sachs. Designed for &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; holders, the account is exclusively available to U.S. residents aged 18 and above. It can be managed through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s Wallet app, offering a user-friendly experience with no fees, minimum deposits, or balance requirements.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows users to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, as well as on funds transferred from linked bank accounts or Apple Cash balances. Initially capped at &#36;250,000, the maximum balance has since been increased to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/">&#36;1,000,000</a>, providing more flexibility for high-value savers.<br/>
<br/>
Opening an account is straightforward. Users simply need to access their &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; in the Wallet app, tap the three-dot menu at the top of the screen, select Daily Cash, and then choose the option to set up savings. This process integrates seamlessly with the existing &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; interface.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that Goldman Sachs has reportedly indicated plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">end its consumer lending partnership with Apple</a>. However, the potential impact of this change on &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; holders remains uncertain at this time.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/25/apple-card-savings-account-interest-rate-cut/">Apple Card Savings Account Receives Another Interest Rate Cut</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-account-receives-another-interest-rate-cut.2438078/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Writing Tools is one of the main Apple Intelligence features that's available in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 betas for developers and public beta testers. As the name suggests, Writing Tools are meant to help you write.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963424" /><br/>
This guide goes over everything you can do with Writing Tools, where you can use them, and what you need to access the feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="writing_tools_overview">Writing Tools Overview</h2><br/>
There are various AI tools that will write content for you, but that's not how Apple designed Writing Tools and that's not what it's meant to do. The feature can be used to improve, tweak, and refine what you've written, but you still need to write something for it to work with first.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-writing-tools.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960221" /><br/>
Apple doesn't have a feature for generating text, but that will probably be something iOS and macOS will be capable of when ChatGPT integration is introduced later this year.<br/>
<br/>
You can use Writing Tools to check your spelling, grammar, and word choice, or to change the tone of what you've written. There's also an option to summarize text.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="how_to_use_writing_tools">How to Use Writing Tools</h2><br/>
To use Writing Tools in an app like Notes or Pages, you can simply select text and then either tap or right click to get to the Writing Tools option, depending on which OS you're using. Apps like Notes have a Writing Tools interface built-in, so you can also get to Writing Tools from the in-app toolbar.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, getting to Writing Tools is as simple as selecting text to get to the different options you can use. From the Writing Tools interface, you can access the available options for proofreading, rewriting, and summarizing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="proofread">Proofread</h2><br/>
When it comes to proofreading, Writing Tools does more than just check spelling. It also looks at word choice and grammar. If you use the wrong version of they're/their/there, effect/affect, or two/to/too, Writing Tools will correct it. Spelling issues are pointed out, of course, and Writing Tools can fix some grammar issues.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/writing-tools-proofread.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968047" /><br/>
It doesn't always tell you if you're misusing semicolons, colons, or ellipses, but it will add in a period if you miss one, fix quotes, or add in commas where they're needed.<br/>
<br/>
Writing Tools is also able to fix shorthand and swap out poor phrasing. So if you write "luv" instead of "love," your Apple device can fix it. "Write real good" becomes "write really well."<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, Writing Tools does not go through issues one by one with you for making changes on an error-by-error basis. What it does is spit out a rewritten version of what you've asked it to proofread, and you can choose to copy that text, replace your text with it, or share it. It's an all-or-nothing correction, and it can be hard to spot every change if you're correcting a lot of text.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="rewrite">Rewrite</h2><br/>
The Writing Tools Rewrite feature refines what you've written, and it can be used to change the tone of your writing. If you just select some text and choose the base Rewrite option, Writing Tools spits out a version of your text that's more refined and fleshed out, but there are also Friendly, Professional, and Concise styles to choose from. Here's an example of each.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/writing-tools-rewrite.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968048" /><br/>
<strong>Original Text:</strong><br/>
<blockquote>There are AI tools that will write content for you on the internet, but that's not what Apple designed Writing Tools for. You're going to love the Writing Tools feature because it is able to help you write really well. Writing Tools helps you with your spelling, but it also has a positive effect on your grammar. There are multiple Writing Tools to use such as proofreading, rewriting, and summarizing.</blockquote><br/>
<strong>Standard Rewrite:</strong><br/>
<blockquote>There are AI tools available online that can generate content for you, but that's not the purpose of Apple's Writing Tools. You'll be delighted with the Writing Tools feature because it genuinely assists you in writing effectively. Writing Tools not only helps you with spelling but also positively impacts your grammar. It offers various tools, including proofreading, rewriting, and summarizing, to cater to your writing needs.</blockquote><br/>

<blockquote>There are AI tools available online that can generate content, but this is not the intended purpose of Apple's Writing Tools. The Writing Tools feature is designed to enhance your writing skills and is particularly useful for improving your spelling and grammar. It offers a range of tools, including proofreading, rewriting, and summarization, to assist you in crafting well-written content.</blockquote><br/>
<strong>Friendly Rewrite:</strong><br/>
<blockquote>Have you heard about AI tools that can write content for you online? Well, that's not what Apple designed Writing Tools for. You're going to love this feature because it's designed to help you write really well. Writing Tools helps you with your spelling, but it also has a positive impact on your grammar. There are different Writing Tools to use, like proofreading, rewriting, and summarizing.</blockquote><br/>
<strong>Concise Rewrite:</strong><br/>
<blockquote>AI tools can generate content online, but Apple designed Writing Tools for something else: excellent writing. Writing Tools aids with spelling and grammar, offering proofreading, rewriting, and summarizing options.</blockquote><br/>
Looking at various rewriting samples, the standard Rewrite option seems to be a mix of all three styles. It's not as business-like as the professional option, nor as casual as the friendly option.<br/>
<h2 id="summary_options">Summary Options</h2><br/>
You can select text and use the Writing Tools summary options to automatically get the gist of a longer piece of text, and it's something that can be particularly useful for long web articles, PDFs, or even your own notes if they're lengthy.<br/>
<br/>
Options for summarizing text include Summary, Key Points, List, and Table. Using the text from the prior examples, here's what each one looks like.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
<blockquote>Apple's Writing Tools feature enhances writing by correcting spelling and grammar, and offering proofreading, rewriting, and summarizing assistance.</blockquote><br/>
<strong>Key Points:</strong><br/>
<blockquote><strong>Writing Tools Purpose:</strong> To help users write well, not to replace human writing.<br/>
<strong>Writing Tools Features:</strong> Spelling and grammar checking, proofreading, rewriting, and summarizing.<br/>
<strong>Writing Tools Benefits:</strong> Improves writing quality.</blockquote><br/>
<strong>List:</strong><br/>
<blockquote>Apple designed Writing Tools to assist with writing, not to generate content.<br/>
Writing Tools helps with spelling and grammar.<br/>
There are multiple Writing Tools available, including proofreading, rewriting, and summarizing.</blockquote><br/>

<h2 id="writing_tools_availability">Writing Tools Availability</h2><br/>
You can use Writing Tools anywhere there's text on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac that's capable of Apple Intelligence. It is system wide. Just select the text and bring up the tap or right click menu and then choose the Writing Tools option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-writing-tools-rewrite.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960713" /><br/>
Writing Tools works with your own writing so you can refine your text in Notes, Pages, Messages, and anywhere else you write text, but it also works in Safari, the Books app, and in PDFs. You can use it in third-party apps, too.<br/>
<br/>
Note that like all Apple Intelligence features, Writing Tools is in beta right now, and it's not perfect. It seems to work more reliably on iOS and iPadOS than macOS at the current time, but that's not unusual for a beta.<br/>
<br/>
Even when Apple Intelligence launches, it's still going to be launching as a beta, and it's likely it will stay in beta status for quite some time as Apple works out the kinks.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="writing_tools_requirements">Writing Tools Requirements</h2><br/>
To use Writing Tools, you need a device capable of Apple Intelligence. That includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max, any <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> model, any &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with an M-series chip, and any Mac with an M-series chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features do not work on any other devices because of the processing power and memory required.<br/>
<br/>
Writing Tools is in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 betas at the current time. The betas are available to developers and public beta testers, and the updates are going to come out sometime in October.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="how_useful_are_writing_tools">How Useful Are Writing Tools?</h2><br/>
For the most part, Writing Tools can be a useful tool for checking spelling and grammar, because it goes a lot further than your standard spell check. It would be more useful if there was an option to go through suggestions one-by-one and reject changes rather than being forced to accept an all-in-one refinement, but maybe that's a change Apple will make later.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing each change individually would make for a better learning tool, providing insight into what specific changes were made and why.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's summaries can also be overly brief, failing to include some key details. Unless summaries get more detailed, it's hard to see how they can be a truly useful tool. Key points and lists do a bit better than a general summary, but there's still work that needs to be done to refine the experience.<br/>
<br/>
Rewriting will likely be useful for some, but it does have something of an AI feel to the text that you get when you use it. It's not a tool that you should rely on without making further edits to make sure that the changes are what you really want to say. Rewrite does do an excellent job of matching the stated tone, and it would be nice to see additional tone options in the future.<br/>

		<title>Apple&#039;s 80% Charging Limit for iPhone: How Much Did It Help After a Year?</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models that came out last year, Apple added an opt-in battery setting that limits maximum charge to 80 percent. The idea is that never charging the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> above 80 percent will increase battery longevity, so I kept my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at that 80 percent limit from September 2023 to now, with no cheating.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
My &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max battery level is currently at 94 percent with 299 cycles. For a lot of 2024, my battery level stayed above 97 percent, but it started dropping more rapidly over the last couple of months.<br/>
<br/>
I left my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at that 80 percent limit and at no point turned the setting off or tweaked it. There were some days when I ran out of battery because I was without a charger for most of the day, and there were other times that I had to bring a battery along to make sure I didn't run out of power. It wasn't always convenient to keep it at 80 percent, but there were days when it didn't have too much of an impact.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-15-pro-max-battery-test.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968044" /><br/>
It was always a treat when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; randomly decided to charge to 100 percent, which is something Apple has baked in to the 80 percent limit to ensure the battery level stays calibrated.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, I charged using USB-C rather than <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a>, but there was some &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging mixed in. There was probably a 70/30 split between wired charging and &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging. I did often let my battery get quite low before charging, and it didn't sit on the charger for long periods of time too often. Most charging was done in a room at 72 degrees. I'm adding this context because temperature is a factor that can affect battery longevity, and wireless charging is warmer than wired charging.<br/>
<br/>
You can compare your level battery to mine, but here are a couple other metrics from MacRumors staff that also have an &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max and did not have the battery level limited.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Current capacity: 87%. Cycles: 329</li><br/>
 	<li>Current capacity: 90%. Cycles: 271</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
I don't have a lot of data points for comparison, but it does seem that limiting the charge to 80 percent kept my maximum battery capacity higher than what my co-workers are seeing, but there isn't a major difference. I have four percent more battery at 28 more cycles, and I'm not sure suffering through an 80 percent battery limit for 12 months was ultimately worth it.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible that the real gains from an 80 percent limit will come in two or three years rather than a single year, and I'll keep it limited to 80 percent to see the longer term impact.<br/>
<br/>
I did set my <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max to an 80 percent limit, but I don't know if I want to continue the test given the lackluster results I had from 2023 to 2024. Will the thermal changes in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models make any difference? Maybe, maybe not. There's a 90 percent charge limit option too, and that might be more feasible than 80 percent for most people, especially those that have phones with smaller batteries.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been more than two and a half years since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-discontinues-27-inch-imac/">discontinued the 27-inch iMac</a>, as part of its move away from Intel processors. Since then, the 24-inch iMac has been Apple's only all-in-one desktop computer, with no larger model available.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
Will a larger iMac ever make a comeback? We recap the latest rumors below.<br/>
 <br/>
In November, Apple announced that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">no plans to release a new version of the 27-inch iMac</a> with an Apple silicon chip. Instead, Apple recommended pairing its standalone Studio Display with its Mac Studio or Mac mini desktop computers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's statement ruled out a new 27-inch iMac, but an even larger model is still possible one day. Nearly a year ago, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">both <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said Apple was developing a 32-inch iMac for release in late 2024 or in 2025. Kuo said the larger iMac's screen would feature mini-LED backlighting, which would allow for increased brightness, higher contrast ratio, and other benefits compared to LCD technology.<br/>
<br/>
While there haven't been any rumors lately about this alleged 32-inch iMac, Gurman said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-still-working-on-larger-imac/">still exploring a larger iMac</a> as recently as August.<br/>
<br/>
"A larger iMac remains something Apple is exploring as well, but it's unclear if that will be an M4 product or something that comes the following year or later," he wrote.<br/>
<br/>
That is all that is known about a potential larger iMac at this point.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it seems that a larger iMac might be on Apple's roadmap, but the wait continues for now.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, the 24-inch iMac is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/15/m4-macs-and-new-ipads-at-next-apple-event/">updated with the M4 chip in October</a>, alongside new MacBook Pro and Mac mini models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/will-apple-bring-back-a-larger-imac/">Will Apple Bring Back a Larger iMac?

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest iPhone 16 models include a new Camera Control button (located on the lower right-hand side when holding the phone in portrait mode). The new button aims to make it easier to adjust photography settings when shooting with the iPhone in both portrait and landscape orientation.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fEm-JQrkIOE" title="iPhone 16 Camera Control: Every Feature You NEED to Know!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
A simple press of the Camera Control button brings up the Camera app when the iPhone is unlocked. Once the Camera app is open, another press takes a picture, while pressing and holding the button records video for as long as you hold it down.<br/>
<br/>
Within the Camera app, a light press on the button engages a haptic click that also allows for adjusting things like manual exposure and zoom, thanks to a handy sliding interface that operates similarly to a camera dial. This gesture also reveals a clean preview of the scene you're capturing by hiding all on-screen Camera app tools. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/camera-control-menu.jpg" alt="camera" width="3381" height="1902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967316" /><br/>
You can also use the button as a touch interface on the menu the Camera Control button brings up: A light double press invokes a range of photographic adjustment tools in a subtle UI. You can swipe through this menu and select individual options with a further light press. You can also choose between multiple styles and adjust the tone. All of these tools are adjustable with a swipe, while a double light press returns you to the main Camera Control menu:<br/>
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;"><br/>
  <ul><br/>
    <li>Exposure</li><br/>
    <li>Depth</li><br/>
    <li>Zoom</li><br/>
  </ul><br/>
</div><br/>
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;"><br/>
  <ul><br/>
    <li>Cameras</li><br/>
    <li>Styles</li><br/>
    <li>Tone</li><br/>
  </ul><br/>
</div><br/>
<div style="clear: both;"></div><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-capture-button.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964713" /><br/>
The Camera Control button can also be used to trigger third-party camera apps, giving more flexibility to users who prefer other photography tools. It's also integrated with Visual Intelligence (an aspect of forthcoming Apple Intelligence), allowing users to pull up contextual information about objects or scenes in front of the camera. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Adjusting Camera Control Pressure</h2><br/>
If you're having trouble engaging the light-press functions, or you find that the button is a little too sensitive for you, you can adjust the level of pressure that it responds to. If you feel that it's overly sensitive, you can make it firmer; if it's not sensitive enough, you can make it respond to lighter presses. The following steps show you how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Under "Physical & Motor," tap <strong>Camera Control</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Switch from the <strong>Default</strong> setting to the <strong>Lighter</strong> or <strong>Firmer</strong> options.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/adjust-camera-control-pressure-sensitivity-iphone-16.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967244" /><br/>
<br/>
If you stay on this menu screen, you can try out the different pressure levels of the Camera Control button without engaging the Camera app, so make sure you give all three options a try before settling on one.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Disable Clean Preview</h2><br/>
By default, using the Camera Control button in the Camera app engages Clean Preview mode. This option hides everything in the Camera UI when the Camera Control button is lightly pressed, so you don't need to worry about accidentally touching camera lens adjustments while shooting. Another advantage is that it removes all distractions from the screen, leaving only the image — perfect for composing a shot.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/clean-preview-example-camera-control.jpg" alt="camera" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967256" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Clean Preview enabled (left) vs. Clean Preview disabled</em></div><br/>
What if you do want to have access to all the various Camera app adjustments while also using Camera Control? Fortunately, there's an easy way to disable Clean Preview and make the other Camera tools visible. The following steps show you how it's done.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>On your iPhone, open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Camera</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Camera Control</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Toggle off the switch next to <strong>Clean Preview</strong>.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/disable-clean-preview-camera-control-iphone-16.jpg" alt="settings" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967259" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. To reinstate Camera app features that are hidden by a light press on the Camera Control button, simply toggle back on the <strong>Clean Preview</strong> option in <strong>Settings ➝ Camera ➝ Camera Control</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Disable Light Press Adjustments</h2><br/>
If you find yourself accidentally engaging the Camera Control adjustments when taking a picture in high-motion environments (like inadvertently zooming in or changing exposure settings), you can remove light press functionality from the Camera Control button entirely. Here's how it's done:<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Under "Physical & Motor," tap <strong>Camera Control</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Toggle off the switch next to <strong>Show Adjustments</strong>.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/disable-camera-control-light-press-adjustments-iphone-16.jpg" alt="settings" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967234" /><br/>
<br/>
This option removes the Camera Control interface and its corresponding light-press adjustments, so now you don't need to worry about accidentally engaging them while shooting. This essentially makes the Camera Control button a simple shutter button after you have opened the Camera app with the first press.<br/>
<br/>
To reinstate Camera Control adjustments that are activated by a light press, simply toggle back on the <strong>Show Adjustments</strong> option in <strong>Settings -> Accessibility -> Camera Control</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Change Camera Control Launch Camera Gesture</h2><br/>
If you find yourself accidentally opening the Camera app by unintentionally pressing the Camera Control button, you can either disable the button entirely (see below), or you can change the single-click gesture that invokes the Camera app to a double-click gesture. The following steps show you how to do the latter:<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>On your iPhone, open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Camera</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Camera Control</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Under "Launch Camera," tap <strong>Double Click</strong>.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/change-gesture-to-open-camera-app-iphone-16.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967267" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. A single click of the Camera Control button will now do nothing, while a double click will get you into the Camera app or any other third-party camera app that you have assigned to the button.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Changing Camera Control Functionality</h2><br/>
While the new button aims to make it easier to adjust photography settings when shooting, if you want, you can make it work as a simple QR code scanner or a Magnifier. <br/>
<br/>
For people whose job involves frequently interact with QR codes, this Camera Control feature could be a game-changer. In warehouse environments, for example, employees could quickly scan inventory tags without navigating through multiple app screens, significantly speeding up stock checks and order processing. The neat thing is that the Camera Control button retains its zoom function in the app, and it also allows for one-handed operation.<br/>

As for Magnifier access, Camera Control could prove invaluable in various scenarios. For people with visual impairments, the feature allows for instant magnification of small text on menus, product labels, or medication instructions without them having to fumble through apps. <br/>
<br/>
Camera Control also retains its zoom adjustment function in the Magnifier tool, and adds a menu that includes Magnifier options for brightness, contrast, filters, torch, and more if you add them via the Magnifier's settings menu.<br/>
<br/>
Here's how to re-assign the Camera Control button for QR code scanning or magnifying:<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>On your iPhone, open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Camera</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Camera Control</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Select <strong>Code Scanner</strong> or <strong>Magnifier</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/use-camera-control-code-scanner-magnifier.jpg" alt="settings" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967304" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. Now when you click Camera Control, depending on your preference the QR code scanner app or the Magnifier app will be instantly invoked. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Disable Camera Control</h2><br/>
If you find yourself accidentally opening the Camera app by unintentionally pressing the Camera Control button, or if you just don't find yourself using it for whatever reason, you can turn off the button's functionality completely. The following steps show you how it's done.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Under "Physical & Motor," tap <strong>Camera Control</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Toggle off the switch next to <strong>Camera Control</strong>.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/disable-camera-control-iphone-16.jpg" alt="settings" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967240" /><br/>
<br/>
Having done that, the Camera Control button will no longer engage the Camera app and its corresponding functionality, so you no longer have to worry about pressing it – it won't do anything.<br/>
<br/>
To reinstate Camera Control features, simply toggle back on the "Camera Control" switch in <strong>Settings ➝ Accessibility ➝ Camera Control</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't quite get on with Camera Control, don't give up on it completely. It can take a while to get used to. It's also worth noting that the button will soon get additional features: In a software update coming later this year, Camera Control will introduce a two-stage shutter that lets you automatically lock focus and exposure with a light press — so you can re-frame your shot without losing focus on your subject.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/camera-control/">Camera Control</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-16-using-new-camera-control-button/">iPhone 16 Camera Control: Everything You Need to Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-camera-control-everything-you-need-to-know.2437219/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second public betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its October launch. The second beta comes a day after Apple provided the software to developers. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963902" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" /><br/>
Public beta testers who have <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">signed up for Apple's beta testing program</a> can download the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 updates by opening up the Settings app, tapping into the Software Update section and selecting the Public Beta option. Apple has also released watchOS 11.1 and tvOS 18.1 betas for public beta testers.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 are the first updates that includes Apple Intelligence features. Not all AI capabilities have been added, but the beta includes Writing Tools, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> updates, summaries, AI-powered Focus modes, and smart replies. To use Apple Intelligence features, you need an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> model, or M-series Mac or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Writing Tools are available whenever text can be selected and edited, and the feature can be used for spell checking, correcting grammar, rewriting your work with a new tone, and summarizing text.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has been overhauled with a new design that includes a subtle glow around the display, and Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; means you don't have to speak to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to get answers. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌ can follow along if you stumble over your words, and can maintain context between requests. Safari can summarize articles, and there's a new Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode that intelligently highlights only important notifications.<br/>
<br/>
Smart replies are available in Messages and Mail, plus the Mail app surfaces priority time sensitive messages and puts them at the top of your inbox. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> has a Memory Movie feature for creating slideshows based on text descriptions, and there is a Clean Up tool for unwanted objects in your photos.<br/>
<br/>
All iOS 18.1 users can now access phone call recording and transcribing, with recorded calls saved in the Notes app, but summarizing phone calls from those transcriptions is an Apple Intelligence feature. The update also brings spatial photo capabilities to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro and Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
The second beta includes an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/drag-and-drop-files-iphone-mirroring/">update to iPhone Mirroring</a>, adding support for drag and drop file transfers between the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the Mac. &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; users will see a Control Center reset option and a Camera Control icon to activate the front-facing camera for selfies.<br/>
<br/>
More on all of the features that are available in the betas right now can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">found in our Apple Intelligence guide</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Monday seeded the second beta of HomePod software version 18.1 to developers for testing, but it has since pulled the beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/homepod-mini-thumb-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770560" /><br/>
Across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2-homepod-minis-bricked-with-os-18-1-beta-5.2437870/">MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Earth2075/status/1838336848051015944">X</a>, some users complained that installing this beta on their HomePod mini resulted in the speaker going into a "bricked" state, meaning that it no longer functioned. A few users said they were eventually able to restore the HomePod mini using the Apple Configurator app on a Mac. <br/>
<br/>
Apple pulled the beta on Monday evening, according to software researcher <a href="https://x.com/nicolas09F9/status/1838401383709442090">Nicolás Alvarez</a>. <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a> confirmed that the beta is still unavailable as of writing, and it is unclear when it will be released again.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is facing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/17/apple-pulls-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro/">similar issue with iPadOS 18</a>, which "bricked" some of the latest iPad Pro models with the M4 chip earlier this month.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Music Classical, the classical music streaming service <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-music-classical-now-available/">introduced in early 2023</a>, received a version 2.0 update today that brings a couple of worthwhile new features to the iPhone and iPad app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-music-classical-booklets.jpg" alt="" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967886" /><br/>
This latest version of the app adds album booklets for thousands of albums. Album booklets offer multi-language liner notes, composer biographies, information about the orchestra, conductors, and soloists, plus where relevant, sung texts and opera libretti, enriching listeners' understanding of the music.<br/>
<br/>
When a booklet is available for an album you've selected, you'll see an open book icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Tapping that will download the booklet, which can be viewed by using zoom gestures and scrolled to reveal more content. In addition to album booklets, version 2.0 also adds a new Recently Added section to the Library.<br/>
<br/>
The ‌Apple Music‌ Classical app offers ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers access to over five million classical music tracks, including new high-quality releases, in addition to hundreds of curated playlists, thousands of exclusive albums, and other features like composer bios and deep dives on key works.<br/>
<br/>
The app offers a simpler interface for interacting with classical music specifically. Unlike the vanilla ‌Apple Music‌ app, ‌Apple Music‌ Classical allows you to search by composer, work, conductor, catalog number, and more. You can get more detailed information from editorial notes and descriptions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple commissioned high-resolution digital portraits of famous composers like Ludwig van Beethoven, Frédéric Chopin, and Johann Sebastian Bach for the app, using color palettes and artistic references from the relevant classical period, with more unique artwork to be added over time. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music-classical/">Apple Music Classical</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/apple-music-classical-2-full-album-booklets/">Apple Music Classical 2.0 Adds Thousands of Full Album Booklets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-classical-2-0-adds-thousands-of-full-album-booklets.2437943/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a lighthearted walk-and-talk around New York City, <em>The Tonight Show</em>'s Jimmy Fallon caught up with Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday to chat about the new iPhone 16 and Cook's love for the iconic Fifth Avenue Apple Store. Fallon – wearing Apple Vision Pro – met Cook with mock disbelief while picking up his new iPhone, with Cook personally handing him the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/tim-cook-jimmy-fallon.jpg" alt="" width="3016" height="1694" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967878" /><br/>
As they strolled to Apple's Upper East Side store, Cook explained that he tries to visit the Fifth Avenue location during every major launch. Fallon joked about Cook's rockstar-like reception from fans, but Cook humbly attributed it to people's love for Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The two discussed Cook's 27-year journey at Apple, during which Cook admitted he never expected to become CEO. On the tech front, Cook expressed excitement about Apple Intelligence, which is set to begin rolling out next month. Cook talked up upcoming features like automatic email summarization and fun new creative tools such as Genmoji and Image Playground.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KDBvTQUW6Ds?si=EO4aPihq33_-DL0x" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The chat ended on a playful note, with Fallon showing off his "psychic" skills by guessing Cook's mustard preference on hot dogs, before gifting him some New York-themed swag — though not all of it made the cut for Cook's local look.

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple has introduced a new feature that allows you to continue playing audio from your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s speakers while recording video in the Camera app. Whether you're creating a music video or simply want background music for your recordings, this new option offers you greater creative control over your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; videos.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/shooting-video.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967872" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jxk?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Jan Kopřiva</a></em></div><br/>
Previously in iOS 17, starting a video recording would automatically pause any audio playback on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. However, &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; allows you to change this behavior, thanks to a new Camera setting.<br/>
<br/>
Here's how to enable audio playback during video recording in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;:<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open the Settings app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
  <li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Camera</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Record Sound</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Toggle on the <strong>Allow Audio Playback</strong> option.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/allow-audio-playback-camera-setting.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960959" /><br/>
<br/>
Once enabled, your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will no longer automatically pause audio when you start recording video in the Camera app. Bear in mind that when playing audio through your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s speaker while recording, the audio will be captured in mono. <br/>
<br/>
This new option provides more flexibility than the previous workaround of using QuickTake in Photo mode, which allowed for continued audio playback but at a lower video quality. With &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, however, you can now enjoy full Video mode quality while maintaining your desired audio playback.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/record-iphone-audio-playback-videos-ios/">iOS 18: Capture iPhone Audio Playback When Recording Video</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-capture-iphone-audio-playback-when-recording-video.2437936/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models feature a second-generation Ceramic Shield material, which Apple says is even tougher than the prior-generation Ceramic Shield. Device insurance provider Allstate Protection Plans today published the results of its annual device drop test, giving us insight into the durability of the new iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Allstate Protection Plans Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Breakability Drop Tests" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6pm8BJN4h9c" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Allstate tested the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max, which is Apple's largest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to date at 6.9 inches. It continues to have a glass front and back, and though Apple has introduced better Ceramic Shield material that's infused with ceramic for durability, it's still no match for a concrete sidewalk.<br/>
<br/>
Using a "DropBot" to simulate drops from a height of six feet, Allstate conducted several tests. In the front-down drop test, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max display shattered and there were visible scuffs along the titanium frame. This drop rendered the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max unusable, though haptic responses were still felt so it could be repaired.<br/>
<br/>
In the back-down drop test, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max's rear glass shattered after one drop and suffered damage to the camera housing. It did remain functional, including the camera, but it was not safe to handle with bare hands due to the broken glass.<br/>
<br/>
No smartphones that have glass have survived Allstate's DropBot, so it is not surprising to see the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max fail. Glass and hard surfaces do not mix, so it is a good idea to have a protection plan of some kind like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ or a protective case. Drop tests of all kinds are hard to use to determine durability in a real world situation, as the angle of the drop, the height, and the surface that an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is falling on are always going to vary.<br/>
<br/>
Allstate has stopped doing dunk tests because &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models now have such solid water resistance, and the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models continue to offer the same IP67 water resistance as prior models. Other YouTube videos have tested the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models with drops, hammering, scratches, and other damage for those interested.<br/>

&zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 16 Plus is &#36;179 for two years or &#36;8.99 per month, and for the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, it's &#36;199 or &#36;9.99. With &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+, an &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max display replacement costs &#36;29, and without, it's &#36;379. Cracked back glass replacement is &#36;29 with &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ and &#36;199 without, and if both the front and back are cracked, it's &#36;499 (&#36;58 with &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+).<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/iphone-16-drop-tests/">Despite New Ceramic Shield, iPhone 16 Models Still Vulnerable to Drops</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/despite-new-ceramic-shield-iphone-16-models-still-vulnerable-to-drops.2437896/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Sonos Execs Launched Ill-Received App Despite Employee Protests</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Back in May, Sonos launched a new version of its mobile app, and it's been wildly unpopular with Sonos customers because of ongoing bugs and the removal of several features. Today, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-23/how-sonos-botched-an-app-and-infuriated-its-customers"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> delved into what went wrong at Sonos ahead of when the app launched, and why it came out anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/sonos-redesigned-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947528" /><br/>
Sonos had to come out with a new app when it launched the Sonos Ace headphones because of "technical debt." The company basically spent time working on new features instead of updating outdated code written in obsolete languages, leading to infrastructure issues. Sonos put off addressing the underlying technical debt, but introducing the headphones required the Sonos app and the cloud setup behind it to be overhauled.<br/>
<br/>
At the time the app was in development, Sonos laid off some of its employees to cut costs and also did some internal restructuring that was "causing chaos" by separating people who had worked together for years. As the app's launch approached, employees protested "forcefully," even resorting to yelling and screaming, because it was clear the app wasn't ready to launch.<br/>
<br/>
Former Sonos employees told <em>Bloomberg</em> that Sonos was prioritizing promises to investors and attracting new customers rather than ensuring equipment owned by longtime Sonos customers continued to work. One employee said they were afraid to push back further on the app's launch because it could lead to them losing their job.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos' lead counsel Eddie Lazarus did an internal investigation into the app's development and told <em>Bloomberg</em> that the app <em>was</em> delayed, from early 2024 to May 2024, and that there had been no "yelling" or "screaming" in meetings. Sonos apparently had a list of what it considered "essential" bugs that needed to be fixed pre-launch, but it decided that less critical bugs could wait until the app was released. "Our list of essential bugs, obviously, was not comprehensive enough," Lazarus told <em>Bloomberg</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos expects to miss its annual revenue target by &#36;200 million after the app debacle. In August, it laid off some employees, and it told others that yearly bonuses and merit-based pay raises have been canceled.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos CEO Patrick Spence <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/sonos-app-update-apology/">apologized to Sonos customers</a> in July and committed to regular updates to address bugs and add missing features. The company considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/sonos-bring-back-old-app/">bringing back the old app</a> as it worked on the new version, but it turned out <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/20/sonos-not-rereleasing-old-app/">that wasn't possible</a> because of the updates made to the cloud servers.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/sonos-delays-product-launces-to-fix-app/">decided to delay</a> two upcoming product launches in 2024 to instead focus on improving the Sonos app, and the company has "pulled together the very best and most experienced engineers" that it has to work on the app until it is fixed.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/sonos-app-development-insight/">Sonos Execs Launched Ill-Received App Despite Employee Protests</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-execs-launched-ill-received-app-despite-employee-protests.2437891/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Amnesia App Offers Easy Way to Get Rid of Monthly Access Reminders for Screen Capture Apps</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple requires users to regularly reauthorize permissions for screen recording apps, a change that has not been popular with some Mac app users. During the beta testing process, these reminders came up weekly, but later in the beta, Apple changed those reminders to monthly.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/amnesia-app-bypass-access-reminders.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967812" /><br/>
If you're someone who prefers not to get these reminders for screen recording apps at all, you can <a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/amnesia">use the Amnesia app</a> for the Mac to get rid of them. The app basically changes the .plist file for the screen capture app access feature, and it's a pay what you want situation.<br/>
<br/>
Those comfortable with tweaking plists themselves using the Terminal app <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/8/10.html">can follow instructions</a> shared by Jeff Johnson, known for Stop The Madness. Both Amnesia and the command line version of the fix require disabling reminders on an app by app basis, but it's a little more straightforward to do with the Amnesia app.<br/>
<br/>
Note that Amnesia works on &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15, but there is not yet a version for &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1, so if you're running the beta, you'll need to wait for an update. The update is expected later today.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/amnesia-screen-capture-app-reminders/">Amnesia App Offers Easy Way to Get Rid of Monthly Access Reminders for Screen Capture Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amnesia-app-offers-easy-way-to-get-rid-of-monthly-access-reminders-for-screen-capture-apps.2437884/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube is raising the cost of its Premium plan in multiple countries around the world, with the new pricing surfacing over the weekend <em>(<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-premium-price-increases-sept-2024-3483892/">via Android Authority</a>)</em>. Prices are up in Europe, South America, and and some countries in Asia and the Middle East.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/General-YouTube-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-814336" /><br/>
Price hikes are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubepremium/comments/1flwhzj/youtube_premium_increases_in_over_10_countries/">being tracked over on Reddit</a>, and so far customers in the following countries are being warned about higher prices: Belgium, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest single plan price increase is in Norway, where prices are up 42 percent. YouTube Premium in Norway used to cost approximately &#36;11.33 per month, but now it is just over &#36;16. In Sweden, the family plan now costs &#36;27.38 per month, up from &#36;17.57. On average, single person plans have increased 18 percent, while family plans are up 43 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Many YouTube Premium customers affected by the price changes have said on Reddit that they plan to cancel given the significant increases to family plans.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube Premium pricing has not increased in the United States, Canada, or other countries. In the U.S., the standard plan is &#36;13.99 per month, and a family plan is &#36;22.99 per month.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/">YouTube</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/youtube-premium-price-hike/">YouTube Raises Premium Prices in Over 15 Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-raises-premium-prices-in-over-15-countries.2437880/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
