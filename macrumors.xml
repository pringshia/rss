		<description><![CDATA[Apple is rumored to be working on a smart home hub that has been nicknamed the "HomePad." The device is expected to have a square iPad-like screen that can be attached to a HomePod-like speaker base, or it can be mounted on a wall.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/HomePod-With-Screen-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994529" /><em>We know, it probably won't look like this</em></div><br/>
One question on the minds of Apple fans: will the HomePad be previewed at WWDC next week?<br/>
<br/>
In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter last weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/01/wwdc-2025-likely-smaller-scale/">no major new devices ready to ship</a>, so it appears that the HomePad will not be launching soon. However, Apple could still provide an early preview of the device at WWDC 2025, providing developers with ample time to prepare for its release.<br/>
<br/>
To be clear, there are no rumors indicating that Apple does plan to preview the HomePad next week, but surprises happen sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that in November 2024, Gurman reported that the first-generation HomePad <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/">would not have an App Store</a>, but Apple could still release a set of developer APIs for the device. WWDC 2025 would be a fitting moment to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has a long history of announcing all-new product categories many months in advance of those products launching. The original iPhone was announced in January 2007, ahead of a June 2007 release. The original Apple Watch was unveiled in September 2014, and it launched in April 2015. The original HomePod launched in February 2018, eight months after being introduced at WWDC 2017. There are many other examples.<br/>
<br/>
In March, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the HomePod with a screen would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/homepod-with-screen-after-wwdc-kuo/">enter mass production in the third quarter of 2025</a>. If that timeframe remains accurate, then a WWDC 2025 preview really could make sense.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the upcoming iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26 updates are all rumored to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">sleek new glass-like designs</a>, and that look will likely extend to the HomePad's software. Apple could show it all off at once.<br/>
<br/>
This is all speculation, of course, and we do not want to get anyone's hopes up. WWDC 2025 is generally not expected to have any hardware announcements, but perhaps the timing might just be right for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-sleek-peek/">"sleek peek"</a> at the HomePad.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's smart home hub is rumored to feature a 6-inch or 7-inch display, and an A18 chip. It would allow users to control smart home accessories, make FaceTime video calls, use Apple's intercom feature between rooms in a house, and more. It might even double as a home security system <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/">with an Apple-designed camera</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the HomePad is shown off at WWDC, it might not ship for many months, as Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delayed the personalized Siri features</a> that are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-smart-home-hub-postponed/">expected to be core to the device</a>. We might have to wait for those features to be ready before getting our hands on the home hub. A release by some point next year seems likely at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/">keynote</a> begins on Monday at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/homepad-preview-at-wwdc-2025-or-not/">Will Apple Preview Its Rumored &#039;HomePad&#039; at WWDC Next Week?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-apple-preview-its-rumored-homepad-at-wwdc-next-week.2458186/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Live Photos, introduced in 2015, are photos that capture 1.5 seconds of video before and after you take a picture, with the aim of adding a little bit of life and movement to still images. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-camera.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965155" /><br/>
Since introducing Live Photos, Apple has added some effects to its Photos app that let you turn them into fun animated clips, which you can then share with family, friends, or the wider world. <br/>
<br/>
There are three effects in total that you can try on your own Live Photos. Loop repeats the action in a continuous looping video, Bounce rewinds the action backward and forward, and Long Exposure simulates a DSLR-like long exposure effect by blurring motion. <br/>
<br/>
The following steps show how you can apply them to your own Live Photos on iPhone and iPad.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Photos app and select a Live Photo. (If you look under "Media Types" in the <strong>Albums</strong> section, you'll find all of your Live Photos collated in a folder of the same name.)</li><br/>
<li>With the Live Photo open, tap the <strong>LIVE</strong> icon in the top-left corner of the interface.</li><br/>
<li>From the dropdown menu that appears, choose from <strong>Live</strong> (the default), <strong>Loop</strong>, <strong>Bounce</strong>, <strong>Long Exposure</strong>, and <strong>Off</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/loop-bounce-live-photos.jpg" alt="photos" width="2760" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004240" /><br/>
<br/>
The effect you choose will be applied immediately, ready for you to share your creation using the Share icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that with Live Photos, if you get a blurry image, you can open it up and see if other frames you captured are clearer, and then <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/make-a-new-key-photo-in-live-photos/">select a replacement "key photo" for it</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">iOS 26</a> will be compatible with the iPhone 11 and newer, according to a private account on X with a proven track record of sharing iOS-related information.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-white.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004222" /><br/>
We are unable to identify the source, but we consider them to be very reliable.<br/>
<br/>
If this rumor proves to be accurate, iOS 18 will be the final version that supports the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR. However, the devices will continue to receive security updates for the foreseeable future, even after iOS 26 is released.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 would be compatible with the following iPhone models, per this rumor:<ul><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16e</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16 Plus</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16 Pro</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16 Pro Max</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 15</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 15 Plus</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 15 Pro</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 15 Pro Max</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 14</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 14 Plus</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 14 Pro</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 14 Pro Max</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 13</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 13 mini</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 13 Pro</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 13 Pro Max</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 12</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 12 mini</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 12 Pro</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 12 Pro Max</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 11</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 11 Pro</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 11 Pro Max</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone SE (2nd generation or later)</li><br/>
</ul>Of course, iOS 26 will also be compatible with all future iPhone 17 models.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, some features will be unavailable on older iPhone models. For example, Apple Intelligence requires an iPhone 15 Pro or newer.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, the same account accurately <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ios-18-compatible-iphones-rumor/">leaked iOS 18 compatibility details</a>, so there is a good chance that their latest information is true.<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/wwdc-2025-ios-26-rumors/">WWDC 2025: iOS 26 Rumored Features</a></strong></li></ul>The first iOS 26 beta should be released following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/">WWDC 2025 keynote on June 9</a>, and the update should be released to everyone in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/ios-26-compatible-iphones-rumor/">Will iOS 26 Be Compatible With Your iPhone?

		<description><![CDATA[While the spotlight has been on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">CarPlay Ultra</a> lately, the regular version of CarPlay is set to receive some enhancements alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">iOS 26</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2015/02/carplay-hero-dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969121" /><br/>
Apple will announce iOS 26 at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> next week, and the software update is expected to upgrade the CarPlay experience in at least two ways.<br/>
<br/>
The first iOS 26 beta should be seeded to developers shortly after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/">Apple's keynote</a>, and the update will likely be released in September.<br/>
<br/>
There will likely be more CarPlay changes alongside iOS 26 — these are just the known ones.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Design</h2><br/>
<em>9to5Mac</em> this week <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">reported</a> that at least some of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-visionos-redesign-rumors/">iOS 26's rumored design changes</a> will extend to the CarPlay interface, which would make sense.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 is expected to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-sleek-peek/">sleeker, glass-like design</a> with added translucency for app icons, menus, buttons, and other elements.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Sound Recognition for Crying Babies</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CarPlay-Sound-Recognition.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="718" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950848" /><br/>
CarPlay <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features-for-carplay/">gained support for Sound Recognition</a> with iOS 18 last year. The accessibility feature can alert drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing to horns and sirens outside of the vehicle, such as from a police car, ambulance, or fire truck.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, Apple previewed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/apple-previews-ios-19-accessibility-features/">new accessibility features coming in iOS 26</a>, including an expansion of Sound Recognition for CarPlay. With the update, the feature will be able to provide a notification if it hears a crying baby inside the vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said CarPlay will also be getting a Large Text option, which has long existed on iPhones.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/ios-26-to-upgrade-carplay-in-two-ways/">iOS 26 to Upgrade CarPlay in Two Ways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-to-upgrade-carplay-in-two-ways.2458177/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Music could get more visual flair in iOS 26 with full-screen animated artwork coming to the Lock Screen, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/apple-music-lock-screen.jpg" alt="" width="5386" height="3030" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004174" /><br/>
The rumored feature would expand on recent changes to the Lock Screen's Now Playing view. Currently, maximized album artwork from the Now Playing widget tints the entire interface, creating a more immersive experience when controlling music playback.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 appears set to take that concept further by introducing animated artwork that fills the entire Lock Screen, making album covers and other visuals more dynamic and engaging.<br/>
<br/>
The new iOS 26 features are expected to be unveiled at the WWDC keynote event on Monday, June 9.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Notes app is rumored to be getting Markdown support in iOS 26 and macOS 26, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The feature would allow users to format text using simple syntax rather than relying on the app's current rich text controls.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iOS-26-Mock-Rainbow-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003293" /><br/>
Markdown support would be a major upgrade for power users who prefer keyboard-driven formatting. Instead of tapping buttons to bold text or create headers, users could type **bold** or # Header directly into their notes.<br/>
<br/>
The addition would put Apple Notes on par with popular note-taking apps like Obsidian, Notion, and Bear, which have long supported the lightweight markup language. For developers and writers already familiar with Markdown from platforms like GitHub or Reddit, it would also eliminate the need to switch between apps.<br/>
<br/>
If the rumor holds up, it's likely to be unveiled at next week's Worldwide Developers Conference alongside other iOS 26 improvements, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/ios-26-messages-app-rumors/">automatic translation and polls in Messages</a>, not to mention a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-believes-users-love-major-ios-19-redesign/">major visual redesign</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS 26 Tahoe</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-notes/">Apple Notes</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/apple-notes-rumored-markdown-support-ios-26/">Apple Notes Expected to Gain Markdown Support in iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-notes-expected-to-gain-markdown-support-in-ios-26.2458174/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Designer Sebastiaan de With has published an impressive preview of what <a href="https://www.lux.camera/physicality-the-new-age-of-ui/">Apple's rumored iOS redesign might look like</a>, complete with detailed mockups and a design philosophy that he believes could reshape how users interact with their devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/sebastian-de-with-living-glass.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004156" /><br/>
With WWDC just days away, de With – co-founder of photography app maker Lux and former Apple designer – has created what he calls "Living Glass" concepts that imagine interfaces matching the material properties of Apple's glass-screened devices.<br/>
<br/>
"Philosophically, if I was Apple, I'd describe this as finally having an interface that matches the beautiful material properties of its devices," de With writes. "This brings an interface of a matching material, giving the user a feeling of the glass itself coming alive."<br/>
<br/>
The designer's vision extends far beyond cosmetic changes, however. Using visionOS as a cue, De With proposes a fundamental shift toward "physicality" – interfaces that behave like real materials through dynamic lighting, reflections, and environmental responsiveness.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Tracing iOS Evolution</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iphone-os.jpeg" alt="" width="959" height="888" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004157" /><br/>
To provide historical context to his vision, De With traces iOS design through three distinct eras. He identifies the "Shaded Age," running from iPhone OS through iOS 6, that relied heavily on skeuomorphism, using realistic textures and shadows to help users transition from physical buttons to touchscreens.<br/>
<br/>
Then came the so-called "Flat Age," beginning with iOS 7's controversial redesign, which stripped away visual effects in favor of clean typography and minimal chrome. It was initially stark, but de With notes that iOS gradually regained depth through blur effects and subtle shadows over the years.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/flat-age-ios.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="890" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004158" /><br/>
Now, de With sees hints of a third era emerging through features like Dynamic Island and the new Siri animation – elements that behave like physical materials rather than static graphics.<br/>
<br/>
"We've come back, in a sense, to skeuomorphic interfaces – but this time not with a lacquer resembling a material," he explains. "Instead, the interface is clear, graphic and behaves like things we know from the real world."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Glass as Interface Material</h2><br/>
The designer's "Living Glass" concept treats all UI elements as dynamic glass surfaces that reflect, refract, and respond to their environment, so buttons cast realistic shadows, reflect bright content, and exhibit properties like surface tension when merging together.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Glass-UI-de-with.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004159" /><br/>
As he sees it, the approach would create a visual hierarchy through different glass treatments, such as glossy elements for primary actions, frosted surfaces for secondary controls, and inlaid elements that appear embedded in the screen itself.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/living-glass-de-with.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004162" /><br/>
De With's mockups show tab bars floating above content, app icons with dynamic reflections, and controls that emerge from background surfaces when activated. As envisioned, the system would handle these effects automatically, ensuring consistency across all apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Mica-Video-Playback-de-with.jpg" alt="" width="2976" height="1531" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004160" /><br/>
The designer points to recent changes to iOS to support his theory, such as Apple's work on automatic icon masking in iOS 18, as evidenced in Dark Mode and tinted icon effects on an identical black gradient icon backdrop. De With suggests these could be preparation for more dynamic backdrops.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Beyond Visual Polish</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/ios-icons-de-with.jpg" alt="" width="1858" height="1280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004161" /><br/>
De With argues that current design tools like Figma are unable to create the dynamic lighting and responsive behaviors that he envisions, and that could potentially give Apple a competitive advantage if it's difficult to replicate.<br/>
<br/>
His concepts also echo Apple's broader design philosophy of hardware-software integration. For example, just as early Mac OS X's translucent Aqua interface complemented colorful iMac enclosures, "Living Glass" could make software feel native to glass-screened devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/de-with-button-design.jpg" alt="" width="1850" height="620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004163" /><br/>
De With isn't blind to the challenges in bringing such complexity to a platform used by millions of third-party developers, but he argues there are parallels to Apple's previous platform transitions, which ultimately raised the bar for interface design across the industry.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>WWDC Expectations</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/WWDC-2025-Banner.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002300" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-believes-users-love-major-ios-19-redesign/">Recent reports</a> from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman describe Apple's coming redesign as featuring "glassy" effects inspired by visionOS. Apple has also tagged WWDC as its "sleek peek" event.<br/>
<br/>
Whether Apple's actual plans match de With's vision remains to be seen. But his detailed reasoning should be enough to make even the most cynical Apple device users excited about what the company is set to preview next week for iOS 26 and its other operating systems.<br/>
<br/>
"Only Apple can push the state of the art to a new interface that brings the glass of your screen to life," de With concludes. "We'll see at WWDC."

		<description><![CDATA[The 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference is coming up quick, with less than a week to go before the big keynote event. We're sharing a series of rumor recaps this week, for those who want to get a sneak peek at some of the features expected in Apple's upcoming software updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iOS-26-Mock-Rainbow-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003293" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> is definitely the OS that we've heard the most about, and rumors suggest that it's going to get a major design overhaul. We've highlighted everything we know below.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Naming</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is not going to iOS 19, with Apple instead opting to change the numbering for its software updates. Instead, we're going to get &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, which will be released alongside iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-19-to-26-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003962" /><br/>
The "26" in the name marks the September 2025 to September 2026 release season for &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. Next year we'll get iOS 27, then iOS 28, and so on. All software updates now share the same year number, which makes it easier to keep new releases straight.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design Updates</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is going to get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">major design revamp</a>, adopting some visual elements from the visionOS operating system. Inside Apple, the design project is referred to as "Solarium," which hints at what we can expect.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-19-visionOS-UI-Elements.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994345" /><br/>
A solarium is an all-glass room that's designed to let in sunlight, and rumors suggest that &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; will adopt a more translucent, glass-inspired aesthetic.<br/>
<br/>
visionOS has a translucent interface to allow people to see their surroundings in AR or VR while also interacting with app menus and windows. visionOS windows blend into the background for an unobtrusive look, and on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple could adopt the same translucent focus to let content shine through.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is also expected to get some of the floating on-screen windows and menus that are used in visionOS, with rounded pop-up navigation and menu bars that float above the content on the display. Apple could use shading, shadowing, and subtle lighting effects to give buttons and other interface elements a slight lift.<br/>
<br/>
App icons could be rounder, and notifications, menus in apps, search bars, card-style interfaces, and other parts of the iOS user interface could have more rounded corners than we're used to. The floating navigation bars are expected to be pill-shaped, for example.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; has been described as having a glossy or glass-like look, which is also how visionOS looks. Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> teaser images feature a frosted glass rainbow with soft colors, and those images might hint at what's coming. Apple could use a soft, frosted glass style across &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Mockups that are allegedly based on real &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; designs were shared earlier this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-19-visionos-like-design-rumors/">by Front Page Tech</a>, demonstrating some of the design changes that might be in store.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985937" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Alleged-iOS-19-Camera-App-Render.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="794" /><em>A render of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;'s alleged redesigned Camera app, from Front Page Tech</em></div><br/>
A mockup of the Camera app, for example, has translucent pop-out menus that better blend into the background to put the focus on the images.<br/>
<br/>
Newer Apple apps like Apple Sports and Invites have simpler, translucent interface elements with expanding buttons, and could also serve as an example of the design language Apple is debuting in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988149" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-invites-screenshots.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple is planning to overhaul its built-in apps with the updated design, though some will get bigger refreshes than others. Apple will also provide developers with design guidelines and assets so that third-party apps can adopt the new aesthetic as well.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Navigation Simplification and Streamlining</h2><br/>
Along with a new look, Apple is also going to streamline navigation options in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. Apple is tweaking menus, buttons, and navigation to make the operating system simpler to learn and navigate.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the design and interface changes will also extend to macOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS, improving design consistency and navigation across Apple's operating systems.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Features</h2><br/>
There are several new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features that are expected in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>AI Battery Management</h3><br/>
An AI-powered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/ios-19-ai-battery-management/">battery management feature</a> will analyze how you use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and make adjustments to maximize battery life. The option will be able to limit the power draw of apps and other system features based on device usage.<br/>
<br/>
Battery management will be particularly useful for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> that will have a smaller battery than other iPhones, but it will be available on iPhones that are able to run &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Shortcuts App</h3><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/shortcuts-app-apple-intelligence-integration/">update the Shortcuts app</a> with &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, allowing users to create actions that use &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; models. With this functionality, Shortcuts could be easier to use, with even casual users able to create useful shortcuts using natural language.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Google Gemini</h3><br/>
Apple and Google are close to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/ios-19-google-gemini-integration-likely/">establishing a deal</a> that will add Google Gemini to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as an alternative to ChatGPT, and that's a feature that we'll likely see in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. Google Gemini would integrate with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> like ChatGPT, with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; able to hand requests over to Gemini for more in-depth AI-powered answers.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Siri</h3><br/>
We're <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-ios-19-siri-delay/">still waiting</a> on all of the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that Apple debuted at WWDC 2024. Those updates are expected to come at some point in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, but they may not be ready for the launch version of the software. If the functionality isn't ready to go, Apple isn't going to mention it at &zwnj;WWDC 2025&zwnj; to avoid further embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what's coming, eventually:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Personal Context</strong> - &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to keep track of everything on your device, like emails, messages, files, and more, helping you complete tasks and find things.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Onscreen awareness</strong> - &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will know what's on your screen and will be able to complete actions involving whatever you're looking at.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Deeper App Integration</strong> - &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do more in and across apps, performing actions and tasks that are not possible with the personal assistant right now. This will be a feature available for Apple's apps and third-party apps.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Gaming App</h2><br/>
Apple has a new gaming app planned, and it'll replace Game Center and add more functionality than ever before. It's going to house the games section of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, so you'll be able to find and launch games from one convenient gaming-centric spot.<br/>
<br/>
The app is also expected to feature communication options for connecting with other players, in-game achievements, editorial content and recommendations, and leaderboards.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Features for Existing Apps</h2><br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that there are several new features coming to existing Apple apps.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> - Automatic translations and support for polls.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Music</strong> - Full screen animated art on the Lock Screen.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Notes</strong> - Markdown support.</li><br/>
<li><strong>CarPlay</strong> - Updated user interface to match &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods Live Translate</h2><br/>
With an AirPods firmware update, an &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; feature will allow the AirPods to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/airpods-live-translation-ios-19/">translate in-person conversations</a> from one language to another. If an English speaker with AirPods is conversing with someone who is speaking Spanish, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will detect the audio, translate the speech, and relay it back in English to the AirPods wearer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Connectivity</h2><br/>
Apple is adding a new feature that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/ios-19-sync-captive-wi-fi-data-between-devices/">will synchronize</a> captive Wi-Fi portal login information across devices, so you'll only need to enter login details for a captive Wi-Fi network once, and it'll be available on all of your Apple products. Captive networks are common in hotels, airports, coffee shops, and other locations with shared or paid internet options.<br/>
<br/>
Apple might also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/ios-19-esim-android-transfer/">make it easier</a> for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to transfer an eSIM to an Android smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Health App</h2><br/>
There's a new Health app coming, but it might not be ready when &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; launches, so Apple might not be planning to unveil it just yet. The revamped app will apparently offer AI-powered health coating features with personalized health recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
There may also be new food tracking functionality that would allow users to keep track of their calorie intake each day.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Stage Manager</h2><br/>
There's a possibility that Apple will add a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/">Stage Manager</a> feature for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models that have a USB-C port, with the feature activating when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is connected to an external display over USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Stage Manager&zwnj; would allow multiple apps to be opened at once, offering a more Mac-like experience when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is used with a display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Accessibility Features</h2><br/>
Apple previewed new Accessibility features coming to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; earlier this year, and there are some interesting new additions.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Music Haptics</strong> - Music Haptics will get customization options so haptics can be enabled for an entire song or just vocals, plus there will be options to adjust the intensity of taps, textures, and vibrations.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>App Store Labels</strong> - &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; product pages will get Accessibility Nutrition Labels that highlight accessibility features in apps.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Accessibility Reader</strong> - Accessibility Reader is a systemwide reading mode that will make text easier to read thanks to customization features for adjusting font, color, spacing, and more.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>CarPlay</strong> - <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> is getting support for Large Text, and Sound Recognition will be able to alert drivers to the sound of a crying baby.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Background Sounds</strong> - Background Sounds will be customizable with new EQ settings, timers, and automation actions in Shortcuts.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Personal Voice</strong> - Personal Voice will let users preserve their voice faster and more easily. It will use on-device machine learning to create a smoother, more natural-sounding voice in under a minute.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Tracking</strong> - Head tracking and eye tracking are getting updates, plus Apple is adding support for Brain Computer Interface devices.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>iPadOS 26</h2><br/>
iPadOS 26 is going to get the same design updates that are coming to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, so it will have the same glass-like, translucent look.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/">adding new features</a> that will make the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> experience more like using a Mac, introducing improved productivity, new multitasking features, and expanded window management options.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 26 may have a Mac-like menu bar when connected to a Magic Keyboard, plus Apple is adding a new reed calligraphy pen option for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> users that need to write Arabic script.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Compatibility</h2><br/>
Rumors suggest that &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; will not be available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XR, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS, or the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS Max, but it will run on all other iPhones that support &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;.<br/>

 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Plus</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro Max</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 mini</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro Max</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12</li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a></li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro</li><br/>

 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2nd generation or later)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
While these iPhones will support &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, advanced features may be limited to newer iPhones with faster processors. &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, for example, only runs on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro and the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> Messages app will include a new translate feature, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>. Messages will apparently be able to automatically translate incoming and outgoing messages when you're conversing with someone who speaks another language.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/General-Apps-Messages-Redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985161" /><br/>
You can already long press on an incoming message and choose the translate option to translate it to another language, but it seems the process could be sped up with automatic translation options.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also said to be planning to add an option for a polls in the Messages, which would allow people in group chats to vote. The polls option could be powered by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, with Apple suggesting polling categories.<br/>
<br/>
<em>9to5Mac</em> claims that Apple is also working on several other features:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Airthings is a company known for its air quality sensors, and today it introduced its newest digital radon detector, the <a href="https://www.airthings.com/products/corentium-home-2">Corentium Home 2</a>. Depending on where you live, you may or may not be aware of radon, but exposure to radon over time can lead to lung cancer, and many people aren't aware that there's radon in their homes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/airthings-corentium.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003697" /><br/>
The Corentium Home 2 is a follow up to the original Corentium Home, and while it does not include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, it does have an iOS app that's able to connect to your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> over Bluetooth to deliver regular readings. It monitors radon levels, humidity, and temperature, and can send an alert if levels exceed a set threshold. When a reading is out of range, the display will let you know, so you can open the app to download the data to check in. Wi-Fi would be nice to have for continual data without the need to connect, but so far, the connection and data downloads have been quick and reliable.<br/>
<br/>
Design wise, the Corentium Home 2 is fairly simple. It's made from black plastic, with a small square screen where you can see the radon, humidity, and temperature readings at a glance. There's a button on the front that cycles through each view, and that's about it except for a battery compartment and a button inside the battery compartment that activates Bluetooth. It connects to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; over Bluetooth to sync data to the accompanying app, and the app has the same straightforward design.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004133" /><br/>
The app features current radon, humidity, and temperature levels, along with options to view results over time. Options include 24 hours, seven days, 30 days, and a year. You'll see averages over each time period, but you can also tap into each section for more granular data. When you're viewing data, the app has a neat haptic feature. When you tap along the line graph, rather than just jumping from one spot to another, it will quickly run through the different averages, which is useful for getting an in-depth look in just a few seconds.<br/>
<br/>
The app and the graph use green for "good" radon readings, yellow for readings that exceed the good category, and red for danger zone readings, while it uses the same colors for humidity and adds blue for temperature. The app has built-in thresholds that aren't customizable, but seem to be based on generally accepted ideal indoor radon, humidity, and temperature settings.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004134" /><br/>
As long as radon readings are below 2.7 pCi/L (that's picocuries per liter), the app and the sensor won't raise an alarm. The yellow zone is between 2.7 pCi/L and 4 pCi/L, while the red zone is above 4 pCi/L. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggests that people address radon at levels between 2 pCi/L and 4 pCi/L, with a stronger recommendation at above 4 pCi/L.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-app-interface.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004136" /><br/>
For temperature, the Corentium Home 2 green zone is between 64 and 77 degrees, the red zone is above 77 degrees (aka it's hot), and the blue zone is below 64 degrees (it's cold). Humidity is red above 70 percent and below 25 percent (these extremes are unpleasant for people and for wood floors and items in your home), yellow between 25 and 30 percent and also 60 and 70 percent, and green between 30 and 60 percent. The EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/care-your-air-guide-indoor-air-quality">recommends</a> humidity levels between 30 and 50 for optimal comfort, but the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute <a href="https://www.ahrinet.org/scholarships-education/education-professionals-homeowners/contractors-and-specifiers/hvacr-equipmentcomponents/humidifiers#:~:text=The%20American%20Society%20of%20Heating,living%20while%20preventing%20mold%20growth">recommends</a> between 40 and 60 percent. Drier air can lead to dry mucus membranes and an increase in infections, while moister air can cause mold. Ideals may vary based on climate and personal preference, so I do wish Airthings allowed the thresholds for temperature and humidity to be adjusted if needed.<br/>
<br/>
You can opt in or opt out of alerts for radon, temperature, and humidity. Radon alerts are turned on by default, but can be toggled off in the app's settings, while the other options can be toggled on. Units of measurement can be changed in the app, and there's also an option to check pollen levels if you provide the app with your location.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004135" /><br/>
There are much more affordable temperature and humidity sensors on the market, so most people are likely going to want to pick up the Corentium Home 2 for the radon detection, with temperature and humidity readings serving as a bonus. There are multiple kinds of radon testing. Some are small packets of activated charcoal that you leave in place before sending them off to a lab, while there are also expensive professional level testing machines and mid-tier sensors like the Corentium Home 2.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-temperature-humidity.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004138" /><br/>
The mail-in tests are the most affordable and the professional tests are the most expensive, but neither provides monitoring over time like the Corentium Home 2 does. Radon is a significant enough issue that if you're in an area with radon levels that are known to be high, keeping an eye on radon levels over time can provide peace of mind.<br/>
<br/>
The EPA has a radon zone map [<a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-05/radon-zones-map_text_link.pdf">PDF</a>], and much of the U.S. has high to moderate potential for indoor radon levels over 2 pCi/L. Radon comes from soil, rock, and groundwater, and it can seep into your home without you knowing because it is invisible and has no odor. The EPA estimates that there are 21,000 radon-related lung cancer deaths each year, and there is no established "safe" level of radon exposure. Exposure is continuous even at low levels, and it is the leading cause of lung cancer in people who do not smoke.<br/>
<br/>
I had average radon levels of 5.7 pCi/L in my house, and it sometimes spiked to 8 pCi/L, so I am familiar with radon and radon testing. I have had my home radon tested several times, before and after a radon mitigation system was installed. I don't have a recent professional test (the last was in 2023), but the levels that the Corentium Home 2 show are in line with the results of the post mitigation testing that I had done (below 2 pCi/L on average).<br/>
<br/>
The Corentium Home 2's radon readouts appear to be accurate to me, as are the temperature and humidity sensors. I have several SensorPush sensors that I use regularly and that are calibrated, and the Corentium Home 2 is generally within a percent on both temperature and humidity each time I've checked.<br/>
<br/>
Even with a radon mitigation system, an option to see radon levels continually prevents anxiety over spikes in concentration and settles the question of whether mitigation is working. Radon levels can fluctuate quite a bit depending on outdoor conditions, time of year, and other factors, plus they can vary by room, so the other great thing about the Corentium Home 2 is that you can move it around and make sure there are no hot spots.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-radon.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004137" /><br/>
Radon monitors are typically placed in the lowest area of the home (that's where the gas settles), and several feet from a door or window that's opened regularly, because that can affect the readout. With the Corentium Home 2, you'll get your first reading within 24 hours, and continual readings after that. You need to test for around 30 days to get a clear picture of radon over time, and data will download from the device to the app each time you open up the app.<br/>
<br/>
If it turns out that you do have a radon issue, the app can provide information on what to do about it. You can also turn on a "Connect with a professional" setting that will automatically contact a local company that deals with radon if you get a high reading, but I think most people are intelligent enough to seek out their own help.<br/>
<br/>
The Corentium Home 2 operates on two AA batteries. I'm not yet sure how long the batteries will last, but AA is a battery type a lot of people keep on hand, and battery use seems minimal given that data is transferred over Bluetooth.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
Most of us have carbon monoxide sensors and smoke detectors in our homes, but radon can be just as dangerous. The Corentium Home 2 is &#36;180, which feels like a reasonable price to pay to be able to keep an eye on radon fluctuations over time.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have a radon mitigation system or aren't familiar with radon, it can let you know if there's a problem. If you do have mitigation already and are aware of an issue, it can let you know that your system is working as intended.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2><br/>
The Corentium Home 2 can be purchased <a href="https://www.airthings.com/products/corentium-home-2">from the Airthings website</a> or <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAirthings-325-Corentium-Digital-Detector%2Fdp%2FB0F84C4ZZM%3F">from Amazon</a> for &#36;180.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/corentium-home-2/">Review: iPhone-Connected Corentium Home 2 Radon Monitor Provides Peace of Mind</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-iphone-connected-corentium-home-2-radon-monitor-provides-peace-of-mind.2458154/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung recently launched the Galaxy S25 Edge, a super thin smartphone that will compete with Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>. To see what it's like using such a thin phone, <em>MacRumors</em> video editor Dan Barbera used it as his main device for two weeks to see what it might be like to use Apple's equivalent later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iPhone User Switches to Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZpfXRCtth8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch display, so it's a larger smartphone, but because it's so thin and light, it's easy to hold. It's just 5.8mm thick and it weighs 163 grams, and it's so light that it almost feels like a plastic dummy phone. Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; could be even thinner at 5.5mm, and it will have a similar display size at 6.6 inches, so it should be a lot like the S25 Edge.<br/>
<br/>
These super thin smartphones need to be used without a case to get the full effect, since a case is just going to increase the weight and thickness. A slim case might not be too bad, but it seems silly to shell out money for a super thin smartphone just to stick it inside a thick case.<br/>
<br/>
With such a thin body, the Galaxy S25 Edge doesn't have as much room for a battery as other Samsung smartphones, so battery life is lacking. It's still possible to get through the day without a charge, but if you're a heavy user, you're probably going to need to top up your battery every so often during the day. Samsung has battery optimization settings that prioritize battery life, but those options affect game performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will likely have some of the same issues with battery life, though optimizations are being implemented through AI battery settings in iOS 19. The efficiency of the C1 modem that the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will use will also help, plus Apple is going to sell an add-on battery pack alongside it.<br/>
<br/>
Camera functionality is a tradeoff on the Galaxy S25 Edge, because it only has the 200-megapixel main lens and a 12-megapixel ultra wide lens with no telephoto lens. Other Samsung devices have triple-lens camera setups. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will suffer from the same issue, and it's only going to get a single-lens main camera due to space constraints.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung is selling the Galaxy S25 Edge for &#36;1,100, which is not too far off from the higher-end and more feature rich Galaxy smartphones. Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; could come in cheaper at around &#36;899, but that pricing plan was before any potential increases due to tariffs.<br/>
<br/>
Do you plan to get the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; this year? How do you think it will measure up to the S25 Edge?

		<title>iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Fold Said to Use A20 Chip With New Design</title>

		<description><![CDATA[While the iPhone 17 series is still three months away from launching, rumors about next year's iPhone 18 models continue to surface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-Top-Left-Hole-Punch-Face-ID-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000739" /><br/>
The latest word comes from Apple analyst Jeff Pu. In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu said that he expects the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and so-called iPhone 18 Fold to be equipped with Apple's A20 chip, and he believes the chip will have some key design changes over the A18 and upcoming A19 chips.<br/>
<br/>
First, Pu reiterated that the A20 chip will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process. The current A18 Pro chip in iPhone 16 Pro models is fabricated with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, while the A19 Pro chip for the iPhone 17 Pro models is expected to use TSMC's third-generation 3nm process. The move from 3nm to 2nm starting with the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Fold models would allow for more transistors in each chip, which helps to boost performance. Specifically, previous reports indicated that A20 chips should be up to 15% faster and up to 30% more power efficient than A19 chips.<br/>
<br/>
An overview of current and expected iPhone chips:<ul><li>A17 Pro chip: 3nm (TSMC's first-generation 3nm process N3B)</li><br/>
<li>A18 chips: 3nm (TSMC's second-generation 3nm process N3E)</li><br/>
<li>A19 chips: 3nm (TSMC's third-generation 3nm process N3P)</li><br/>
<li>A20 chips: 2nm (TSMC's first-generation 2nm process N2)</li></ul>Keep in mind that these nanometer sizes like 3nm and 2nm are simply TSMC marketing terms, rather than actual measurements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/a20-chip-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995953" /><br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/kuo-a20-chip-2nm/">also expects the A20 chip to be 2nm</a>, which is not very surprising if you look at the iPhone chip trajectory.<br/>
<br/>
There is another alleged change that would be more notable. In addition to the 2nm process, Pu said that he expects the A20 chip to use TSMC's newer Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) chip packaging technology. With this new design, RAM would be integrated directly onto the chip's wafer with the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, rather than being adjacent to the chip and connected with a silicon interposer.<br/>
<br/>
This packaging change could contribute to a wide range of benefits for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Fold over previous models, including faster performance for both overall tasks and Apple Intelligence, longer battery life, and improved thermal management. The change could also result in the A20 chip having a smaller footprint than previous chips, which could free up space inside the iPhones for other uses.<br/>
<br/>
This packaging change for the A20 chip has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/iphone-18-enhanced-2nm-chip-12gb-ram/">also been rumored previously</a>.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, the A20 chip is shaping up to be a big upgrade for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Fold models, which should launch in September 2026.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-18-pro-a20-chip-with-new-design/">iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Fold Said to Use A20 Chip With New Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-and-iphone-18-fold-said-to-use-a20-chip-with-new-design.2458146/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has announced that its <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/retail/denhaag">Den Haag retail store</a> in the Netherlands will be reopening on Thursday, August 14, following a temporary closure.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Apple-Store-Den-Haag.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003475" /><br/>
As we previously reported, the store has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/apple-den-haag-temporarily-closing/">closed since June 1</a> for renovations, but Apple had not announced a reopening date until now.<br/>
<br/>
First opened in 2014, Apple Den Haag is located in The Hague, in the province of South Holland. The location is one of Apple's flagship stores, with beautiful historical architecture. It is located in a covered walkway, known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_(architecture)">arcade</a>. The remodeled store may feature an Apple Pickup station for online orders, but the exact changes planned are unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has two other stores in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam and Haarlem.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[All Apple Watch models include a stock Calculator app that offers a couple of handy features for working out how much you should tip when eating out and how much each person in a group owes if you're splitting the bill.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/split-bill-tip-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004068" /><br/>
The two functions can be used together, but if it's just yourself dining out then you can just leave the People field set to 1. The steps below show you how it works.  <br/>
<br/>
Note: If you see a standard percentage (%) button where the TIP button should be, you can change the calculator layout to replace it. Simply go to <strong>Settings ➝ Calculator</strong> and select <strong>Tip Function</strong> instead of <strong>Percent</strong>. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Use the Split Bill and Tip Calculator Functions on Apple Watch</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> is one of Europe's top-selling smartphones, yet its early sales figures still lagged significantly behind those of Apple's previous mid-tier models, according to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/iphone-16e-enters-europes-top-10-in-first-month/">Counterpoint Research</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-990894" /><br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; launched in February, marking the company's first attempt in recent years to redefine its mid-range offerings with a product distinct from its "SE" branding. Despite debuting on Europe's Top 10 smartphones list in its first full month of availability, the model failed to match the initial traction of its predecessors. <br/>
<br/>
Counterpoint Research finds that the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; was the ninth best-selling smartphone in Europe in March, representing 8% of Apple's total <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales in the region and 2% of the broader smartphone market. In Western Europe, the device performed slightly better, securing the seventh position overall.<br/>
<br/>
However, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;'s early performance marks a clear departure from the success of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE models that preceded it. The third-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE from 2022 ranked sixth on the same European bestseller list during its first month and accounted for 12% of Apple's regional &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE from 2020 performed even more strongly, achieving third place overall and making up 19% of Apple's European &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales in its debut month. Compared to these benchmarks, &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; sales were down 17% versus the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2022) and down 20% compared to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2020), according to Counterpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, the primary reason identified for the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;'s weaker debut is its higher launch price. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; generally starts at €699 in Europe. This is a significant increase over the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2022), which debuted at €519, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2020), which launched at €479. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the mid-tier smartphone market in Europe is increasingly price-sensitive; consumers are showing increased interest in refurbished and second-hand iPhones, which further complicates Apple's efforts to drive volume through new mid-range hardware. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/">Counterpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-16e-sales-lag-behind-se-models/">iPhone 16e Sales Lag Behind SE Models Despite Bestseller Status</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-sales-lag-behind-se-models-despite-bestseller-status.2458137/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Will Apple Announce Any New Hardware at WWDC 2025 Next Week?</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> is fast approaching, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/">Apple's opening keynote</a> set to begin on Monday, June 9 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time. Apple always uses the annual developer conference to unveil the latest versions of its software platforms, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26</a> all expected to be announced next week. But a key question remains: will there be any hardware announcements too?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/WWDC-2025-Apple-Logo.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004059" /><br/>
The answer to that question is likely no. In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter last weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/01/wwdc-2025-likely-smaller-scale/">Apple has no major new devices ready to ship</a>, so there might not be any hardware announcements at WWDC 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could still surprise us on the hardware front, of course, and Gurman did not explicitly rule out smaller device announcements.<br/>
<br/>
WWDC is always focused on software, but there are hardware announcements at the conference in some years. Most recently, Apple unveiled the Vision Pro and updated three Mac models at WWDC 2023. In 2024, however, it was a software-only affair.<br/>
<br/>
The only rumored Apple product that might be imminent is an AirTag 2. Gurman previously said that he expected a new AirTag <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/">to be released around mid-2025</a>, but he has not mentioned the accessory in a while, so it is unclear if that timeframe remains accurate. Even if an AirTag 2 is coming soon, there is no guarantee that it will be unveiled during the WWDC 2025 keynote, as Apple could opt to announce it with a press release only.<br/>
<br/>
The majority of Macs have been updated since October 2024, with the only exception being the high-end Mac Pro desktop tower. The current Mac Pro is equipped with Apple's M2 Ultra chip, so in theory it could be updated with the M3 Ultra chip that debuted in the Mac Studio this year, but that has not been rumored. It is also looking <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/m4-ultra-chip-is-unlikely/">unlikely that Apple will ever release an M4 Ultra chip</a>, so the Mac Pro's path forward is currently unclear.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the entire iPad lineup has been updated since May 2024, so new iPad models are unlikely to be announced at WWDC 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPhone and Apple Watch models are expected to launch in September, as usual, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/">new Apple TV and HomePod mini models are rumored to launch in September or later this year</a>. AirPods Pro 3 are also rumored to launch later this year, at the earliest, while new AirPods Max are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/when-to-expect-airpods-max-2/">not expected to launch until 2027</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There have been on-again, off-again rumors about a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/vision-pro-2-with-m5-may-not-launch-until-2026/">Vision Pro 2 with an M5 chip</a>, but it is unclear if that would launch in 2025 or 2026.<br/>
<br/>
A new version of Apple's standalone Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting has been rumored, but it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">not expected to launch until late 2025 or early 2026</a>. Apple's higher-end Pro Display XDR has not been updated since it first launched in 2019, but it is unclear if and when a new version of the display will be released.<br/>
<br/>
Last, Apple's rumored smart home hub <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-smart-home-hub-postponed/">has been postponed</a> due to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delayed Siri features</a>, so do not expect that device to launch at WWDC 2025. However, it is plausible that Apple could provide an early preview of the device at the conference. Gurman said that the device will not have an App Store, but there could be new APIs for developers.<br/>
<br/>
That wraps up where things stand. As mentioned, though, a surprise or two is always possible. <br/>
<br/>
The keynote will be streamed on Apple's website, in the Apple TV app, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/">on YouTube</a>. On-demand playback will be available afterwards.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/wwdc-2025-new-hardware-or-not/">Will Apple Announce Any New Hardware at WWDC 2025 Next Week?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-apple-announce-any-new-hardware-at-wwdc-2025-next-week.2458135/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
