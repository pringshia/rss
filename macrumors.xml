		<description><![CDATA[CalDigit's <a href="https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-station-4/">Thunderbolt Station 4</a> (TS4) is a dock with 98W charging power and an impressive array of 18 ports, ideal for Mac setups with a wide range of connection requirements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-main.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909894" /><br/>
The dock comes with a price tag of &#36;399.99, reflective of its high-speed data transfer, expansive connectivity, and powerful charging abilities. While it may not be the most budget-friendly option on the market, its performance and convenience make a compelling case for professionals with demanding workloads and complex Mac setups. In this review, we delve into the TS4's capabilities to determine whether its cost is justified, and help you understand if it is the right fit for your specific needs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-connected.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909892" /><br/>
The dock comes with a 0.8m Thunderbolt 4 Cable, two rubber feet strips, one power cord, one 230W power supply, and a two-year CalDigit warranty.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Design</h3><br/>
The CalDigit TS4 dock features a high-quality, durable aluminum design. Its overall footprint is reasonably compact, measuring 141mm x 42mm x 113mm, meaning that it avoids taking too much space on a desk. If that is too tall for your desktop, just slide on the included pair of rubber strips for cushioning and tip the dock over on its side. The aluminum casing has a ribbed design that gives it a more industrial look while also offering some extra surface area for effective heat dissipation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-sideways.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909897" /><br/>
The TS4's design, despite its compactness, does not compromise on functionality. It houses an impressive total of 18 ports that are logically divided between the front and rear of the dock. The front features easily accessible USB-C, USB-A, and SD card slots, alongside an audio input and output port. The back, meanwhile, is equipped with the remaining ports, including Thunderbolt 4, USB-C, USB-A, DisplayPort, and Ethernet.<br/>
<br/>
The dock is accompanied by a large power brick that, while necessary for its function, detracts slightly from the portability of the device and is an important consideration in terms of cable management.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>USB Ports</h3><br/>
The dock is outfitted with a total of eight USB ports, split between USB-C and USB-A variants. There are three 10Gb/s USB-C ports (two located conveniently on the front and one at the back), offering high-speed data transfer rates and power delivery. The dock also features five 10Gb/s USB-A ports to accommodate slightly older hardware. Four of these ports are located on the back of the device, and one is placed on the front for easy access.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-rear-closeup.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909895" /><br/>
One notable advantage is that the USB ports also deliver power sufficient for charging. One of the front USB-C ports delivers 20W, suitable for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charger or even a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>. The two rear Thunderbolt ports can supply 15W, while the remaining USB-C and USB-A ports offer 7.5W. This means that even in the absence of the host computer, many of the ports will continue to supply power to your devices, effectively turning the TS4 into a handy charging station.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>SD Card Slots</h3><br/>
Two slots accommodate both full-size SD and microSD cards, with UHS-II support ensuring adequate data transfer rates for photographers or videographers. The positioning of these slots on the front of the TS4 is another thoughtful touch, enabling easy access and the quick swapping of cards.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that these slots are UHS-II and not the latest UHS-III specification, which means they will not offer the absolute highest transfer speeds available on the market for users with UHS-III cards. Despite this, UHS-II is still more than fast enough for the vast majority of users.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Display Support</h3><br/>
The CalDigit TS4 offers comprehensive support for external displays, a feature that is particularly valuable for professionals who require multiple monitors for their workflow. The dock supports up to two 6K, 60Hz screens when connected via the Thunderbolt 4 ports, offering ample screen real estate. Moreover, if your requirements are focused on refresh rates, the TS4 can support up to 240Hz at a 1440p resolution. This makes it a perfect fit for graphic designers, video editors, and others who require high-resolution multi-monitor Mac setups.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-rear.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909896" /><br/>
In addition to the Thunderbolt 4 ports, the TS4 also includes a DisplayPort 1.4 port. DisplayPort 1.4 supports high resolutions and refresh rates, as well as features like HDR, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of displays. However, an HDMI port is noticeably absent on the device, which may be a drawback for those who rely on HDMI for their display setup, such as those using smaller OLED TVs as monitors.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Ethernet</h3><br/>
A 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port promises substantially faster data transfer rates compared to standard Gigabit Ethernet, offering solid performance. During use of the CalDigit TS4, the Ethernet port provided exceptional performance, delivering the highest speeds observed from the router, even when the other selection of ports were virtually maxed-out. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Audio</h3><br/>
The CalDigit TS4 Thunderbolt dock comes equipped with three audio ports, including a 3.5mm audio in port, a 3.5mm audio out port, and a 3.5mm combo jack. This trio of audio ports allows for a versatile set of use cases, catering to both input and output needs.<br/>
<br/>
The 3.5mm combo port on the front is especially handy for quickly connecting headphones. The separate 3.5mm audio input and output ports offer even more flexibility, accommodating for standalone microphones and speakers. For instance, you can connect an external microphone for better voice capture quality during video calls or audio recordings. The dedicated output port allows you to connect speakers without having to frequently unplug your headphones.<br/>
<br/>
During testing, the audio ports on the CalDigit TS4 delivered clear and high-quality sound with no noticeable distortion or noise interference. The ease of access and the quality of the audio signal make these ports an excellent feature for those needing multiple audio connectivity options on their Thunderbolt dock.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3><br/>
Overall, the CalDigit TS4 offers best-in-class connectivity as a Thunderbolt dock with an extremely versatile selection of ports. With its convenient port placement, charging capabilities, and discreet design, it is a standout choice for those seeking a multitude of connection options. The ability to connect a single Thunderbolt cable to a MacBook and instantly activate two external displays and connect to over a dozen peripherals, and even charge devices regardless of whether a computer is attached, is extremely useful.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-upright.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909898" /><br/>
<br/>
While its bulky power supply and the omission of an HDMI port may be off-putting to some users, it still offers a wide variety of features that make it a strong competitor in the market. It is easy to recommend the TS4 to any Mac user looking to level-up their setup and meet a wide range of connectivity needs.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with a "completely standard" USB-C port without any restrictions on cables or accessories, according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/contrary-to-rumors-the-iphone-15-has-a-standard-by-the-book-usb-c-port/"><em>Ars Technica</em>'s Andrew Cunningham</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
For previous iPhones with the Lightning connector, Apple limits the functionality of some cables and accessories that are not certified through its <a href="https://mfi.apple.com/">"Made for iPhone" program</a>. It was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/">rumored</a> that Apple might apply similar limitations to the USB-C port on iPhone 15 models, but this report confirms that is not the case.<br/>
<br/>
As with iPads and Macs with USB-C ports, the report said all existing USB cables, chargers, and accessories will work normally with the iPhone 15 models.<br/>
<br/>
As the report notes, it is still possible that Apple will launch a "Made for iPhone" certification program for iPhone accessories with a USB-C port, but it appears that uncertified accessories will work just fine with the devices.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models are equipped with a USB-C port, but there are differences in data transfer speeds. The lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-usb-port-limited-to-lightning-speeds/">limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds</a> of up to 480 Mbps, which is equal to Lightning, while the iPhone 15 Pro models support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-preorders-now-available/">accepting pre-orders</a> for all four iPhone 15 models earlier today. The devices launch on Friday, September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/">USB-C</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-usb-c-port-completely-standard/">iPhone 15 Models Have &#039;Completely Standard&#039; USB-C Port Without Restrictions on Accessories</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-models-have-completely-standard-usb-c-port-without-restrictions-on-accessories.2401964/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are available in an entirely refreshed range of colors thanks to a new titanium design. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; families have different color options, so if you have your heart set on a particular shade, you may not be able to get your preferred model in that color. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911423" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are available in four colors, all of which are different from those <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-colors/">available</a> on last year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> models. This year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> color options are quite different from those offered in previous years because the device now features a titanium frame with a brushed texture and contoured edges, as opposed to the polished stainless steel offered since 2017's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max's four available color options are:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Black Titanium</li><br/>
<li>White Titanium</li><br/>
<li>Blue Titanium</li><br/>
<li>Natural Titanium</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The color option that Apple previously called "Silver," encompassing a design with silver metal and white glass, has been available on iPhones for over a decade. This is now "White Titanium" on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. This shade has been tweaked to feature a slightly more beige back glass and softer overall tone.<br/>
<br/>
2022's "Space Black," which was previously "Graphite," is now simply "Black Titanium." It is more of an extremely rich, dark gray tone than deep black. Blue Titanium, on the other hand, appears to be more like navy blue, deeper than previous shades such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> Pro's Pacific Blue. Black and Blue Titanium may be more likely to attract fingerprints on account of their darker finish. Scratches, scuffs, and dents could also be more visible on these finishes than White or Natural Titanium.<br/>
<br/>
"Natural Titanium" is a wholly new shade that showcases the true color of the titanium frame with no color applied to its surface in the PVD process. The rear glass is a matching mid- to-light gray tone. The finish is very similar to that of the Apple Watch Ultra, which also has a titanium casing. It also harks back in some ways to the Space Gray finish of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6S.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-camera.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910485" /><br/>
It is worth noting that there is no &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; with a Gold finish. Gold was available through 2013's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5S to 2017's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8, and then on 2018's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS to 2022's &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj;. If you were a fan of this color in previous years, you will now need to look to one of the other options. The warm gray of Natural Titanium may be the best alternative.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="how_to_decide_on_a_color">How to Decide on a Color</h3><br/>
If you use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a case, you may wish to consider which device color will best complement it. You may prefer neutral tones such as White Titanium or Black Titanium and use a more colorful case. Alternatively, you could choose a more striking device color like Blue Titanium and use a more neutral case for an interesting contrast.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-finewoven-cases.jpg" alt="" width="2839" height="1177" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910359" /><br/>
White or Black Titanium may age better over time as new devices are released since they are more neutral, almost monochrome shades that tend to have a more timeless effect. If you do not use a case at all, you may wish to take advantage of a more eye-catching color option such as Natural or Blue Titanium.<br/>
<br/>
If you want an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in a shade that is noticeably brand new, Natural Titanium is the best option. It is most likely to indicate that you have the latest-generation device and could be the most popular color option this year since it is quite different from the offerings in recent years.<br/>
<br/>
Your choice of color may also be dependent on how often you upgrade your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. If you upgrade every year, you may be more confident in buying a more striking new color. If you upgrade more often, it can be a good idea to get a different color every time. A new finish can certainly add some novelty to purchasing a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and make it feel more different from your previous device. Alternatively, if you tend to keep your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for many years and upgrade less often, it may be wiser to consider a color that is more similar to one you have enjoyed previously.<br/>
<br/>
Customers with multiple Apple devices may also want to get an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; color that complements their other devices. For example, if you have a Midnight <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, Blue Titanium is a good match. The Apple Watch Ultra will be best complimented by Natural Titanium, while Apple Watches with stainless steel casings will be best matched by White Titanium.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-color-options/">iPhone 15 Pro Color Options: Which Did You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-color-options-which-did-you-choose.2401950/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-preorders-now-available/">accepting pre-orders</a> for the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max today, and shipping estimates for the devices on Apple's online store are already beginning to slip into November for many configurations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
As of 7:15 a.m. Pacific Time in the U.S., the iPhone 15 Pro Max is facing up to a 6-7 week shipping estimate for some configurations on Apple's online store, while the iPhone 15 Pro faces up to a 2-3 week delay for some models. The lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are largely still available for launch-day delivery.<br/>
<br/>
Inventory will inevitably continue to tighten for both delivery and Apple Store pickup as the day progresses, so order quickly if you are planning to.<br/>
<br/>
As is common when iPhone pre-orders begin, some customers have encountered errors while attempting to place their orders on Apple's website or in the Apple Store app, amid the influx in demand. The issues will likely resolve as the day progresses.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 Pro models have several new features, including a USB-C port, lightweight titanium frame, customizable Action button, faster A17 Pro chip manufactured with a 3nm process, up to 5x optical zoom on the Pro Max model, thinner bezels around the screen, Wi-Fi 6E support, an increased 8GB of RAM, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
The devices will launch in stores and begin arriving to customers on Friday, September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-pro-shipping-estimates-october/">iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max Shipping Estimates Extend Into November</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-and-pro-max-shipping-estimates-extend-into-november.2401932/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is now accepting pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max through <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/">its online storefront</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948">Apple Store app</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> app is typically the quickest way to get a pre-order in as it is often accessible before the website comes up.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-and-15-Pro-Pre-Orders-Live-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911294" /><br/>
Pre-orders are being accepted in more than 40 countries and regions around the world, and those who used Apple's "Get Ready" feature should be able to hit a button to get their orders in without hassle.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; starts at &#36;799 or &#36;33.29 per month in the United States, while pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus starts at &#36;899 or &#36;37.45 per month. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; is available starting at &#36;999 or &#36;41.62 per month, and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is available starting at &#36;1,199 or &#36;49.95 per month. Pricing will vary depending on country.<br/>
<br/>
The lowest-priced &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, 15 Plus, and 15 Pro Max models have 128GB of storage, but the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max starts with 256GB of storage. Storage upgrades are available for an increased price, with up to 1TB of storage available. Apple is encouraging customers to use trade-in credits to lower the price of the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, and it is also <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/carrier-offers">promoting carrier deals</a> from AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
All of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are equipped with USB-C ports, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a new Ultra Wideband chip, Qualcomm 5G modems, and a range of camera updates. The more affordable &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus have an A16 chip, an aluminum frame, and a frosted glass back, as well as a new 48-megapixel Main camera. There have been updates to Portrait mode, Night mode, and general improvements to image quality thanks to Smart HDR updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Colors.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910250" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models feature a new titanium frame that makes them much lighter than prior-generation models, with titanium also offering increased strength and durability. Apple replaced the mute switch with an Action button that can be customized with a number of functions, and display bezels have been slimmed down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911148" /><br/>
Pro models are also equipped with a faster A17 Pro chip with major GPU improvements that enable them to play console-level games, and they feature all of the camera improvements from the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, plus more.<br/>
<br/>
Both models have improved Ultra Wide cameras, and while the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; still has a 3x Telephoto lens, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max has a new tetraprism mechanism for its Telephoto lens, enabling 5x optical zoom.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-blue-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911150" /><br/>
It's not yet clear on whether there will be shortages of the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, but it is a good idea to pre-order right away just in case. There were rumors of production difficulties with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, so it is possible it will sell out. The 5x zoom lens, the new titanium material, and the A17 Pro chip make it especially enticing.<br/>
<br/>

U.S. carriers like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are accepting preorders for the new devices, as are other carriers worldwide. Big box retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart have pre-orders available too.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who pre-order one of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models can expect to begin receiving their deliveries on Friday, September 22, the official launch date for the new devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-preorders-now-available/">iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Models Now Available for Pre-Order</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-models-now-available-for-pre-order.2401920/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple does not advertise battery capacities for its new iPhone 15 lineup, but <em><a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/apple-iphone-15-series-battery-capacity-wattage-support-revealed-by-chinese-regulatory-database/">MySmartPrice</a></em> has obtained this information from a Chinese regulatory database.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-lineup-store.jpg" alt="" width="2976" height="1538" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911377" /><br/>
The Chinese regulatory listing reveals that the iPhone 15 has a 3,349mAh battery (rated capacity) and a wattage of 12.981Wh, while the iPhone 15 Pro has a 3,274mAh battery and a wattage of 12.70Wh.<br/>
<br/>
Battery capacities for the full iPhone 15 lineup:<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 15: 3,349mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Plus: 4,383mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro: 3,274mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 4,422mAh</li></ul><br/>
Battery capacities for the 2022 iPhone 14 lineup:<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 14: 3,279 mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro: 3,200 mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro Max: 4,323 mAh</li></ul><br/>
The same database accurately revealed battery capacities for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/11/iphone-14-battery-capacities-mah/">all four iPhone 14 models</a> ahead of those devices launching last year. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the incremental increases shown above, Apple did not highlight any battery life improvements for its new iPhone 15 models compared to their direct predecessors, presumably because any difference is negligible in real-world usage. This comes contrary to a multitude of rumors prior to Apple's event, which suggested that the major efficiency improvements of the A17 Pro chip would bring battery life improvements.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, the approximate battery life of each of iPhone 15 model is as follows:<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 15: 20 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Plus: 26 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro: 23 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 29 hours</li><br/>
</ul>This is exactly the same as the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro Max, and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Of course, it's possible that efficiency improvements may still result in slightly better real-world performance in Apple's latest models, but we won't know until third-party tests are available.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models were announced by Apple earlier this week and will be available to pre-order on Friday. The devices are set to launch on September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-battery-capacities-revealed/">iPhone 15 Battery Capacities Revealed in Regulatory Database</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-battery-capacities-revealed-in-regulatory-database.2401911/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple said on Friday it would issue a software update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> users in France to address <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/france-orders-end-to-iphone-12-sales-radiation/">radiation concerns</a> raised by the country's regulators (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-implement-iphone-12-update-next-few-days-france-minister-2023-09-15/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iphone-12-preorder-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1213" height="682" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-794852" /><blockquote>"We will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators. We look forward to iPhone 12 continuing to be available in France," Apple said in a statement.<br/>
<br/>
"This is related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators and not a safety concern," added the company.</blockquote>The French regulator ANFR said it would test the software update. If it made a difference to the electromagnetic waves the device emitted, the regulator said it would bring the model into compliance with European standards applied in France, and the marketing withdrawal order would be lifted.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, France <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/france-orders-end-to-iphone-12-sales-radiation/">ordered</a> Apple to halt &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; sales and "fix" existing devices to bring them into electromagnetic radiation compliance with European standards. The increase in emitted electromagnetic radiation observed over time by regulators appears to have been the result of successive software updates issued by Apple, and was not present when the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; was launched in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
The ANFR ordered Apple to "remove the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌ from the French market from September 12 due to the model exceeding the limit" for electromagnetic absorption by the body. The agency also told Apple to recall every ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌ it has ever sold in the country. Ministers later said that though the radiation level was above the accepted standard, it was not dangerous and people were safe to continue using the phones, local media reported. <br/>
<br/>
Following the controversy, Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-14/apple-tech-support-staff-urged-to-stay-mum-on-iphone-12-radiation-issue">reportedly</a> advised its tech-support staff not to volunteer any information when consumers ask about the issue, and tell any concerned customers that that all Apple products go through rigorous testing to ensure that they're safe, according to guidance.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/france/">France</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-iphone-12-software-update-france-radiation/">Apple to Issue iPhone 12 Software Update in France to Address Radiation Concerns</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-issue-iphone-12-software-update-in-france-to-address-radiation-concerns.2401857/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_JEezynhrc">shared an ad</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, exclusively highlighting the new titanium finish of the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_JEezynhrc?si=Umn0q-DK-7Tep0T-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The 38-second spot depicts a titanium fragment exploding into view and torpedoing through the Solar System towards the surface of the Earth. "From the edge of the universe... to the palm of your hand," reads the ad's tagline.<br/>
<blockquote>Might meets light. Introducing the new titanium iPhone 15 Pro. Featuring a whole new level of gaming performance with the A17 Pro chip. A more versatile, more advanced Pro camera system. And an aerospace-grade titanium design. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are our lightest, most powerful Pro models ever.</blockquote>For the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max, Apple is using a new titanium frame rather than a stainless steel frame, which cuts down on weight. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max, yet the chassis is more durable.<br/>
<br/>
The use of titanium on the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ also brings with it a change to the chassis finish. Previously, all Pro iPhones used heavily polished stainless steel with a mirror finish as the chassis material. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ has a brushed finish that is considerably less reflective than the finish of previous Pro iPhones, and is also less prone to fingerprints.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;‌ Plus continue to feature a chassis made from aluminum. Pre-orders for all &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models begin on Friday, September 15, with in-store availability beginning a week later on September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ads/">Ads</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-showcases-iphone-15-pros-titanium-ad/">Apple Showcases iPhone 15 Pro&#039;s Titanium Chassis in New Ad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-showcases-iphone-15-pros-titanium-chassis-in-new-ad.2401845/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
Customers in the United States <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pre-order-setup/">can still "Get Ready"</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; launch with a pre-order setup process that allows them to select an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, confirm it with a carrier, and enter a payment method and shipping address.<br/>
<br/>
Those hoping to get a device on launch day should pre-order right away, as we do not yet know what the available supplies will look like. Popular &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models often sell out quickly, so we could see the new colors disappear within a matter of minutes to hours.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models starts at &#36;799, while pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models starts at &#36;999. Many U.S. carriers are offering discounts, and Apple is offering the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Upgrade Program and trade-in options to drop the price.<br/>
<br/>
After pre-orders on September 15, the first &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; orders will arrive to customers on Friday, September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/iphone-15-preorder-times/">Here&#039;s When You Can Pre-Order the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max in Every Time Zone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-when-you-can-pre-order-the-iphone-15-iphone-15-plus-iphone-15-pro-and-iphone-15-pro-max-in-every-time-zone.2401798/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/apple-releases-ios-16-6-1/">launch of iOS 16.6.1</a> on September 7, Apple has stopped signing iOS 16.6, the previously available version of iOS. Now that iOS 16.6 is no longer being signed, it is not possible to downgrade to that version of iOS after upgrading to iOS 16.6.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iOS-16.6-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892299" /><br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases come out to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date, so it is not unusual that the iOS 16.6 update is no longer being signed.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 16.6.1 is an update that addresses a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/ios-16-6-1-macos-13-5-2-active-vulnerabilities/">zero-day security vulnerability</a> that Apple says was actively exploited in the wild.

		<description><![CDATA[Blackmagic Design today <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagiccamera">announced the launch of Blackmagic Camera</a>, a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> app that integrates with Blackmagic Cloud and uploads content directly to the DaVinci Resolve video editing app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/blackmagic-camera-ios.jpg" alt="" width="2007" height="1129" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911286" /><br/>
The app features the same digital film camera controls and image processing functions that are available with Blackmagic Design's cameras. The company says that users can create YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram content with a "Hollywood" cinematic look and feel.<br/>
<br/>
All settings are adjustable, including frame rate, shutter angle, audio levels, tint, shutter speed, lens, white balance, and ISO, with a simple tap-based interface. The interface includes record parameters, histogram, focus peaking, levels, and frame guides, and it can be brought up with a swipe. Focusing can be done by tapping on the screen, and there are options for shooting in 16:9 or vertical aspect ratios.<br/>
<br/>
4K ProRes video can be recorded directly to Blackmagic Cloud and synced directly into DaVinci Resolve. Cloud integration allows video footage to be sent to a post production studio in a matter of minutes for simpler editing, and it is available to all members of a project.<br/>
<br/>
Video can also be recorded to the phone's storage and then exported to an external drive for those who prefer not to use Blackmagic Cloud, or uploaded manually to Blackmagic Cloud. Footage from multiple iPhones can be sent to DaVinci Resolve and lined up using the software's Sync Bin tool.<br/>
<br/>
More information on the Blackmagic Camera app for iOS can be <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagiccamera">found on the Blackmagic website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Blackmagic Camera is free to use and can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> as of today. [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241">Direct Link</a>]<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has done some internal shuffling and appointed Tim Millet, vice president of platform architecture, to lead the team that is working on blood glucose monitoring functionality for the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>

According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-14/apple-taps-new-chief-for-team-developing-watch-s-glucose-tracker">Bloomberg</a></em>, Millet is now in charge of the Exploratory Design Group or XDG that has been developing noninvasive blood glucose testing for years. The team was previously led by longtime Apple employee Bill Athas, but he unexpectedly died in late 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Millet has been at Apple for almost 20 years, and he reports to Apple chip chief Johny Srouji. <em>Bloomberg</em> says that Millet has played a key role in the transition to Apple silicon, leading several teams that work on the processors.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's work on blood glucose monitoring is being overseen by the semiconductor team rather than a health team because it requires advanced sensors and chips. Apple is exploring a noninvasive monitoring technique that involves shooting a laser underneath the skin to determine the concentration of glucose in the blood.<br/>
<br/>
Noninvasive blood glucose monitoring would allow diabetics to test their blood glucose levels without needing to prick the skin, plus it would likely be able to detect pre-diabetes and other blood glucose issues.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Apple reached a milestone "proof-of-concept" stage with hardware that is about the size of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but Apple needs to condense the components into a size that can fit into an Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
A blood glucose monitoring function for the Apple Watch remains several years away.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/apple-watch-blood-glucose-team-update/">Apple Watch Blood Glucose Team Gains New Lead</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-blood-glucose-team-gains-new-lead.2401766/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will begin accepting pre-orders for the new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max this Friday, September 15 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time. As usual, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-pro/">Pro models</a> have a long list of new features, including a USB-C port, lightweight titanium frame, customizable Action button, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Below, we have highlighted 12 new features on the iPhone 15 Pro models:<br/>
<ul><li>Lightning has been replaced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-pro/">with a <strong>USB-C port</strong></a> for a more universal charging standard and faster data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps.</li><br/>
<li>All four iPhone 15 models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/all-iphone-15-models-support-displayport/"><strong>support DisplayPort</strong></a> for up to 4K HDR video mirroring and video output to an external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable, according to Apple's tech specs for the devices.</li><br/>
<li>A new <strong>titanium frame</strong> results in the iPhone 15 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/titanium-iphone-15-pro-weight/">weighing up to 10% less</a> than the iPhone 14 Pro models with a stainless steel frame.</li><br/>
<li>A customizable <strong>Action button</strong> replaces the traditional mute switch on previous iPhones. By default, the button is set to toggle between Ring and Silent modes, but it can also be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-action-button-everything-it-can-do/">assigned to a different action</a> for quick access to the camera, flashlight, Voice Memos, Shortcuts, Focus modes, and more.</li><br/>
<li>The new <strong>A17 Pro chip</strong> enables <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/iphone-15-pro-geekbench-scores/">up to 10% faster CPU performance</a> and up to 20% faster GPU performance compared to the A16 Bionic chip.</li><br/>
<li>The devices are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/iphone-15-pro-features-specs-rumors/">equipped with <strong>8GB of RAM</strong></a>, up from 6GB in the iPhone 14 Pro models. Along with the new A17 Pro chip, extra RAM benefits overall system performance, particularly for multitasking.</li><br/>
<li>There are <strong>thinner bezels</strong> around the screen compared to the iPhone 14 Pro models.</li><br/>
<li>Like the latest Macs and iPad Pro, the iPhone 15 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-models-wi-fi-6e/">support <strong>Wi-Fi 6E</strong></a> (6GHz) for faster wireless speeds and less signal interference. Remember, you'll need a Wi-Fi 6E router in order to take advantage of this functionality.</li><br/>
<li>The iPhone 15 Pro Max exclusively features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/"><strong>up to 5x optical zoom</strong></a>.</li><br/>
<li>The devices are equipped with a <strong>second-generation Ultra Wideband chip</strong>. Apple says two iPhones with this chip can connect from 3x farther away.</li><br/>
<li>The devices feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/iphone-15-pro-models-more-repairable/"><strong>more repairable internal design</strong></a>, with a redesigned frame that allows for the back glass panel to be easily removed from the devices. This change was first made to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus last year.</li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/new-iphone-15-pro-color-options-no-gold/"><strong>New colors</strong></a>: Natural Titanium, Blue Titanium, White Titanium, and Black Titanium.</li></ul>For more details about the devices, read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro roundup</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/iphone-15-pro-pre-orders-tomorrow/">iPhone 15 Pro Available to Order Tomorrow With These 12 New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-available-to-order-tomorrow-with-these-12-new-features.2401761/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The earbuds are &#36;19 on Apple's online store.<br/>
<br/>

Apple now sells three versions of EarPods, including ones with a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTJY3AM/A/earpods-usb-c">USB-C connector</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-lightning-connector">Lightning connector</a>, and a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-35mm-headphone-plug">3.5mm headphone plug</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Released in 2012, the EarPods have become far less popular since Apple launched wireless AirPods in 2016. Starting with the iPhone 12 series in 2020, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/iphone-12-ships-without-earpods-or-charger/">stopped including EarPods</a> and a charger in the box with new iPhones in order to be more environmentally friendly, a decision that was controversial at the time.<br/>

		<title>Apple Surveys Devs With Vision Pro About Digital &#039;Persona&#039;</title>

		<description><![CDATA[While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset is not launching until early 2024, some developers have access to the device in order to develop <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> apps. Through Feedback Assistant, Apple is collecting opinions on the Vision Pro "Persona" that is created for each person for use with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-facetime.jpg" alt="" width="2432" height="1368" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900260" /><br/>
The Persona is a digital representation of the user, with Apple using the headset's cameras to recreate the face and hands. While the &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; call is ongoing, the Persona is able to make the same facial expressions and hand movements as the user, so that &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; calls feel more like a person-to-person interaction.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/vision-pro-headset-survey.jpg" alt="" width="1074" height="1388" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911183" /><br/>
There is likely some degree of uncanny valley with this experience, so it is no surprise that it is a feature that Apple is working to refine. Apple is asking developers a number of questions about the Persona experience.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>How do you feel about your Persona?</li><br/>
 	<li>To what extent do you feel this Persona represents your appearance?</li><br/>
 	<li>To what extent do you feel your Persona responds to your facial expressions?</li><br/>
 	<li>What do you like most about your Persona?</li><br/>
 	<li>What do you like least about your Persona?</li><br/>
 	<li>What do you like/not like about this Persona?</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Respondents are given multiple choice answers for most of the questions, with the last one being an open feedback form. For the "How do you feel about your Persona?" question, for example, responses include "Very Happy - I'm excited to use it," "Happy - I would be okay using it," "Unhappy - I would be hesitant to use it," and "Very Unhappy - I would never use it."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: Apple is asking developers with the Vision Pro to fill out a feedback survey about FaceTime Personas.<br><br>Some questions include: <br><br>How do you feel about your Persona?<br><br>To what extent do you feel this Persona represents your appearance? <a href="https://t.co/wKgQlKrODL">pic.twitter.com/wKgQlKrODL</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1702364571053248573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple does not plan to release the Vision Pro headset until early 2024, so it still has several months of software refining and hardware tweaking to do before the device needs to be mass produced in order to sell.<br/>
<br/>
The headset will be priced at &#36;3,500 when it launches, and it will first be available in the United States before expanding to other countries.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/apple-vision-pro-developer-survey/">Apple Surveys Devs With Vision Pro About Digital &#039;Persona&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-surveys-devs-with-vision-pro-about-digital-persona.2401745/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple has made sharing files and media easier than ever, thanks to a cool new AirDrop proximity feature that does most of the work for you. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airdrop-videos-ios-17.jpg" alt="" width="2484" height="1391" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900711" /><br/>
In prior versions of iOS, transferring a file or photo between Apple devices involves opening the file in question, tapping the Share button, selecting AirDrop, then choosing the nearby device you want to send the file to.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, this procedure still exists for sharing between Apple devices, but if you're transferring between iPhones then you can cut out some of the typical sharing steps by using AirDrop's new proximity feature.<br/>
<br/>
To initiate a transfer, select the photo or file that you want to share with someone. From there, simply bring your unlocked ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>‌ next to the other person's unlocked ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and your device will pop up a share interface without you having to tap on the Share Sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Tap the Share button that pops up to send the photo or file to the person next to you, and it will be received on the other device automatically, with permission granted through their proximity.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airdrop-proximity-sharing.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1327" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905665" /><br/>
<br/>
Note that sharing files this way works even if AirDrop receiving is turned off or limited to contacts, so it offers a way to share a file with someone without having to change your overall AirDrop settings. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Enable or Disable AirDrop Proximity Sharing</h3><br/>
We're used to AirDrop working with someone in the same room and involving a few manual steps, but the proximity sharing feature makes transfers between two devices virtually effortless. Of course, if you don't like the idea of proximity sharing, you can turn it off. Here's how it's done in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>Tap through to <strong>General -> AirDrop</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle the switch next to <strong>Bringing Devices Together </strong>on or off.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/enable-disable-airdrop-proximity-sharing.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911172" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. Note that disabling this setting will also prevent the sharing of contacts via NameDrop.

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> replaces the first-generation model that was introduced last year in Apple's smartwatch lineup, but how different are the two successive smartwatch generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-vs-Ultra-2-Buyers-Guide.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911116" /><br/>
In 2023, Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Ultra, introducing a more durable design and titanium casing, a larger and brighter display, additional speakers and microphones, considerably longer battery life, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-8-vs-apple-watch-ultra/">more</a>. The first-generation Apple Watch Ultra has now been discontinued by Apple, and as a year-old model, prices at third-party resellers are falling. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to upgrade to a first- or second-generation Ultra‌.<br/>
<br/>
The two Apple Watch Ultra models share the overwhelming majority of their features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the first-generation to save money? This breakdown also serves as a way to see all the differences that the Ultra 2 brings to the table.<br/>

Overall, the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; is a very minor upgrade over the first-generation model, with the S9 chip, Double Tap, and Precision Finding for &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models being the most significant changes. As a result, it is very difficult to recommend upgrading.<br/>
<br/>
Most users of the existing Apple Watch Ultra will not be able to justify upgrading to the Ultra 2, but some customers coming from an older Apple Watch or those who do not have one at all could still have good reason to prefer the latest model, namely those who heavily use a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, plan to buy an &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model and can take advantage of Precision Finding, need additional storage for downloaded media, or think one-handed use with the Double Tap gesture would be useful.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; is very similar to the first-generation model, so most customers who are interested in buying an Ultra model may prefer to look for a discounted first-generation model. If the original device can be found for a substantially lower price, it remains a solid buy. The Ultra 2 is priced at &#36;799, so if you are not interested in its new features and can find the original model for less than ~&#36;650, it may be worth getting that instead.<div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-ultra-vs-ultra-2/">Apple Watch Ultra vs. Ultra 2 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 12 Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-vs-ultra-2-buyers-guide-12-differences-compared.2401719/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
