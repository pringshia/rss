		<description><![CDATA[Apple this morning <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">announced</a> new models of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air, now with the M3 chip. With Apple moving onto the next generation of MacBook Air models, we're looking back at the original 13-inch M1 MacBook Air, which is at a great all-time low price on Best Buy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/M1-MacBook-Air-Deals-Feature-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2125" height="1195" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850533" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the 256GB 13-inch M1 MacBook Air for <a href="https://howl.me/clLm50orOos"><strong>&#36;749.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;999.99. Best Buy has this notebook in all three colors, and offers free two-day shipping to all customers. Although nearly four years old, this version of the MacBook Air still has an Apple silicon chip and should be perfect for anyone who wants to prioritize saving money over having the latest and greatest product.<br/>
<br/>

With the launch of the new MacBook Air models, this M1 device from late 2020 has now been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-discontinues-m1-macbook-air/">discontinued</a> from Apple's official lineup. Additionally, Apple has discontinued the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air, so we'll likely be tracking last-chance deals on those notebooks soon.

		<title>All-New Apple Watch Hermès &#039;Tricot&#039; Knitted Band Released</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple and Hermès today released an all-new knitted "Tricot" Apple Watch band, available in four color options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Hermès-Tricot-Single-Tour-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939425" /><br/>
Apple describes the Tricot Single Tour as "a knitted textile band that comfortably hugs the wrist like a glove." It is available as a single tour band only.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Patterned on 1930s-era Hermès gloves created for driving, sailing, and golf, the Tricot band takes what was old and makes it new again. The continuous textile knit comfortably hugs the wrist, imparting both a freedom of movement and a sense of élan.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Hermès already sells a number of "Tricot" luxury accessories such as neckties. Unlike its main selection Tricot accessories, which tend to be made of 100% silk, the Apple Watch Hermès Tricot Single Tour is made of polyamide yarn. Polyamide is waterproof and enables the band to be used when swimming, just like all of the other non-leather Apple Watch Hermès bands.<br/>
<br/>
The Tricot Single Tour band is available in Bleu Jean, Jaune de Naples, Orange, and Beige de Weimar. It is only compatible with 38mm, 40mm, and 41mm Apple Watch models. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/hermes-tricot.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939444" /><br/>
<br/>
The Tricot Single Tour replaces the both the single and double tour Apple Watch Hermès Bridon bands on the company's main Apple Watch band webpage. The Apple Watch Hermès Bridon bands are knitted just like the Tricot, suggesting that the new band could replace it when stock runs out.<br/>
<br/>
The Bridon band is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTHQ3AM/A/apple-watch-hermès-45mm-noir-bridon-single-tour?">still available</a>, but it may only be while stocks last as a result. Apple tends to allow discontinued Apple Watch Hermès bands to sell out over a longer period of time rather than outright de-listing them. The Navy/Gris/Ciel Bridon band also continues to be available directly from Hermès, but now on a separate webpage, just like many of the leather Apple Watch Hermès bands that Apple stopped selling in September last year.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-refreshes-cases-and-watch-bands/">refresh of iPhone and Apple Watch band color options</a> earlier today, Apple and Hermès added Bleu Céleste/Écru and Framboise/Écru Color options to the Hermès Toile H Single Tour band, Bleu Céleste/Bleu Jean and Jaune d'Or/Bleu Jean color options to the Hermès Twill Jump Single Tour and, and Blanc and Bleu Céleste color options to the Hermès Kilim Single Tour band.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Hermès Tricot Single Tour band is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP93AM/A/apple-watch-hermès-41mm-orange-tricot-single-tour?fnode=2f8bb64ea4e2bafcdc01e949ab01260e2f27c6d3f637fe18cb1f10a46f8c1b133a041375d7e3ed4eef9ead783a04a78fa7cfd974ffb9147f87779a78f3a3bc24c30e2a1f4f3c5d29b2f5ee07827b36fb">now available to order</a> for &#36;349.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-hermes/">Apple Watch Hermès</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-watch-hermes-tricot-released/">All-New Apple Watch Hermès &#039;Tricot&#039; Knitted Band Released</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-new-apple-watch-hermès-tricot-knitted-band-released.2421011/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>M3 MacBook Air Supports More External Displays Than M3 MacBook Pro</title>

		<description><![CDATA[If you frequently work with external displays, it's worth noting that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">just-announced</a> M3 MacBook Air models support two external displays – one more than the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the same M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-2-up-hero-240304-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939443" /><br/>
Launched last October, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip simultaneously supports one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz. <br/>
<br/>
In contrast, both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip support one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz, and two external displays with up to 5K resolution at 60Hz when the laptop lid is closed, also known as clamshell mode.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the machines use identical chips, it could be that the additional external display support on the MacBook Airs has been made at the software level. If so, there would seem to be no reason that it could not be added to the M3 MacBook Pro in a future software update. However, it could also be a hardware-based change, and we might not know for sure until a teardown is performed on the new laptops.<br/>
<br/>
The new M3-powered MacBook Air models start from &#36;1,099 and can be pre-ordered on Apple's website, with availability beginning on Friday, March 8. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip starts at &#36;1,599.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-more-external-displays/">M3 MacBook Air Supports More External Displays Than M3 MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-macbook-air-supports-more-external-displays-than-m3-macbook-pro.2421010/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The previous generation MacBook Air models with M2 chip, the 13-inch model of which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m2-macbook-air-under-1000/">Apple still sells</a>, only officially offer support for one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz. <br/>
<br/>
By contrast, the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models support one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz with the laptop lid open, and two external displays with up to 5K resolution at 60Hz with the lid closed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">announced</a> the two new MacBook Air models today. Pre-orders are now open on Apple's website, with the laptops set to launch on Friday, March 8.

		<description><![CDATA[The European Commission today <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1161">fined Apple</a> €1.8 billion (&#36;1.95 billion) for anti-competitive conduct against rival music streaming services. In a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/?1709553731">response</a> published on its website, Apple fiercely attacked the Commission's decision, as well as Spotify's behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
The fine comes as the conclusion to a long-running investigation by the EU, triggered by a complaint from Spotify, into Apple's treatment of third-party music streaming services on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. The Commission now says that Apple abused its dominant position in the market by forbidding music streaming apps to tell users about cheaper subscription prices outside the app.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The European Commission has fined Apple over €1.8 billion for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps to iPhone and iPad users ('iOS users') through its App Store. In particular, the Commission found that Apple applied restrictions on app developers preventing them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app ('anti-steering provisions'). This is illegal under EU antitrust rules.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
In an extensive public <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/?1709553731">response</a>, Apple noted that while Spotify has a dominant, 56 percent share of Europe's music streaming market and a "large part of their success is due to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;," the company does not pay anything to Apple because it refuses to sell subscriptions in its app. Apple listed a large number of services that it provides to Spotify for free, such as distribution, APIs, frameworks, TestFlight, App Review, and in-person engineering assistance. "But free isn't enough for Spotify," Apple says. "They also want to rewrite the rules of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; — in a way that advantages them even more."<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Instead, Spotify wants to bend the rules in their favor by embedding subscription prices in their app without using the App Store's In-App Purchase system. They want to use Apple's tools and technologies, distribute on the App Store, and benefit from the trust we’ve built with users — and to pay Apple nothing for it.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Apple said that Spotify claimed in 2015 when it started working on the investigation with the European Commission that the "digital music market had stalled, and that Apple was holding competitors back." "Unfortunately for their case, Spotify continued to grow," Apple added.<br/>
<br/>
Apple noted that three different related cases mounted against it by the European Commission over the past eight years consistently found no evidence of consumer harm and no evidence of anti-competitive behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The reality is that European consumers have more choices than ever. Ironically, in the name of competition, today's decision just cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is the digital music market's runaway leader.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Apple also said that it is set to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) within days, alluding to the release of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">iOS 17.4</a>, which includes a number of significant changes for users in Europe to meet the legislation's requirements. It believes that today's fine is "an effort by the Commission to enforce the DMA before the DMA becomes law," since it is "not grounded in existing competition law." Apple plans to appeal the decision.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">EU Fines Apple &#36;2 Billion for Anti-Competitive Behavior Toward Spotify</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-fines-apple-2-billion-for-anti-competitive-behavior-toward-spotify.2420990/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple likely plans to launch a new accessory this week rather than a major product, with stores currently planning for only a minor refresh, predicts <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1764475865029837212?s=20"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-pencil-2-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939083" /><br/>
The prediction follows a rumor we reported on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/source-apple-product-announcements-this-week/">over the weekend</a> that Apple plans to announce new products with press releases on its website this week. <br/>
<br/>
Apple stores are actually planning a larger refresh early next week that is more likely to be related to once of the larger rumored announcements, according to Gurman. These include new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models with OLED displays, two new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, and new 13-inch and 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
Rumored accessories that we could see before then include at least one new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, and new color options for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> cases and Apple Watch bands. A new Magic Keyboard for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with a larger trackpad is also said to be imminent, but Apple is unlikely to launch this prior to new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models being announced.<br/>
<br/>
One other outlying possibility is a new color option for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, although this has not been rumored and is only based on the timing of previous colorway releases. Also, a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; color is a major product, not an accessory.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A few additional points: retail stores are low on MacBook Airs and iPad Pros; Stores are planning a minor refresh for this week (I think it&#39;s a new accessory rather than a new product); Stores are planning a larger refresh early next week (which sounds more product-related). <a href="https://t.co/kUkeYjT4rK">https://t.co/kUkeYjT4rK</a></p>&mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1764475865029837212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple remains committed to microLED, despite suggestions that its project to bring the display technology to Apple Watch Ultra has been ditched, according to reports out of Taiwan and Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-866346" /><br/>
Last week, Apple supplier arms OSRAM <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled-for-now/">announced</a> that a "cornerstone project" was "unexpectedly cancelled." Counterpoint Research's Display Supply Chain Consultants informed <em>MacRumors</em> that this project related to the rumored Apple Watch with a microLED display. <br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo later weighed in on the matter, saying that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/kuo-says-microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled/">canceled</a> the project for the "foreseeable future." <br/>
<br/>
Pushing back against this narrative, <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240304PD200/apple-ai-micro-led-osram.html">DigiTimes</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20240304000298">ETNews</a></em> report that Apple still has multiple internal teams dedicated to microLED projects and is actively seeking alternative suppliers. "The OSRAM LED chip may have been replaced due to a drop in performance, and Apple may have already found a replacement for Taiwan or China, which is ahead in the microLED field," said <em>ETNews</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Taiwan's AU Optronics (AUO) and PlayNitride are said to be among the prospective frontrunners to fulfill Apple's production needs, according to <em>DigiTimes</em>. AUO has just begun mass production of microLED watch display panels, while PayNitride is mass producing related chips. <br/>
<br/>
Talks between Apple and PlayNitride have reportedly faltered due to scale limitations, but AUO has apparently emerged as a "promising partner" with its advancements in microLED display applications.<br/>
<br/>
The reports align with comments made by <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240301-12054.html">TrendForce</a>, which previously said that Taiwan and South Korea have a "robust lineup of manufacturers for Micro LED chips, backplanes, and related transfer processes."<br/>
<br/>
Kuo last week claimed that microLED production costs are currently "too high" for its Apple Watch Ultra project to be "economically viable." But according to industry sources cited by <em>DigiTimes</em>, the high costs of early microLED production remain within expectations.<br/>
<br/>
"Based on Apple's track record in development, high expenses tied to pioneering technologies are typically manageable and can be addressed as long as production scales up," said the report. "However, the primary challenge persists in overcoming associated technological bottlenecks." <br/>
<br/>
These bottlenecks are said to include an absence of circuit control design within the LEDs, which potentially increases the risk of LED chip damage. "Furthermore, the stamp technology solution falls short in achieving precise transfer, particularly when interfacing with Osram's vertical chips," according to <em>DigiTimes</em>.<br/>
<br/>
The main takeaway from today's reports is that Apple likely still hopes to eventually transition to microLED in the future, but the Apple Watch Ultra may not necessarily be the first product to adopt the technology. According to a separate report today by <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=26333">The Elec</a></em>, Apple may instead decide to prioritize microLED technology for future, lighter versions of Apple Vision Pro while it waits for watch implementation costs to come down.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-still-dedicated-microled-apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Still Plans MicroLED Apple Watch Ultra, Seeks New Suppliers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-plans-microled-apple-watch-ultra-seeks-new-suppliers.2420987/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to announce new products with press releases on its website this week, a proven source familiar with the matter told <em>MacRumors</em>. While the products that Apple plans to announce have not been disclosed, there are rumors about new iPads, Macs, and accessories. It is unclear exactly what will be announced this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Logo-Spotlight.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912758" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today reiterated that Apple is planning new iPad Pro, iPad Air, and MacBook Air models, along with new Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories for select iPads. Gurman believes that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">Apple is not planning to hold a traditional event</a> to unveil these products, and instead plans to announce them "on its website" and with a "series of online videos and marketing campaigns" at some point in March or April.<br/>
<br/>
The following announcements are expected in this March-April window:<ul><li>Two new iPad Pro models with the M3 chip, OLED displays, a thinner enclosure, a landscape-oriented front camera, a redesigned rear camera bump and other design tweaks, and possibly MagSafe wireless charging</li><br/>
<li>Two new iPad Air models with the M2 chip, including a first-ever 12.9-inch model</li><br/>
<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro with a larger trackpad, a partially-aluminum enclosure, and other design tweaks</li><br/>
<li>At least one new Apple Pencil</li><br/>
<li>New 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip, and the laptops will likely gain support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3</li><br/>
<li>A new color option for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus has not been definitively rumored, but it is likely based on precedent</li><br/>
<li>New color options for iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands</li></ul>There have also been rumors about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">a new Apple TV</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">HomePod with a screen</a> launching in the first half of 2024, but it is unclear if these products are ready. There are also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/iphone-se-4-design-revealed-in-cad-renders/">alleged CADs for a fourth-generation iPhone SE</a>, but it is likewise unclear if that device is imminent, as 2025 has been a more widely rumored timeframe for it.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The rumored design of the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> was today corroborated in a series of CAD renders shared by Indian tech blog <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-apple-iphone-se-4-cad-renders-new-design/"><em>91Mobiles</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-SE-4-render.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="675" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939241" /><br/>
The images show a 6.1-inch, all-screen design display with a notch housing the TrueDepth camera array for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, flat sides, and a USB-C port in place of Lightning. This design would be a substantial upgrade over the current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, which features curved edges, a 4.7-inch display, a Home Button with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, and large bezels.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-SE-4-front-render.jpg" alt="" width="1068" height="529" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939243" /><br/>
The new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is apparently 147mm tall, 71.5mm wide, and 7.7mm thick. This is almost identical to the size of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, which is 146.7mm tall, 71.5mm wide, and 7.8mm thick.<br/>
<br/>

Overall, the images corroborate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/"><em>MacRumors</em>' reporting from last year</a>, which revealed that the next-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; would largely re-use the design of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, including &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; authentication and a 6.1-inch OLED display, but with a single rear camera, an Action button, and a USB-C port. The device is expected to launch next year.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple does not plan to hold a traditional event to unveil new iPads and Macs, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-03/why-was-apple-car-canceled-the-hubris-in-apple-thinking-it-could-outdo-tesla-ltbke5ut"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Instead, he said Apple plans to announce the products on its website with a "series of online videos and marketing campaigns."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
If this plan is accurate, we can expect the new products to be announced with press releases on the Apple Newsroom website.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman expects Apple to announce the following products:<ul><li>Two new iPad Pro models with the M3 chip and OLED displays</li><br/>
<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro</li><br/>
<li>Two new iPad Air models, including a first-ever 12.9-inch model</li><br/>
<li>At least one new Apple Pencil</li><br/>
<li>New 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip</li></ul>The new iPad Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">expected to be thinner</a>, and they are rumored to be equipped with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a> like the iPad 10.<br/>
<br/>
March or April are also common months for Apple to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-15-productred-possibility/">new iPhone color</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-watch-bands-spring-colors/">new colors for iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of timing, Gurman said that Apple is planning to release a "special version" of iOS 17.4 with support for the new hardware at the end of March, leading him to expect the devices to "arrive sometime in March or April." Presumably, there would also be special iPadOS 17.4 and macOS 14.4 versions preinstalled on the new iPads and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major changes to the App Store and more</a> in the EU, as a result of the Digital Markets Act. Apple has until March 6 to comply with the Digital Markets Act, in order to avoid fines, so the common belief has been that iOS 17.4 will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/ios-17-4-release-date/">likely be released by then</a>. The special version would follow later in the month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">Gurman: No Apple Event Planned for Upcoming iPads and Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-apple-event-planned-for-upcoming-ipads-and-macs.2420928/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's former hardware engineering chief Dan Riccio told colleagues he is "nearing retirement" after more than 25 years at the company, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-03/why-was-apple-car-canceled-the-hubris-in-apple-thinking-it-could-outdo-tesla-ltbke5ut"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Dan-Riccio.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939201" /><br/>
John Ternus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/25/dan-riccio-transitioning-new-project/">succeeded</a> Riccio as Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering in 2021. That year, Apple said Riccio would "transition to a new role focusing on a new project," which Gurman said was the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple described Riccio when it announced that transition in 2021:<blockquote>Riccio has been a leader in designing, developing, and engineering almost all of Apple's products. From the first generation iMac to the more recent 5G iPhone lineup, M1-based Macs, and AirPods Max, Riccio built the Hardware Engineering teams and scaled Apple's ability to innovate across multiple new product lines with the highest quality. After joining Apple in 1998 as a leader on the Product Design team, Riccio became vice president of iPad Hardware Engineering in 2010, and in 2012 he joined the executive team as the leader of Hardware Engineering.</blockquote>Here is what Riccio said in that press release:<blockquote>Working at Apple has been the opportunity of a lifetime, spent making the world's best products with the most talented people you could imagine. After 23 years of leading our Product Design or Hardware Engineering teams — culminating with our biggest and most ambitious product year ever — it's the right time for a change. Next up, I'm looking forward to doing what I love most — focusing all my time and energy at Apple on creating something new and wonderful that I couldn't be more excited about.</blockquote>Apple launched the Vision Pro in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-launch-day/">in early February</a>, and it said the headset will be released in additional countries later this year.<br/>
<br/>
There is no timeframe for Riccio's retirement, as Gurman said specific details related to his planned departure are still being worked out.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dan-riccio/">Dan Riccio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/apples-dan-riccio-nearing-retirement-report/">Apple Executive Dan Riccio Reportedly &#039;Nearing Retirement&#039; Following Vision Pro Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-executive-dan-riccio-reportedly-nearing-retirement-following-vision-pro-launch.2420929/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Unlike the MacBook Air deals, Best Buy's MacBook Pro sales all require a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership in order to see the all-time low prices. If you don't have one, you can still get solid second-best prices on these computers at Best Buy this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
These deals are focused on the 16-inch models of the MacBook Pro. Some highlights include the M3 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro (512GB, 18GB RAM) for &#36;2,249.00 and the M3 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro (512GB, 36GB RAM) for &#36;2,649.00, both of which are &#36;250 off and all-time low prices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple shocked the world this week by canceling its long-running electric vehicle project into which it invested billions of dollars over the past decade. Rumors indicated the project had been struggling for years, but to see it officially end up on the chopping block is still quite startling.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/top-stories-2mar2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939143" /><br/>
Other news and rumors this week included the pending release of iOS 17.4 and the significant changes for EU users that come along with it, rumors about device support for iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 later this year, and more, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Cancels Electric Car Project</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">reportedly canceled its long-rumored electric vehicle project</a> after years of setbacks. The report said that some employees on the team will shift to working on generative AI, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">expected to be a tentpole feature of iOS 18</a>, while others may be laid off.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774148" /><br/>
Following the news, we shared a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-car-history/">detailed recap of the Apple Car's history</a> dating back to the project's inception around 2014, including some of the challenges faced. Dan and Hartley also discussed the developments in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/the-macrumors-show-rip-apple-car/">this week's episode of <em>The MacRumors Show</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.4 is Coming Soon: Here's Apple's Full Release Notes</h2><br/>
iOS 17.4 includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">several changes to the App Store</a>, Safari, and more in the EU, as a result of new regulations under the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932463" /><br/>
For a complete list of other new features and changes coming to the iPhone with iOS 17.4, read <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-release-candidate/">Apple's full release notes for the update</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release iOS 17.4 on or before March 6, the deadline for complying with the Digital Markets Act. In advance of the release, Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-whitepaper-alternative-app-marketplaces/">published a deep dive</a> into the steps it has taken to try to keep users safe among the changes, while Spotify, Epic Games, and others have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/spotify-epic-games-apple-dma-complaint/">protested that the changes do not comply</a> with the intent of the act.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 Rumored to Be Compatible With These iPhone Models</h2><br/>
A private X/Twitter account with a proven track record for iOS-related information this week shared alleged <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/will-your-iphone-support-ios-18/">iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 compatibility details</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-18-Roundup-Article.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924585" /><br/>
We have shared a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ios-18-compatible-iphones-rumor/">full list of iPhone models that are rumored to support iOS 18</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ipados-18-compatible-ipads-rumor/">full list of iPad models that are rumored to support iPadOS 18</a>. Both software updates are expected to be unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Expands Do-It-Yourself Repair Program to M3 Macs</h2><br/>
Apple this week expanded its self-service repair program in the U.S. and Europe <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/apple-self-service-repair-m3-macs/">to support M3 Macs</a>, including the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and iMac variously equipped with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-self-service-macbook-1600.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939134" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/apple-self-service-repair-m3-macs/">Parts, tools, and manuals are now available</a> from Apple for customers who wish to attempt repairing these Macs, but Apple of course still recommends that most customers visit an Apple Store or other authorized repair shop.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>HomePod With 'iPad-Like Display' Rumored to Launch in 2025 at Earliest</h2><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/">still working on a new HomePod speaker with an "iPad-like display,"</a> but the device is unlikely to launch until 2025 at the earliest, according to the latest word from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" /><em>Concept rendering</em></div><br/>
Gurman reiterated that Apple has also explored a device that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/18/apple-work-on-apple-tv-homepod-continues/">combines an Apple TV, HomePod, and FaceTime camera</a>, along with iPad-like smart displays that could be magnetically attached to a wall in a house.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Not-So-FineWoven iPhone Case 'Browning Like a Rotten Banana'</h2><br/>
Apple last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">stopped selling leather accessories</a>, including iPhone cases. Instead, it introduced a new fabric material called FineWoven.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/finewoven-case-stern.jpeg" alt="" width="3000" height="1999" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938281" /><br/>
Unfortunately for Apple, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/finewoven-iphone-cases-brown-like-rotten-banana/">FineWoven cases for iPhones have received lots of criticism</a>, with many customers complaining about quality issues after extended usage. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern said her case is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/finewoven-iphone-cases-brown-like-rotten-banana/">"browning like a rotten banana"</a> after just five months.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Goldman Sachs today increased the Apple Card savings account's balance limit to &#36;1 million, with cardholders being notified by email.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-card-savings-account-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928948" /><br/>
From the updated <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Deposits-Account-Agreement.pdf">Apple Card cardholder agreement</a>, effective March 1:<blockquote>The maximum balance limit for your Account is &#36;1,000,000, based on your Current Balance (including interest and Daily Cash deposits).</blockquote>The account's previous balance limit was &#36;250,000, which is the maximum amount that the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would cover in the event that Goldman Sachs were to become insolvent. Any deposits above &#36;250,000, up to the new &#36;1 million limit, would not be covered by the FDIC in the event of bank failure.<br/>
<br/>
Some other high-yield savings accounts in the U.S. offer balance limits above &#36;250,000. For example, Goldman Sachs' other high-yield savings account Marcus allows a maximum balance of &#36;1 million per account, up to a total of &#36;3 million.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. Apple's savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-savings-account-apy-increase/">currently offers a 4.5% APY</a> following an increase in late January.<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs reportedly plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">end its partnership with Apple</a>, but it is unclear how this might impact the Apple Card and the savings account.<br/>
