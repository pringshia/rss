		<description><![CDATA[Following the Apple Card savings account's recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-card-savings-account-apr-increase/">rate increase to 4.35%</a>, we have put together this guide comparing the annual percentage yields (APYs) of some popular high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) available to U.S. residents.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-card-savings-account-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928948" /><br/>
Apple's rate now matches that of popular HYSAs offered by the likes of American Express, Capital One, and Discover, but there are a handful of other options that offer even higher APYs in the 4.5% to low 5% range, such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Wealthfront. Balance limits and other requirements vary.<br/>
<br/>
There are many other HYSAs not listed in our chart, so be sure to do your research before deciding which option is best suited for you.<br/>

<div class="clear"></div>* Advertised APYs as of January 5, 2024. APYs may vary.<br/>
<br/>
Ordinary savings accounts at popular banks such as Bank of America and Chase typically offer APYs of only 0.01% or slightly higher.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed is &#36;250,000, which is lower than some HYSAs, and balances are fully insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs will reportedly be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">ending its partnership with Apple</a> within the next year or so, but it is unclear how this might impact the Apple Card.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/05/apple-card-savings-rate-comparison-hysas/">Here&#039;s How the Apple Card&#039;s New Savings Rate Compares to Alternatives</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-how-the-apple-cards-new-savings-rate-compares-to-alternatives.2415537/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> will meet the European Union's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, next week amid a series of disputes with the organization (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-vestager-meet-big-tech-ceos-us-next-week-2024-01-05/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/10/tim-cook-europe-privacy.jpg" alt="" width="712" height="394" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-662071" /><br/>
Vestager is also set to meet the chief executives of Alphabet, Broadcom, and Nvidia, as well as senior executives from OpenAI. The meetings will take place in San Francisco and Palo Alto on Thursday and Friday next week, and will focus on European competition policy and digital regulation.<br/>
<br/>
In December, Apple reportedly floated the ability for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> rivals to access the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s NFC technology for contactless payments in the EU. The offer is designed to settle an ongoing antitrust dispute and avoid a potential fine. The European Commission is believed to be seeking feedback from rivals and customers before accepting the offer, so it is highly likely that this matter will be discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also facing several other challenges in the EU that will almost certainly be the subject of discussion, such as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/apple-could-pay-ireland-eu-tax-dispute/">&#36;14 billion tax dispute</a>. Most strikingly, new EU rules such as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) designate major tech companies as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">gatekeepers</a>" and compel them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will be reopening its <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/baystreet/">Bay Street retail store</a> in Emeryville, California on Monday, January 8 at 10 a.m. local time, according to the company's website.<br/>
<br/>

The store had been closed for renovations since early September, according to <a href="https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/p/clearing-the-table"><em>Tabletops</em></a>, a weekly newsletter about Apple retail published by <a href="https://departmentmap.store/">Michael Steeber</a>. However, it is currently unclear if the store will have any public-facing changes when it reopens, or if the renovations are limited to the backroom area for staff members.<br/>
<br/>
The store originally opened in 2002, becoming Apple's 50th retail location in the U.S., and moved to its current location on Bay Street in 2016.<br/>
<br/>
Steeber recently released a major update for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facades/id6443868157">Facades</a>, an app that provides comprehensive information about Apple's retail stores around the world. Users can now explore the history and grand opening of any store, track multiple store visits, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[A new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> model with the M3 Ultra chip—which could be more powerful than expected—will launch in mid-2024, according to a new report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Pro-and-Studio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920519" /><br/>
The report comes from Taiwanese research firm <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/01/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-attracts-influx-of-3nm-customers-predicts-production-capacity-utilization-to-surge-to-80-by-year-end/">TrendForce</a> citing <a href="https://www.icsmart.cn/72181/"><em>ICsmart</em></a>. The current &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, which contains <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Max and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip options, was introduced at WWDC in June 2023. With TrendForce forecasting another mid-year update for the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, a repeat appearance at WWDC seems likely this year.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> is the only other Mac model that contains an "Ultra" Apple silicon chip, so its absence from today's report discussing the M3 Ultra is noticeable. While, logically, the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; should receive an update to add the M3 Ultra chip alongside the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, just like it received the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip last year, there have been no rumors to suggest this will be the case again this year as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, TrendForce claims that the M3 Ultra chip will be fabricated with TSMC's N3E node, just like the A18 chip that is expected to debut in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup later in the year. This means it would be Apple's first N3E chip. The M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips are fabricated with TSMC's N3B process, just like the A17 Pro. N3E is an enhanced version of TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process, offering slightly better performance and higher production yield. <br/>
<br/>
It would be somewhat odd for Apple to make the M3 Ultra its first N3E chip, since Apple's "Ultra" chips comprise two "Max" chips linked via its UltraFusion chip interconnect technology, meaning that an N3E M3 Ultra would effectively be two M4 Max chips. To date, each generation of Apple's custom silicon chips have used the same fabrication process across the lineup, since the chip architecture is simply scaled up. Using different nodes in the same family of chips, especially on the "Ultra" chip variant, would be an unprecedented move.<br/>
<br/>
The only explanation if Apple does opt for this route would be that the company plans to introduce the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips sooner rather than later, perhaps in late 2024, and would want to ensure that the M3 Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; remains competitive with the newer chips. Even so, in this instance, it would surely be more straightforward to brand the chip "M4 Ultra" and skip the M3 Ultra entirely. <br/>
<br/>
As a result, this part of the report should be treated with some skepticism. Nevertheless, a mid-year time frame for the launch of a new &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; seems likely. <br/>

		<title>Apple Card Savings Account Receives Another Rate Increase</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today increased the Apple Card savings account's APY to 4.35%, according to a notification sent to cardholders, including <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892213" /><br/>
This is the second increase to the savings account's APY in as many months, after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/apple-savings-4-25-interest-rate/">raised it from 4.15% to 4.25% in December</a>. Apple's rate now matches that offered by popular high-yield savings accounts from American Express and Discover, but there are still some other options that offer even higher APYs up into the 4.5% to low 5% range in the U.S., such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Wealthfront.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the high-yield savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/4.35-Apple-Card-Savings.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928919" /><br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on personal funds deposited via a linked bank account, or from their Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed is &#36;250,000, and balances are fully insured by the U.S. government's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.<br/>
<br/>
The rate increase comes after <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in November reported that Goldman Sachs is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">looking to terminate its Apple Card partnership</a>, as part of its broader exit from the consumer lending business. The partnership is expected to end within the next year or so, but it's unclear how this might affect the Apple Card in the future.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-card-savings-account-apr-increase/">Apple Card Savings Account Receives Another Rate Increase</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-account-receives-another-rate-increase.2415503/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BlackBerry fans that miss having a physical keyboard on their smartphones may want to <a href="https://www.clicks.tech">check out Clicks</a>, a company that has developed a keyboard case that's designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clicks-keyboard-for-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928870" /><br/>
Clicks is showing off its keyboard accessories ahead of CES, and the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro version of its keyboard will be ready to ship out in February. The keyboard is priced at &#36;139, with an &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; version coming in mid-March and a &#36;159 &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max version set to release in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
The Clicks Creator Keyboard is available in "BumbleBee" yellow and "London Sky" gray, and it adds a small physical keyboard to the bottom of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Clicks says that the case design is meant to "feel like a natural extension" of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and the keys have been designed for ideal click resistance and feedback for fast and accurate typing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clicks-keyboard-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928871" /><br/>
The standard QWERTY keyboard features keys for activating dictation, accessing emoji, and activating shortcuts like returning to the Home screen and scrolling. At night, a built-in backlight can be turned on.<br/>
<br/>
An &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; connects to the keyboard via Lightning (&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro) or USB-C (&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;), and passthrough charging is supported. The case also supports wireless charging capabilities, though it does not have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; version of the Clicks keyboard measures in at 188.45mm, so it is 41.85mm longer than the 146.6mm &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. That is equivalent to 1.65 inches, so expect an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; equipped with this keyboard to be over an inch and a half longer. It's a little over 3mm wider than the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and 2.50mm thicker. The case weighs in at 62 grams, a little under half of the 187 gram weight of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clicks-keyboard-gray-color.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928872" /><br/>
Dimensions are similar for the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max models, so the keyboards do add some considerable bulk to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Clicks says that the keyboard is easy to put on and remove, and while in use, it does serve as a hardware-based keyboard, so you won't see the software keyboard on the display.<br/>
<br/>
Clicks for &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.clicks.tech">can be pre-ordered from the Clicks website</a>, while the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max version can be reserved for &#36;30.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/clicks-iphone-keyboard/">Miss Physical Keyboards?

		<description><![CDATA[<em>MacRumors</em> recently received new information on Apple's 2024 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup, including a look at prototypes of the Pro devices. We've created a series of mockups based on Apple's internal designs, and while the prototypes are not quite finalized, our images represent the clearest look yet of what we can expect from the next-generation iPhones at this point in time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Perspective-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928694" /><br/>
<br/>
Building on the curved edges and titanium frame that Apple introduced with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max are set to feature increased display sizes and a new capacitive Capture button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928695" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-16-preliminary-weights-dimensions/">As reported by multiple sources</a>, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; (codename Diablo) and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max (codename Lightning) will have larger displays, measuring in at 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches, up from 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches. One possible explanation for this change has to do with the 5x tetraprism Telephoto camera, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/tetraprism-lens-iphone-16-pro/">which is expected to be available on both Pro iPhone models this year</a>. With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, only the larger &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max includes the 5x Telephoto lens, while the smaller &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; does not. The increased size of this year's devices will give Apple the space to add the tetraprism Telephoto camera to both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and 16 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
While the overall form factor and general design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max have remained consistent through Apple's development phase, the company has experimented with different design details for the devices. There were four total button configurations that were tested, and Apple appears to have settled on a button design similar to the one on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, though with an added button on the right side of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Left-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928696" /><br/>
As with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, both Pro models in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> range will be equipped with a multi-purpose Action button. The button can be configured to perform a range of functions, depending on the user's preference. While Apple has experimented with larger sizes and different designs for the Action button, current design documentation suggests that the Action button will be the same size as the one found on the current &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">An earlier Action button design</a>, developed under the codename Atlas, was envisioned as a larger capacitive button with a force sensor. Given that the most recent designs for the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max do not feature this bigger Action button, the future of the Atlas project remains unclear, and it is possible that Apple canceled the Atlas project in favor of a standard mechanical Action button.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/">Weibo leaker "Instant Digital" claimed</a> in October that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; would feature an Action button that lies flush with the frame of the device. Although internal documentation seen by <em>MacRumors</em> corroborates this claim, it was a feature of the earlier "Proto1" development stage. With the current "Proto2" design that we've seen, the Action button is no longer flush with the frame, and is no longer as large.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Right-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928697" /><br/>
On the right side, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models feature an all-new Capture button, which we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/early-iphone-16-prototypes/">showed off in our December renders</a> of the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models. The Capture button, developed under the codename Nova, is expected to be a capacitive-type button with force-sensor functionality, and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> recently confirmed that it will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/">used for taking video</a>. It is located below the power button, which means that on U.S. models, Apple is relocating the mmWave antenna from the right side of the device to the left side. The Capture button will be flush with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s frame and it will not protrude like the power and volume buttons.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of materials, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will continue to use the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/iphone-15-pro-grade-5-titanium/">Grade 5 Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) used for the iPhone 15 Pro</a>, with no significant changes to the overall finish. As far as colors are concerned, Apple's prototypes use a "Silver" color, which is marketed by Apple as "White Titanium." Documentation suggests that Apple has so far used the existing colors from the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max for testing purposes, with plans to add another color option. Unfortunately, there are no details on the new color option at this time.<br/>
<br/>
While the mockups we've created accurately portray the current design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, changes are always possible as the devices are still in an early stage of development and Apple may make further design tweaks. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the past few months, some users have been unable to sync their Apple Music library between their iPhone and Mac, seemingly due to a bug.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iOS-17-Apple-Music-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907547" /><br/>
Affected users receive the following error message in the Music app on the Mac:<blockquote>Genius results can't be updated right now. An unknown error occurred (18004).</blockquote>There are complaints about the issue across the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255233822?sortBy=best">Apple Support Community</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-library-no-longer-works.2415038/">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/18yacfb/apple_music_library_is_completely_broken/">Reddit</a>, and elsewhere on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
The underlying cause of the issue is unclear, and it's not entirely clear if a fix will require software updates, or if Apple can implement a server-side fix. We've reached out to Apple for comment, and we'll update this story if we receive a response.<br/>
<br/>
This issue comes after another Apple Music bug related to playlists <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-music-playlist-bug-fixed/">was fixed</a> last month.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-music-library-syncing-issue-18004/">Some Apple Music Subscribers Experiencing Library Syncing Issue Across the iPhone and Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-apple-music-subscribers-experiencing-library-syncing-issue-across-the-iphone-and-mac.2415466/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second public beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.3 update, allowing non-developers to test out the software ahead of its release. The second public beta comes three weeks after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-1/">the first public beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 includes support for collaborative playlists in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, allowing &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscribers to build playlists with others. When creating a new playlist or selecting an existing playlist, there's a person-shaped icon that can be tapped to turn on collaboration.<br/>
<br/>
Enabling collaboration provides a link that can be shared with others, and anyone with the link is able to contribute to the playlist and listen to the songs. The person who started the playlist can choose to approve those who want to join or open it up to everyone. Anyone with the link to a playlist can add music, though the owner can turn off collaboration at any time or remove people.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 is expected to see a launch at some point in January 2024. Apple has also released public betas of watchOS 10.3 and new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 17.3 software. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-2/">Apple Seeds Second Public Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-public-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-3.2415463/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last night stopped signing the iOS 17.2 update, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS going forward. iOS 17.2 is no longer being signed following the December 19 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/apple-releases-ios-17-2-1/">release of iOS 17.2.1</a>, an update that brought bug fixes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918854" /><br/>
It is not unusual that iOS 17.2 is no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; operating system.<br/>
<br/>
The iOS 17.2 update brought the Journal app, spatial video recording on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, updates to Messages and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, and more. Apple did not ever provide details on the bug fixes included in iOS 17.2.1.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-beta-features/">already testing iOS 17.3</a>, an update that is expected to come out later in January.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-2/">Apple Stops Signing iOS 17.2, Downgrading No Longer Possible</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-2-downgrading-no-longer-possible.2415462/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung this week announced its 2024 Unpacked event, which is set to be held on January 17 in San Jose, California. Samsung is expected to introduce its S24 line of Galaxy smartphones, which will directly compete with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="[Invitation] Galaxy Unpacked 2024: Opening a New Era of Mobile AI" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wRAwejsqW6A" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Samsung's event announcement teases a "new era of mobile AI," so it's safe to say that Samsung's new smartphones will have enhanced AI capabilities on par with ChatGPT and other AI products. In fact, Samsung says that the new Galaxy S series will feature the "most intelligent mobile experience yet."<br/>
<br/>
Galaxy S24 rumors have suggested that the high-end Ultra model will include a 200-megapixel <a href="https://twitter.com/universeice/status/1736910942318084347">AI-enhanced camera</a> that is able to identify 12 kinds of objects and optimize them for improved image quality. The AI could also be used to translate messages to more than a dozen languages in real time.<br/>
<br/>
The S24 Ultra is also expected to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984653/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-plus-leaks-rumors-snapdragon-ai">feature a flatter screen design</a> with a more square shape, and it appears that Samsung is going to transition to a titanium frame, mimicking an Apple design decision for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. Samsung is expected to offer the S24 Ultra in black, gray, violet, and yellow titanium shades.<br/>
<br/>
Other Ultra rumors include a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto lens, which is a downgrade from the prior 10x telephoto lens, and Wi-Fi 7 support. The S24 and S24 Plus are expected to be largely similar to the S23 models, though there will be new color options and lager 6.7 and 6.2-inch displays.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's event will take place on January 17 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, and customers who plan to pre-order <a href="https://howl.me/cllVxphW5r6">can reserve a device</a> and receive a &#36;50 Samsung credit. The reservation system does not charge automatically, requiring only a name and an email address to reserve devices. Credits will be able to be redeemed when pre-ordering after the devices debut.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It's been a few months since Apple accessory maker Pad & Quill <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/pad-quill-shutting-down/">announced</a> the closure of its business, ending a 13 year run as a creator of leather accessories for Apple products. This week, former Pad & Quill president Brian Holmes has announced his new venture, <a href="https://burtongoods.com?sca_ref=5180275.Ywgd2BL872">Burton Goods</a>, and it has a 20 percent off grand opening discount.<br/>

<br/>
Holmes detailed everything that happened from the closure of Pad & Quill to the founding of Burton Goods <a href="https://burtongoods.com/blogs/news/what-happened-to-pq">in a blog post</a>. Burton Goods will follow in Pad & Quill's footsteps in many ways, focusing on high-quality leather accessories for iPhone and iPad, leather bags for tech enthusiasts, and more.<br/>

<br/>
In regards to the grand opening sale, Burton Goods is offering a 20 percent discount sitewide for the entire month of January. This sale will be applied in your cart and does not require a coupon code. It's also specifically a pre-order discount, as Burton Goods' first wave of products doesn't launch until the first week of February.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the most common New Year's resolutions is to exercise more, and Apple Fitness+ will be adding more content next week to help out.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Fitness-Plus-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928774" /><br/>
Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-fitness-plus-offers-more-ways-to-stay-active-and-mindful-in-the-new-year/">announced</a> that Fitness+ will be gaining a variety of new workouts, meditations, and "Time to Walk" audio episodes starting January 8.<br/>
<br/>
The following new workouts will be available:<ul><li>Starting January 8, 10 new workouts with music by Rihanna will be available.</li><br/>
<li>Starting January 15, new workouts with music by Britney Spears will be available.</li><br/>
<li>Starting January 22, new workouts with music by U2 will be available.</li><br/>
<li>Starting February 5, Artist Spotlight workouts will feature music by Usher, who will be headlining this year's Apple Music Halftime Show at Super Bowl LVIII.</li></ul>Seven new "Sound" meditations coming to Fitness+ will allow you to relax with a variety of "soothing tones and rhythms." Apple is also adding a new workout program called "Strength, Core, and Yoga for Golfers," which it says is designed to improve strength, balance, flexibility, and mobility for golfers of all skill levels.<br/>
<br/>
Similar to podcasts, "Time to Walk" episodes feature influential people sharing stories and music that users can listen to while walking. Upcoming episodes will feature new guests, including Al Roker, Trixie Mattel, Lilly Singh, Common, and Colman Domingo. For the first time ever, select episodes will be available on Apple Podcasts for free in the 21 countries where Fitness+ is available, even without a subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch users can earn a new limited-edition award <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/apple-watch-new-year-2024-challenge/">called "Ring in the New Year"</a> when they close all three Activity rings for seven days in a row any time in January.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing to preview a new version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> with generative AI and a range of new capabilities at WWDC, according to a post on the Korean social media site Naver from a user with a track record for posting Apple rumors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/siri-symbol-iphone-feature.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="481" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-927705" /><br/>
According to developer sources speaking to the operator of tech news <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostList.naver?blogId=yeux1122&tab=1">aggregator account "yeux1122"</a> on Naver, Apple has recently made progress with integrating generative AI into &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; using its Ajax-based model that <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-experimenting-with-chatgpt-tool/">first mentioned</a> in July. The new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; apparently touts natural conversation capabilities, as well as increased user personalization.<br/>
<br/>
The new features are believed to be available across devices, suggesting that the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will retain conversation information from one device to another. It is also said to feature a new "Apple-specific creational service," which might relate to the previously reported Siri-based <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">Shortcuts capabilities</a> rumored for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is purportedly working on linkages for the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to connect to various external services, likely via an API. Finally, the report suggests that some of Apple's new AI features may differ based on subscription service status, but it is unclear what shape this could take.<br/>
<br/>
A recent forecast from Deepwater Asset Management <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-could-acquire-peloton-this-year/">similarly claimed</a> that Apple will bring generative AI to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; this year. The Naver blog account has a mixed track record for forecasting Apple's plans, but some of its claims have proven to be significant. For example, in March 2022 it accurately revealed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/iphone-se-rumor-magsafe-battery-life/">some details</a> about the third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> ahead of Apple launching the model. In October of the same year it also accurately predicted that Apple would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/30/14-16-macbook-pro-next-year/">delay the release</a> of new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models until early 2023.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/new-version-of-siri-with-generative-ai/">New Version of Siri With Generative AI Again Rumored for WWDC</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-version-of-siri-with-generative-ai-again-rumored-for-wwdc.2415432/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models will be the first to feature more than one 48-megapixel sensor, leaving the Telephoto as the only rear-facing camera with a 12-megapixel resolution, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> reports. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/12/iphone-11-pro-ultra-wide.jpg" alt="" width="2264" height="1186" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-722975" /><br/>
Writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/玉晶光為高階鏡頭升級週期再起的關鍵贏家-iphone-17前相機升級-iphone-16-pro潛望鏡與超廣角-vision-pro-與華為p70超廣角-genius-is-a-key-7f125f60d783">Medium</a>, Kuo explained that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s Ultra Wide camera will feature a 48-megapixel sensor. The upgrade should allow the camera to capture more light, resulting in enhanced photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models already have a 48-megapixel Main camera that uses "pixel binning" to merge data from four pixels on the sensor into one "super pixel" for improved low-light capture. With the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models, this technology is expected to expand to the Ultra Wide lens, which is currently a 12-megapixel lens.<br/>
<br/>
This also means that &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models should be able to shoot <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-14-pro-take-48-megapixel-proraw-photos/">48-megapixel ProRAW photos</a> in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, International Securities analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">claimed</a> that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; will feature a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera. Just a few months later, further details about Apple's plan for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/iphone-16-pro-rumored-to-feature-48mp-ultra-wide/">new Ultra Wide camera</a> emerged on Chinese social media site Weibo. With Kuo now throwing his weight behind the rumor, the upgrade seems highly likely.<br/>
<br/>
In 2025, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 Pro is expected to complete the rear camera array's transition to 48-megapixel sensors, bringing the technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/">to the Telephoto lens</a>. Kuo added that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is on-track to feature the tetraprism Telephoto camera introduced on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. He also said that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 lineup will feature an upgraded front-camera camera unit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">with a 24-megapixel sensor</a> and a six-element lens.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/iphone-16-pros-ultra-wide-camera-major-upgrade/">iPhone 16 Pro&#039;s Ultra Wide Camera Rumored to Receive Major Upgrade</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pros-ultra-wide-camera-rumored-to-receive-major-upgrade.2415420/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Could Acquire Peloton This Year, Fund Manager Forecast Suggests</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will likely acquire the fitness company Peloton this year, a new hedge fund manager forecast claims.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/peloton-tv-workout-cardio.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-776133" /><br/>
Deepwater Asset Management's <a href="https://deepwatermgmt.com/deepwaters-2024-predictions/">annual forecast</a> for 2024 (via <em><a href="https://connectthewatts.com/2024/01/03/deepwater-predicts-apple-acquisition-of-peloton/">Connect the Watts</a></em>) says that Apple is likely to acquire Peloton sometime this year. The move would help Apple bolster its Fitness+ subscription service, adding workout equipment to compliment the Apple Watch and its existing activity tracking software. Absorbing Peloton's subscriber base of three-million users would ostensibly add about &#36;1.7 billion to Apple's subscription revenue and line up with its continued investment in health and wellness, the company claims.<br/>
<br/>
In 2022, Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/21/apple-floated-as-potential-buyer-of-peloton/">repeatedly floated</a> as a potential buyer of Peloton amid <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/07/peloton-now-in-trouble-thanks-to-apple-fitness/">financial difficulties and threats to its business model</a>, but the company's prospects have since improved somewhat and Deepwater Asset Management's new forecast is the first serious mention of the possibility in some time. Major questions remain about why Apple would want to take responsibility for Peloton's fragile business model and not simply focus on growing Fitness+, but anything is possible.<br/>
<br/>
Deepwater Asset Management also believes that Apple will bring generative AI to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> this year, introducing the revamped assistant at WWDC. The hedge fund manager is also not expecting Apple to announce any additional Vision Pro products this year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peloton/">Peloton</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fitness-plus/">Apple Fitness Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-could-acquire-peloton-this-year/">Apple Could Acquire Peloton This Year, Fund Manager Forecast Suggests</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-could-acquire-peloton-this-year-fund-manager-forecast-suggests.2415419/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/dynamic-island.jpeg" alt="" width="1244" height="706" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-889703" /><br/>
The information was shared in a new <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/玉晶光為高階鏡頭升級週期再起的關鍵贏家-iphone-17前相機升級-iphone-16-pro潛望鏡與超廣角-vision-pro-與華為p70超廣角-genius-is-a-key-7f125f60d783">post on Medium</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. With the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17, Apple will apparently bolster the hardware to a 24-megapixel camera with a six-element lens. Kuo says that the upgrade will significantly improve the image quality of the front-facing camera.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 6S</strong>: 5-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture and 4P lens</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 7, iPhone X, and iPhone XS</strong>: 7-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture and 4P lens</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 11, iPhone 12, and iPhone 13</strong>: 12-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/2.2 aperture and 5P lens</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16</strong>: 12-megapixel front-facing camera with ƒ/1.9 aperture, autofocus, and 5P lens</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 17</strong>: 24-megapixel front-facing camera with autofocus and 6P lens</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels is noteworthy because it would allow for greater detail and clarity in images. With a higher resolution, photos can maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, providing more flexibility in post-processing. Additionally, the larger number of pixels can capture finer details, making the images sharper and more vibrant.<br/>
<br/>
The upgrade to a six-element lens would also slightly enhance image quality. Each element can be designed to correct for various aberrations and distortions, leading to clearer, more accurate photos. The additional elements can also improve the efficiency of light transmission to the sensor, enhancing low-light performance.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">expected</a> to be the first ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ to feature under-panel <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> technology, which could reduce the size of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, but a circular cutout for the front-facing camera is expected to remain. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro will probably be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple is then <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-under-display-camera/">expected</a> adopt under-display cameras in 2027's "Pro" ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ models for a true "all-screen" appearance.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">Kuo: iPhone 17 to Feature 24MP Front-Facing Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera.2415409/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
