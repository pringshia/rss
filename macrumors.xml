		<description><![CDATA[Astropad today announced a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> app called <a href="https://astropad.com/slate/">Astropad Slate</a>, which can be used to control the Mac with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>. Astropad Slate is available as a public beta, and because it's still in testing, it is free for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/astropad-slate-ipad.jpg" alt="" width="1999" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916747" /><br/>
There are several Mac functions that can be performed with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. It works as a cursor for controlling the desktop mouse, with a tap on the screen serving as a click. Handwriting done on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will be translated into typed text on the Mac. Astropad Slate supports the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover gestures on newer iPads, and there is a simulated hover option on older iPads, plus you can use two-finger touch gestures for actions like scrolling and zoom.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/872784238?h=548327e593" width="560" height="364" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
You can also use the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as a pen tablet with Mac apps that support drawing, sketching, and other creative work. The Astropad Slate app basically turns the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; into a no-screen drawing tablet so you can focus on your work on the Mac. A Mac and an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can be connected using Wi-Fi, Peer-to-Peer networking, or an appropriate USB cable. Requirements include iPadOS 15 or later and macOS 11 or later.<br/>
<br/>
The Astropad Slate app can be accessed by signing up for the beta <a href="https://astropad.com/slate/">on the Astropad website</a>. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Lighting company <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/">Nanoleaf</a> today announced the launch of new Essentials lights that are aimed at replacing some of the standard bulbs that are installed in ceilings, plus it is introducing a new series of products in partnership with Umbra.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/nanoleaf-downlight.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916707" /><br/>
The <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/essentials/bulbs/?category=GU10&amp;standard=matter&amp;size=3">Essentials Matter GU10</a> and the Essentials Matter Recessed Downlight are compatible with smart home platforms that support Matter, which includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>. The lights can be added to a &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; setup as long as a Matter hub like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> is available. The Essentials lights are also Thread enabled and will integrate with other Thread products for improved connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
Nanoleaf's Recessed Downlights are four inches in size and can replace standard downlights that you may have in your home, while the GU10 bulbs can replace light fixtures that use that bulb style. Like all Nanoleaf Essential lights, the Downlights and GU10 bulbs support 16 million colors as well as a range of different white temperatures.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/nanoleaf-gu10.jpg" alt="" width="3988" height="2243" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916708" /><br/>
The lights can be controlled through the Nanoleaf app or through the Home app when added to &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj;, and can be activated through automations to have lights turn on at specific times or work in tandem with other smart home devices. Multiple bulbs can be grouped together so you can change the lighting in entire rooms at one time.<br/>
<br/>
Nanoleaf today also announced that it is partnering with Umbra on two new Smart Lamps that are compatible with Matter. The Cono Portable Lamp and the Cup Lamp have unique designs created by Umbra with lighting technology supplied by Nanoleaf. The Cono and Cup Lamps work like other Nanoleaf lights, supporting millions of colors and working with scenes, automations, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/cono-lamp-nanoleaf.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916711" /><br/>
The Cono Portable Lamp has a built-in battery that lasts for up to five hours so it can be taken from room to room, while the Cup Lamp is a desktop lamp with a USB charging port and a cup base that is able to hold desk accessories.<br/>
<br/>

Three of the GU10 bulbs <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/essentials/bulbs/?category=GU10&amp;standard=matter&amp;size=3">can be preordered</a> for &#36;50, while the downlights are <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/ceiling-lights/downlight/?size=each">priced at &#36;35 each</a>. The <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/smarter-partners/umbra-lamps/?category=cono-lamp&amp;color=grey">Cono Portable Lamp</a> is available for preorder now and is priced at &#36;95, and the &#36;130 Cup Lamp will be available in early 2024.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nanoleaf/">Nanoleaf</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/nanoleaf-downlights-lamps/">Nanoleaf Debuts HomeKit-Compatible Downlights, GU10 Bulbs and Lamps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nanoleaf-debuts-homekit-compatible-downlights-gu10-bulbs-and-lamps.2407378/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated the public-facing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624">vintage and obsolete products list</a> on its website. The page confirms that all first-generation Apple Watch models are now obsolete, as we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/original-apple-watch-now-obsolete/">reported earlier this month</a> based on an internal memo. Obsolete products are no longer eligible for repairs or service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Watch-Series-1-Vintage-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1966" height="1106" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916758" /><br/>
Another addition to the page is the Apple Watch Series 1, which is now classified as vintage. Introduced alongside the Apple Watch Series 2 in September 2016, the Series 1 was a more affordable model that lacked the Series 2's built-in GPS, brighter display, and improved water resistance. It was also only available with an aluminum case, whereas the Series 2 had aluminum, stainless steel, and ceramic case options. In the U.S., the Series 1 started at &#36;269, compared to &#36;369 for the Series 2.<br/>
<br/>
Apple considers a product to be vintage once five years have passed since it was last distributed for sale. Apple discontinued the Series 1 in September 2018 after introducing the Apple Watch Series 4, so that five-year mark has now been reached. Vintage products are no longer guaranteed to be eligible for repairs at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, with service subject to parts availability.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, the Apple Watch SE is the budget model, with pricing starting at &#36;249.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/apple-watch-series-1-vintage/">Remember the Lower-Cost Apple Watch Series 1?

		<title>Apple Settles 7-Year Wi-Fi Chip Patent Dispute With Caltech</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple and its Wi-Fi chip supplier Broadcom have reached an agreement with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), putting an end to a years-long legal battle over wireless communication patents, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-caltech-lawsuit-idCAKBN31C1S5">Reuters</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-Wi-Fi-Chip-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-883034" /><br/>
The terms of the settlement have not been shared, but Caltech will be dropping its lawsuit against Apple and Broadcom with prejudice, preventing Caltech from refiling in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Caltech sued Apple and Broadcom <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/05/30/caltech-vs-apple-broadcom-wifi-lawsuit/">way back in 2016</a>, accusing the two companies of infringing on a series of Wi-Fi patents covering encoding and decoding circuitry for improving data transmission and performance. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Mac, and Apple Watch were all targeted in the suit for using Caltech technology.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/03/apple-countersues-caltech-settles-dot-23/">ended up countersuing</a> in an attempt to have the patents invalidated, a tactic that was unsuccessful. In 2020, a jury decided that Apple and Broadcom had indeed infringed on Caltech's patents, and Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/29/apple-caltech-patent-infringement/">ordered to pay &#36;838 million</a>, while Broadcom was told to pay &#36;270 million.<br/>
<br/>
The two companies combined were ordered to pay &#36;1.1 billion, which would have been one of the largest payouts in U.S. history for a patent dispute. Apple and Broadcom <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/04/apple-dispute-with-caltech-granted-new-trial/">appealed the decision</a>, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ultimately decided that while the two companies had infringed on Caltech patents, the damages award was not justified. The prior court had used a two-tier system to award damages based on different royalty rates, which the appeals court said was "legally unsupportable."<br/>
<br/>
A new trial was ordered, which would recalculate the amount that Apple and Broadcom would need to pay to Caltech. Rather than undergoing a second trial, Apple, Broadcom, and Caltech back in August told the court that a potential settlement was in the works, and now the settlement is official.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/broadcom/">Broadcom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/caltech/">Caltech</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/">Patent Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/apple-caltech-wi-fi-lawsuit-settlement/">Apple Settles 7-Year Wi-Fi Chip Patent Dispute With Caltech</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-settles-7-year-wi-fi-chip-patent-dispute-with-caltech.2407352/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be equipped with Qualcomm's latest cellular modem, according to technology analyst Jeff Pu, enabling faster and more power efficient 5G connectivity for the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913688" /><br/>
In a research note this week with investment firm Haitong International Securities, Pu said the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be equipped with <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/technology/modems/snapdragon-x75-5g-modem-rf-system">Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 modem</a>. However, he expects the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to retain the Snapdragon X70 modem used for the entire iPhone 15 lineup. Apple has typically used the same Qualcomm modem across all models for each generation of iPhones, excluding the low-end iPhone SE, so this would be a change in strategy for the company.<br/>
<br/>
Announced in February 2023, the Snapdragon X75 features improved carrier aggregation and other technology advancements for faster 5G download and upload speeds compared to the X70. The modem's combined mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G transceiver takes up 25% less circuit board space, and uses up to 20% less power, according <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23600171/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem-rf">to <em>The Verge</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Snapdragon X75 also supports the latest "5G Advanced" standard, which is described as "the next phase of 5G" and an "evolution towards 6G." 5G Advanced will include artificial intelligence and machine learning enhancements for improved 5G performance, and it will also expand 5G to additional types of devices and use cases.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is likely to market the iPhone 16 Pro models as featuring "5G Advanced," much like the iPhone 6s gained support for "LTE Advanced" in 2015.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to have been working on its own 5G modem for iPhones since 2018, but the project has reportedly faced development challenges, and the modem is not expected to be announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-modem-in-2025-kuo/">until 2025 or later</a> should it ever materialize. In the meantime, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/apple-extends-deal-with-qualcomm-as-modem-delayed/">extended its 5G modem agreement with Qualcomm</a> through 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Apple should announce the iPhone 16 lineup in September 2024, so there is still plenty of time remaining until the devices launch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-5g-advanced-rumor/">iPhone 16 Pro Expected to Support &#039;5G Advanced&#039; With Qualcomm&#039;s Snapdragon X75 Modem</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-expected-to-support-5g-advanced-with-qualcomms-snapdragon-x75-modem.2407339/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhones will not adopt resin coated copper (RCC) foil for their printed circuit boards until 2025, <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/最快需至2025年iphone主板才會採用rcc材料-it-will-take-until-2025-at-the-earliest-for-the-iphone-mainboard-to-61abc0d30883">according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo says that Apple will not adopt this technology in 2024 because of its "fragile characteristics" and "inability to pass drop tests."<br/>
<br/>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767478" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
If Apple and its supplier Ajinomoto can improve the RCC material before the third quarter of 2024, the high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 models could use it. Resin coated copper does not sound exciting, but it has the potential to slim down the size of circuit boards, freeing up space inside of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that can be used for larger batteries or other technology. Kuo says that it also makes the drilling process easier for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; manufacturing because RCC is fiberglass-free.<br/>
<br/>
Late last month, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-looking-to-save-space-with-thinner-pcbs/">Weibo circuit expert</a> claimed that Apple would adopt RCC for circuit boards starting in 2024, but it appears that we might not see the shift until 2025.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/rcc-thinner-circuit-boards-2025/">Kuo: iPhones Won&#039;t Adopt RCC for Thinner Circuit Boards Until 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphones-wont-adopt-rcc-for-thinner-circuit-boards-until-2025.2407338/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days event has ended, many of the week's best sales have expired. However, we're tracking a few Apple products that remain at their best-ever prices even after the end of the sale, including the AirPods 2, 15-inch MacBook Air, and 9th generation iPad.<br/>
<br/>

An overall highlight of Prime Day has been a &#36;250 discount across the entire 15-inch M2 MacBook Air lineup, and all of these sales are still around. The 256GB model is down to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75NSLJY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;1,049.00</strong></a> and the 512GB model is down to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C76D4RWJ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,249.00</strong></a>, and both are record low prices.<br/>

There were quite a few AirPods deals earlier in the week, but the only notable deal that has stuck around is on the AirPods 2. You can get these earbuds for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;89.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00, which is one of the lowest prices of the year and an overall second-bet price.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you're still shopping for the newest model of the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, there is a sale on this model, it's just not at its all-time low Prime Day price. You can pick up these earbuds for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00, which is still a good deal on the newest model of AirPods.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week published a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213680">support document</a> with some valuable tips for buying a preowned iPhone online or in person.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/iphoneseblack.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-737527" /><br/>
Apple starts off by touting that the iPhone "lasts longer than other smartphones," making a preowned iPhone a "great way to own an iPhone." Apple says it provides "industry-leading device support for software updates," although Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/software-support-pixel-8-pixel-8-pro/">recently announced</a> that its latest Pixel 8 phones will receive full Android updates for seven years, whereas iOS 17 only supports iPhone models released up to five years ago.<br/>
<br/>
When buying a preowned iPhone online, it is very important to choose a trusted seller, as the device cannot be physically inspected at the time of purchase. If possible, make sure the iPhone is not Activation Locked, as this would prevent you from using the device unless you know the previous owner's Apple ID and password.<br/>
<br/>
For in-person purchases, Apple shared a helpful checklist for inspecting a preowned iPhone. Apple explains how to check for damage, how to find out if parts have been replaced, how to view the battery's health, how to find out if the iPhone is locked to a carrier, how to ensure hardware like the camera and microphone are functional, and more.<br/>
<br/>
While some of the tips are obvious, Apple's support document might be worth bookmarking if you plan to buy a used iPhone in the future.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/apple-preowned-iphone-checklist/">Apple Shares Checklist With Important Tips for Buying a Used iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-checklist-with-important-tips-for-buying-a-used-iphone.2407322/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will release its first MacBooks based on TSMC's 3nm fabrication process in 2024, not this year as some rumors have suggested. That's according to a new five-year global notebook shipments forecast published by <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231011VL209/digitimes-research-2023-notebook-shipments.html">DigiTimes</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/m3-feature-black.jpg" alt="" width="1810" height="1018" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-827879" /><br/>
Predicting an end to a two-year decline in the notebook market, the report forecasts a 4.7% shipment growth in 2024 driven by the easing of inflation and the introduction of new products, including new MacBooks powered by 3nm-based chips. From the report:<br/>
<blockquote>In 2023, the share of notebooks built using Arm-based processors will likely decrease rather than increase because Apple, which adopts in-house designed Arm-based CPUs for most of its notebook lineups, is expected to experience a significant decline in shipments in 2023 as the US brand vendor plans to transit to CPUs built by a 3nm node at TSMC for performance upgrading in 2024.</blockquote>In July, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said October of this year could see the announcement of the first Macs with the M3 chip. Given that Apple launched new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models in January, and more recently new 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, ‌Mac Studio‌, and ‌Mac Pro‌ models in June, Gurman said the first beneficiaries of the new M3 chip would likely be the next ‌iMac‌, 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, and 13-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
However, more recently in September, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">said</a> that it seemed Apple will not launch new MacBook models with M3 series chips before the end of this year. Kuo only ruled out new MacBooks though, which appears to leave open the possibility of a new iMac coming this year. The current model featuring the M1 chip has now been on sale for over two and a half years.<br/>
<br/>
<em>DigiTimes</em> itself recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/new-14-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-2023/">suggested</a> Apple would make a MacBook Pro announcement before the holidays. The Taiwan-based outlet earlier this month claimed Apple is preparing to ship new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with more power-efficient mini-LED displays before the year is out. That report did not mention the processor the models would be based on, but Gurman has previously said the next version of these two machines will feature M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, and that they will "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">probably</a>" launch by the middle of 2024 at the latest. <br/>

The as-yet-unannounced M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated with TSMC's 3nm process for performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the current 5nm-based ‌M2‌ chip, which debuted in June 2022. It will also likely feature an all new GPU with hardware ray-tracing, first introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro's A17 Pro chip last month.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/apple-first-m3-macbooks-in-2024/">Apple&#039;s First M3 MacBooks Coming Next Year, Claims Shipment Forecast</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-m3-macbooks-coming-next-year-claims-shipment-forecast.2407293/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There appears to be a curious phenomenon that is causing some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models to turn off temporarily at night, which can interrupt alarms and other &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-passcode-green.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886806" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/175dic1/2_different_iphones_alarms_didnt_go_off_this/">thread on Reddit</a>, a user complains that two separate &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; alarms in his home failed to go off. Several other users also chimed in with similar issues, and it turns out that some of the issues could be linked to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; turning off at night. From Reddit:<blockquote>Hijacking top comment. Check your battery settings and see if there is a gap during the night. Yesterday a lot of iPhones turned off for a few hours during the night. In my case the phone turned back on 1 minute before the alarm</blockquote>Some other people noted having to put in their passcodes in the morning, an indication that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; restarted or shut off during the night. <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/10/iphone-restart-overnight/">9to5Mac</a></em> highlighted these issues earlier this week, and we've also experienced the problem here at <em>MacRumors</em>, as have <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphones-spontaneously-rebooted-last-night.2407082/">multiple users on the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>. From <em>MacRumors</em>:<blockquote>So my iPhone 15 Pro Max with iOS 17.0.3 spontaneously rebooted last night (10. October around 01:00 AM CET). The same happened to 3 of my friends with the same iPhone and same iOS, and to someone else with an iPhone 13 Mini, also on the same iOS.</blockquote>You can tell if your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; turned off at night by opening up the Settings app, navigating to Battery, and checking the charging status over the past 24 hours. If there's a gap, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was turned off for a period of time.<br/>
<br/>
The problem affects <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, but it is also impacting other devices, suggesting that it's something in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. Not all users are experiencing the shutdown issues, nor does it appear to be happening every night.<br/>
<br/>
It is not yet clear what is going on, and Apple has not commented.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/iphone-models-turning-off-at-night/">Some iPhone Models Mysteriously Shutting Off at Night</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-iphone-models-mysteriously-shutting-off-at-night.2407266/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[California this week officially adopted new right to repair legislation, with California Governor Gavin Newsom this week <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/10/10/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-10-10-23/">signing SB 244 into law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895789" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Self-Service-Repair-Program-iPhone.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
The Right to Repair law requires companies to provide customers with the tools to diagnose and repair consumer electronics and appliances. Apple in August sent a letter urging California to adopt the bill, despite the fact that Apple has lobbied against other Right to Repair legislation.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already launched a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/">Self Service Repair program</a> for iPhones and Macs, with the repair program providing customers with repair kits, repair manuals, and components for repairs. Apple also has repair programs for independent repair shops, such as the Apple Authorized Service Provider option and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/29/apple-independent-repair-program/">Independent Repair Provider program</a>.<br/>
<br/>
California's law requires service and repair facilities that are not authorized repair providers to disclose whether they're using replacement parts that are not from the device manufacturer, which would prevent Apple repair stores from using non-Apple parts without making that explicitly clear. As legitimate repair parts must come from Apple, the repair law in California is to Apple's benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Manufacturers are also not required to make tools, parts, and documentation available for any component that would disable or override antitheft security measures, which encompasses Apple features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Independent repair shops have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/06/apple-independent-repair-shops-contracts/">in the past complained</a> that Apple forces them to sign invasive contracts, and the kits that Apple sells for self-service repair are not much more affordable than simply getting a repair direct from Apple, but California's law does ensure that customers have options other than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
SB 244 requires that Apple and other companies provide components, repair manuals, and other repair information to be available for seven years after the sale of any product that costs more than &#36;99.99. It is applicable to products sold after July 1, 2021.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/california/">California</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/right-to-repair/">Right to Repair</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/california-right-to-repair-law/">Apple-Backed Right to Repair Bill Signed Into Law in California</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-backed-right-to-repair-bill-signed-into-law-in-california.2407256/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[T-Mobile will be forcing customers on older smartphone plans to move to newer, more expensive plans, according to information that has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174uelk/megathread_forced_plan_migration_for_older_plans/">shared on Reddit</a>. The migration will be automatic, but customers can contact support to ask to opt out of the migration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/t-mobile-logo-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893072" /><br/>
Those who had the prior Magenta and One plans will be upgraded to Go5G, while those on the Magenta 55+ plan will be upgraded to Go5G+. Simple Choice and Select Choice users will be moved to Magenta or Essentials Select.<br/>
<br/>
With these migrations to new plans, customers will see price increases of &#36;5 to &#36;10 per line depending on current plan. Those on the Simple/Select Choice plans, for example, will see a &#36;10 per line price increase.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who miss the notification about the upcoming plan changes can still ask to revert back for a short period, though customer service will attempt to push customers to new plans with one-time credits.<br/>
<br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://tmo.report/2023/10/breaking-t-mobile-will-force-customers-onto-newer-plans-unless-you-opt-out/">The Mobile Report</a></em>, customer support representatives will attempt to convince users about the benefits of the new plan. "We are not raising the price of any of your plans; we are moving you to a newer plan with more benefits at a different cost," T-Mobile instructs employees to say.<br/>
<br/>
Customers will begin receiving notifications about the upcoming plan changes on October 17, both through text messages and emails. Migration timing will vary based on bill cycle.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/t-mobile-plan-migration/">T-Mobile Automatically Upgrading Users to More Expensive Plans, But There&#039;s an Opt-Out Option</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-automatically-upgrading-users-to-more-expensive-plans-but-theres-an-opt-out-option.2407252/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Both Apple and Google came out with new high-end flagship smartphones this autumn, debuting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max and the Pixel 8 Pro, respectively. As with any expensive smartphone, the cameras in both produce amazing images, but there are some notable differences that can be seen in our comparison video and article.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RdKdQ_bMW4c" title="Camera Comparison: Google Pixel 8 Pro vs iPhone 15 Pro Max" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max has a triple-lens camera system with 48-megapixel Main (wide) camera that can be set to three focal lengths, a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and a 12-megapixel Telephoto lens that supports up to 5x optical zoom. The Pixel 8 Pro also has a triple-lens camera system with 50-megapixel Wide camera, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and a 48-megapixel Telephoto camera also with 5x optical zoom.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-3.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916454" /><br/>
The Google and Apple camera systems have similarities in available lenses and technologies like portrait mode, night mode, HDR, and more, but there are different software algorithms that are at work under the hood, and that's what brings in some of the biggest differences that we're seeing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-9.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916455" /><br/>
When it comes to landscape images that show a lot of sky, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max looks more natural. The colors are more accurate and the differences between sky and cloud are more pronounced for an overall better looking image. The Pixel 8 Pro trends toward a more blue tint for sky images, and it also has a tendency to overexpose in some shots. You'll also notice that the Pixel photos tend to be brighter, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> photos are downright moody.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-10.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916456" /><br/>
There are definite themes to color temperature, saturation, exposure, and other factors. Several of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max images feel oversaturated compared to the Pixel 8 Pro, with Apple giving deeper blacks and more vibrant colors, while Google's images have a brighter feel with contrast bumped down. In the taxi image, for example, the cars were not that shade of yellow that Apple produced, but both images look good and choosing a favorite will depend on whether you prefer images that are more saturated or brighter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-11.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916457" /><br/>
Apple's 5x Telephoto lens is limited to 12 megapixels and it does not have the wide aperture of the Main lens, so it should not be a surprise that the images that come out of it look different in terms of sharpness and saturation. 5x images from the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max and the Pixel 8 Pro look similar in most instances, but the Pixel 8 Pro seems to have more pronounced textures because the images are brighter with the contrast bumped up a bit more than what we're getting with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-15.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916458" /><br/>
Apple's 5x zoom lens has an edge when it comes to portrait mode because it can capture 5x portraits, while the Pixel is limited to 2x portraits. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; really wins out in terms of background blur, and even in portraits with other lenses, Apple is doing better with color, skin tone, and blur. The Pixel's portrait images sometimes come out better in situations with lower light.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-18.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916459" /><br/>
As for night shots, iPhones have always been a bit ahead in terms of a natural look, and that hasn't changed. The nighttime images from the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are more true to life, while the Pixel 8 Pro is much brighter and doesn't have the same nighttime mood.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-16.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916460" /><br/>
Apple's video stabilization has always been tough to beat, and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max produces better video than you get with the Pixel 8 Pro. Google has caught up somewhat with its latest smartphones, but Apple remains a step ahead. For pros, Apple also has an option for ProRes Log recording, so you can record a flat image that can be used with custom LUTs in post-processing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-22.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916461" /><br/>
Google has added some fun AI features to its camera that Apple can't compete with. Best Take, for example, sorts through multiple group photos that have been captured and finds the best shot. You can go change each person's face, swapping in from another in the series so that each person is smiling and looking at the camera. Magic Editor lets you erase objects in an image and uses generative AI to fill in the blank spot, and the Audio Magic Eraser can pull out unwanted sounds.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's first MacBook Pro models with OLED displays are still at least three years away from launching, according to information shared today by Ross Young, CEO of research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M2-Feature-Blue-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881249" /><br/>
On a <a href="https://bloomberg.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lWrE5XzyQkSCqFzJhqor1w#/registration">display-related webinar</a> with Bloomberg Intelligence's Woo Jin Ho, Young said it will take a few years for Apple's supply chain partners to build out manufacturing lines for mass production of laptop-sized OLED panels, so he does not expect MacBook Pro models with OLED displays to launch until 2026 or 2027. He has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/04/macbook-pro-not-getting-oled-until-2026/">shared this timeframe previously</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to current MacBook Pro models with LCD screens, benefits of OLED technology would include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, improved power efficiency for longer battery life, and more.<br/>
<br/>
As widely rumored, Young reiterated that the next-generation iPad Pro models launching in 2024 will also be equipped with OLED displays. The first iPad Air and iPad mini models with OLED displays are not expected to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/oled-ipad-mini-and-ipad-air-2026/">until 2026</a>; accordingly, Young confirmed that these devices will remain equipped with LCD screens next year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a week after the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">second tvOS 17.1 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers can download the tvOS 17.1 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. tvOS 17.1 adds a new favoriting option to the Music app on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, along with some other minor Music changes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't often know much about what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release. Apple has also seeded a new beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 17.1 software for developers. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Beta of tvOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-beta-of-tvos-17-1-to-developers.2407232/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple's MagSafe accessories and AirTags haven't seen as steep discounts as previous sale events earlier in 2023, but you can still find decent deals during Prime Day. The AirTag 4-Pack at &#36;88.99 is a good second-best price for the tracking accessory, and the MagSafe Charger at &#36;33.00 is just about &#36;3 higher than its most common sale price.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to bring OLED displays to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, according to a post on the Korean social media site Naver from a user with a track record for posting Apple rumors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/OLED-iPad-Air.jpg" alt="" width="2363" height="1329" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-806474" /><br/>
The <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223232907661&navType=by">post</a> cites supply chain sources and claims that Apple has now begun negotiations with Chinese suppliers, as well as Samsung and LG, related to OLED displays for future &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models. Apple reportedly seeks for the components to be mass produced from the end of 2025, suggesting that launch could follow in early 2026.<br/>
<br/>
The information lines up with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/oled-ipad-mini-and-ipad-air-2026/">report</a> from technology research firm Omdia that was published earlier this week, which forecasted Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> display panel purchase plans. The potential transition to OLED on Apple's two mid-range tablets is said to be part of its OLED strategy from 2026 onwards.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has apparently not yet fully committed to bringing the more advanced display technology to its mid-range tablets, and may be planning to review how the market responds to the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models that feature OLED displays, which are expected to launch next year, before locking in new panels for the 2026 &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The report also corroborated details about the rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">iPad Pro models with OLED displays</a> that are widely anticipated to launch next year, with the panels due to be supplied by LG and Samsung. Apple was said to be seeking more suppliers for OLED displays designed for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, which aligns with the Naver post's mention of additional Chinese suppliers.<br/>
<br/>
Reports suggest that the seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; and sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, which are expected to launch relatively soon, will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/new-ipad-air-reportedly-in-development/">minor specification upgrades</a> that focus on newer processors, rather than major updates <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/ipad-mini-7-no-promotion-display/">like more advanced display technology</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/apple-planning-to-bring-oled-to-ipad-mini-and-air/">Apple Reportedly Planning to Bring OLED to iPad Mini and iPad Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-planning-to-bring-oled-to-ipad-mini-and-ipad-air.2407197/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Google Pays Apple &#36;18B to &#36;20B a Year to Be Default iOS Search Engine</title>

		<description><![CDATA[It's widely known that Apple and Google have a considerable monetary agreement that ensures Google's position as the default search engine on Apple's iOS devices, but neither company reveals the amounts involved. In 2021, financial advisor Bernstein <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/27/google-could-pay-apple-15-billion-default-search/">suggested</a> Google was paying Apple as much as &#36;10 billion a year to maintain the status quo. However, in a new investor note, the analyst claims Google's payment to Apple is now between &#36;18 billion and &#36;20 billion. <br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/safari-google-search.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916340" /><br/>
First reported by <em><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/10/google_pays_apple_18_20_claims_bernstein/">The Register</a></em>, Bernstein published a report assessing the potential implications for Apple of the US government's ongoing antitrust trial against Google, with the Department of Justice considering Google's Information Services Agreement (ISA) with Apple as evidence that it has a search engine monopoly.<br/>
<blockquote>"We believe there is a possibility that federal courts rule against Google and force it to terminate its search deal with Apple," said Bernstein in the report seen by The Register. "We estimate that the ISA is worth &#36;18B-20B in annual payments from Google to Apple, accounting for 14-16 percent of Apple's annual operating profits."</blockquote>Bernstein says Google pays out 22 percent of total ad revenue under its traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and estimates Apple likely receives around 40 percent of this. Bernstein bases its numbers on Apple's public filings as well as a bottom-up analysis of Google's traffic acquisition costs. The DoJ has said in the trial that it thinks Apple receives around &#36;10 billion from the ISA with Google, although its information comes from external sources.<br/>
<blockquote>"Importantly, Google is on trial, not Apple, and Apple could (in theory) partner with another search engine to be the default (and/or retain the agreement with Google outside the US)," the report states. "One more likely scenario is that Apple offers a choice screen. We note that Apple controls access to its installed base, which generates ~&#36;60B + in advertising revenues, and accordingly, we believe that Apple would continue to command a commission (in the 25-30 percent range) for providing access to those search advertising revenues.<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, introduction of a choice screen could offer Apple the opportunity to potentially launch its own search engine as an option – something it could likely not do today without raising the eyebrows of regulators," the Bernstein report adds.</blockquote>Last month, the trial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/">revealed</a> that Microsoft considered selling its Bing search engine to Apple. Had the acquisition happened, Bing would have replaced Google as the default search engine on Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
Experts say there is a chance Google could lose the case, which would put Apple's lucrative agreement, which has been in place for a decade, in significant jeopardy. However, a ruling in the case isn't expected before next year, and the likelihood is that proceedings will be extended by the lengthy appeals process.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/google-pays-apple-billions-default-search/">Google Pays Apple &#36;18B to &#36;20B a Year to Be Default iOS Search Engine</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-pays-apple-18b-to-20b-a-year-to-be-default-ios-search-engine.2407183/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
