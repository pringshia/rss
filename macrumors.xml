		<description><![CDATA[It's looking like 2025 is going to be an important year for Apple, with the company planning to revamp the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, push further into smart home products, and improve <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>. There are <em>tons</em> of new products rumored for 2025, including new iPhones, M4 Macs, a smart home command center, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature-Single-Camera-2-Redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974630" /><br/>
We've highlighted the top five Apple products that will have the biggest impact in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 17 "Air"</h2><br/>
There's a new, super thin &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; planned for 2025, and while we don't know what Apple will call it, rumors have taken to referring to it as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> Air. It's a fitting name, because it won't be as powerful or as pricey as the Pro models, but it will be more expensive than the standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Air will be somewhere around 6mm thick, which will make it the thinnest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date. For reference, Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> is 8.25mm thick, so we're looking at a good 2mm difference.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2100" height="1181" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974632" /><br/>
The new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is rumored to have a 6.6-inch display, coming in between the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro Max in size. It will only have a single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera because of space constraints, and it's going to be one of the first devices to feature Apple's new 5G modem.<br/>
<br/>
We're still getting a regular &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, but there won't be an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Plus this year. Apple also plans to sell the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Air alongside &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro and Pro Max models, and rumors suggest there are some design changes coming to those models, too. So far, it sounds like we're going to get a half-aluminum half-glass design for the back panel that could improve durability, plus the camera setup could get a redesign.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-17-Pro-Dual-Tone-Vertical-1.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980396" /><br/>
All four iPhones in 2025 will get A19 chips, and ProMotion 120Hz display technology isn't going to be limited to the Pro models anymore.<br/>
<br/>
You can read more about the features rumored for the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">in our iPhone 17 roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods Pro 3</h2><br/>
Apple refreshed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> in 2024, and in 2025, we'll get an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> update. Apple is rumored to be updating the design, but just what the earbuds will look like remains unclear. The &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; got a slimmed down case, so that could be what we see for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> too.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/airpods-pro-2-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947354" /><br/>
Both sound quality and Active Noise Cancellation are expected to improve, mostly due to Apple unveiling a next-generation H series chip. Apple hasn't introduced a new audio chip for some time now, so it will be exciting to see what features an update will bring.<br/>
<br/>
There have been some rumors about heart rate tracking and temperature monitoring coming to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; at some point, so that's a possibility as well. More on what we've heard about the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">can be found in our guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Command Center</h2><br/>
Apple plans to unveil a small, square-shaped home "Command Center" device that will be used for controlling smart home devices, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls, watching videos, and more. It essentially sounds like it's going to be Apple's version of the Echo Show.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-5.png" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978087" /><br/>
The six-inch device will be small enough to take from room to room, and you can use it on a tabletop or mount it on the wall. It will hopefully be affordable enough that you can have multiple devices across different rooms, streamlining the increasing number of smart home products many of us have in our homes.<br/>
<br/>
The Command Center will have standard Apple apps like Home, Calendar, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/">Apple News</a>, and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, but Apple isn't making a dedicated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for it. You'll be able to use it for video calls, and expect deep &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; integration.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone SE 4</h2><br/>
Apple is finally ready to refresh its low-cost &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> 4 is going to get a <em>lot</em> of improvements that have the potential to make it an incredible value.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-SE-4-Single-Camera-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978494" /><br/>
Small screen sizes and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> are a thing of the past, so the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will have a 6.1-inch OLED display and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>. In fact, rumors suggest that it's modeled after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>. There will be a single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera, a notch for &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, and a USB-C port for charging.<br/>
<br/>
The larger screen size, OLED display technology, &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, and higher megapixel camera will all be new to the SE lineup. The device is also expected to be the first to get Apple's in-house 5G modem, and it is rumored to have the same A18 chip that's in the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The A18 chip supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, so the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, Writing Tools, smarter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, and more, plus 8GB RAM is the minimum for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, so it's also going to get a big memory boost.<br/>
<br/>
When it launches, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;'s performance will be on par with the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, which is impressive for a low-cost &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. There's been no word that Apple plans to raise prices, and we're still expecting the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; to cost less than &#36;500.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Siri Improvements</h2><br/>
In spring updates coming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple plans to add new functionality to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, including onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to take more actions in and across apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947754" /><br/>
Onscreen awareness will let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; see and understand what's on your display, so you can reference it in voice requests. If you're looking at a photo and want to send it to your friend Eric, for example, you will be able to say "Send this to Eric," and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will understand what "this" is.<br/>
<br/>
Personal context will allow &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to do more with your personal data like emails and messages, learning more about you to be more helpful. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will know who you're communicating with, how you use your device, and will keep track of everything you have stored. Personal context will let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; do things like find a specific message, locate a recent file, find content in emails like flight numbers, or remind you when you took a photo you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s ability to do more in and across apps will majorly improve what &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is capable of. You'll be able to move files from one app to another, edit photos with voice commands, and complete multi-step multi-app processes that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; isn't currently capable of handling.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">In iOS 19</a>, coming in June, Apple plans to unveil LLM &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, or a version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; trained on a large language model. LLM training will make &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; more like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, allowing &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to understand and generate natural, human-like language, perform complex tasks, and solve problems. While &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will add helpful new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality, the real &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; evolution will come with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> and subsequent updates.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> users can watch a new episode of the "Adventure" series starting today, delving into a freezing underwater dive in the Arctic with athlete Ant Williams.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/vision-pro-ice-dive.jpg" alt="" width="1851" height="1041" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982956" /><br/>
The Ice Dive episode follows Williams as he attempts to shatter the world record for swimming the longest distance under ice with just one breath.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Plunge into the Arctic's waters with the new Adventure episode " src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZ6UqoVpl8s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Ice Dive is the third episode in the Adventure series on the Vision Pro headset. The first Adventure episode, Highlining, was one of the first immersive videos that Apple made available when the Vision Pro launched. Parkour, another episode, launched earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been working to bring more 3D videos to the Vision Pro over the last few months. There have been new dinosaur-focused Prehistoric Planet episodes, a new Boundless series exploring extraordinary places, a short film called Submerged, and more music-related content.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/20/ice-dive-apple-vision-pro-immersive-video/">&#039;Ice Dive&#039; Apple Vision Pro Immersive Video Now Available</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ice-dive-apple-vision-pro-immersive-video-now-available.2445847/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<li><strong>iPhone SE 4 (March)</strong>: &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14-like design, 6.1-inch OLED display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, A18 chip, USB-C port, single 48-megapixel camera, 8GB memory, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support, and Apple-designed 5G modem.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting today, the third-generation iPhone SE, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus, are listed as unavailable on Apple's online store in Switzerland, ahead of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/04/eu-passes-law-to-switch-iphone-to-usb-c-in-2024/">regulation</a> that will require smartphones with wired charging capabilities that are newly placed for sale to be equipped with a USB-C port in the European Union (EU).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/iPhone-SE-3-Apple-Newsroom.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982180" /><br/>
Switzerland is not officially part of the EU, but the country participates in the single EU market and is thereby subject to EU trading laws.<br/>
<br/>
While all iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models are equipped with USB-C ports for wired charging, the iPhone SE, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus still have Lightning ports, so Apple appears to be responding to the upcoming regulation. The law applies to any individual iPhone unit placed for sale after the deadline, even if they are older models.<br/>
<br/>
French website <em>iGeneration</em> last week reported that the iPhone SE, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/13/iphone-14-and-iphone-se-eu-report/">would no longer be sold</a> through Apple's online store and retail stores in EU countries starting December 28, which is when the regulation goes into force. However, the report said sales of the iPhones would be halted on Apple's online store in Switzerland around one week earlier, and that has now happened. The report said in-store availability at Apple's retail locations in Switzerland will continue until December 28.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the Switzerland aspect of the report has now proven to be accurate, it is likely next week that Apple will make the affected iPhones unavailable across all 27 countries in the EU, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and others. While the United Kingdom left the EU in 2020, Northern Ireland continues to participate in the single EU market.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Authorized Resellers in the EU will be able to continue selling the iPhones until their remaining inventory is depleted, the report said.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/iphone-se-4-expected-to-launch-in-march/">fourth-generation iPhone SE with a USB-C port in March</a>, so the device should quickly return to the EU. Meanwhile, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus likely would have been discontinued in September had the USB-C regulation not existed, so sales of those devices are ending in the EU around nine months early.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/20/iphone-14-iphone-se-unavailable-in-switzerland/">Apple Begins Discontinuing iPhone SE and iPhone 14 in EU Ahead of USB-C Requirement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-discontinuing-iphone-se-and-iphone-14-in-eu-ahead-of-usb-c-requirement.2445836/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI has expanded the capabilities of its ChatGPT app for macOS, adding support for Apple Notes and a range of popular third-party apps. The update builds on last month's release that introduced the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/openai-chatgpt-xcode-for-mac/">read on-screen content from select Mac apps</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/chatgpt-apple-notes.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982826" /><br/>
This expansion should broaden ChatGPT's utility for both casual users and developers using macOS, as the AI assistant can now interact with content in Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip, alongside numerous development environments including BBEdit, Android Studio, and various JetBrains IDEs. <br/>
<br/>
For developers, the update also adds support for additional IDEs including VSCode forks (VSCodium, Cursor, WindSurf) and terminal apps like Prompt and Warp. The AI can analyze code from multiple apps simultaneously, offering suggestions for improvements without manual copy-pasting.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI says that users maintain full control over which apps ChatGPT can access, and all data handling follows the same OpenAI privacy protocols as the app's regular conversation history. The expanded app integration feature remains exclusive to paid subscribers, including ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/work-with-apps-chatgpt.jpg" alt="chatgpt" width="1144" height="436" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982829" /><br/>
To get ChatGPT working with apps, enable the <strong>Work with Apps</strong> option in ChatGPT ➝ Settings and allow the necessary permissions via <strong>Manage Apps</strong>. Then you can access ChatGPT within supported apps in the following way:<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>With ChatGPT open, open a supported app (such as Apple Notes).</li><br/>
  <li>Press <strong>Option + Shift + 1</strong> to invoke the ChatGPT bar.</li><br/>
  <li>Type queries or use advanced voice mode for hands-free interaction.</li><br/>
</ol>The advanced voice mode is especially useful in this context, since it allows you to speak handsfree to ChatGPT and get suggestions or modifications to your on-screen content. OpenAI recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQDnWlwYyQ">demonstrated</a> the feature using a holiday party planning scenario, where ChatGPT provided song recommendations and party ideas using a <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10139238-santa-s-voice-in-chatgpt">Santa voice persona</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The ChatGPT app for macOS is available for download from <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/download/">OpenAI's website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/20/chatgpt-for-mac-can-now-read-apple-notes/">ChatGPT for Mac Can Now Read Your Apple Notes – Here&#039;s How</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpt-for-mac-can-now-read-your-apple-notes-–-heres-how.2445829/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/redrafter-nvidia-tensorrt-llm">shared details</a> on a collaboration with NVIDIA to greatly improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) by implementing a new text generation technique that offers substantial speed improvements for AI applications.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/ml-research-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982819" /><br/>
Apple earlier this year <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/recurrent-drafter">published</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-recurrent-drafter">open-sourced</a> Recurrent Drafter (ReDrafter), an approach that combines beam search and dynamic tree attention methods to accelerate text generation. Beam search explores multiple potential text sequences at once for better results, while tree attention organizes and removes redundant overlaps among these sequences to improve efficiency. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has now integrated the technology into NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM framework, which optimizes LLMs running on NVIDIA GPUs, where it achieved "state of the art performance," according to Apple. The integration saw the technique manage a 2.7x speed increase in tokens generated per second during testing with a production model containing tens of billions of parameters.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the improved performance not only reduces user-perceived latency but also leads to decreased GPU usage and power consumption. From Apple's <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/redrafter-nvidia-tensorrt-llm">Machine Learning Research blog</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>"LLMs are increasingly being used to power production applications, and improving inference efficiency can both impact computational costs and reduce latency for users.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple launched the controversial "trashcan" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> eleven years ago today, introducing one of its most criticized designs that persisted through a period of widespread discontentment with the Mac lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/08/mac_pro_creativity.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="475" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-419466" /><br/>
The redesign took the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; in an entirely new direction, spearheaded by a polished aluminum cylindrical design that became unofficially dubbed the "trashcan" in the Mac community. All of the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;'s components were mounted around a central thermal dissipation core, cooled by a single fan that pulled air from under the case, through the core, and out the top. The fan could spin more slowly than smaller fans and keep the Mac extremely quiet, even during intense operations.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the radically redesigned &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in 2013. During the announcement, Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/">Phil Schiller</a> infamously remarked "Can't innovate anymore, my ass." The comment was directed at critics who pointed at the previous &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;'s lack of updates and claimed Apple had largely abandoned its pro user base and was out of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/schiller_mac_pro.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-388211" /><em>&zwnj;Phil Schiller&zwnj; unveiling the redesigned &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; in 2013</em></div><br/>
Apple said that the new &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; offered twice the overall performance of the previous generation while taking up less than one-eighth of the volume, thanks to its unified thermal core. The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; twinned Intel Xeon processors with dual AMD FirePro workstation GPUs, enabling it to deliver seven teraflops of computing power.<br/>
<br/>
While the striking design was undoubtedly ambitious, users were unhappy with the way that almost all expansion had to be served externally by Thunderbolt 2 ports. Many professional users who were reliant on powerful hardware could not get past the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;'s lack of internal slots to add graphics cards and memory. <br/>
<br/>
The result was a device that was unable to adapt to changing hardware trends. Even Apple seemed unsure how to offer a meaningful hardware update for the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;; as recently as 2019, it was possible to buy a brand new trashcan &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; from Apple, with no upgrades coming to the device during the preceding six years.<br/>
<br/>
This led Apple to make a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/04/apple-apology-to-mac-pro-users-five-years-ago/">rare admission of the product's failure</a> during a meeting with reporters in April 2017, explaining in detail why the device didn't succeed in the way it had hoped. In 2019, Apple's full mea culpa came in the form of yet another &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; redesign, which took the machine back to a highly modular tower form factor with eight PCIe slots and three impeller fans.<br/>
<br/>
Yet in many respects, what the 2013 &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; set out to achieve—a small, powerful computer for professionals, with external expansion only—lives on and has been executed more effectively by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro">Mac Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1">Mac Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/trashcan-mac-pro-11-years-ago/">Apple Launched the Controversial &#039;Trashcan&#039; Mac Pro 11 Years Ago Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launched-the-controversial-trashcan-mac-pro-11-years-ago-today.2445813/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Making a device backup over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> now requires iOS 9 or later, which means iPhones and iPads that are running iOS 8 or earlier are no longer able to be backed up using &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/iCloud-General-Feature-Redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-982796" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/apple-icloud-backup-ios-9-minimum/">announced the change in November</a>, and as of this week, it has gone into effect. Support for &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; backups on devices that run iOS 8 or older has ended, and Apple has deleted all existing &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; backups of those devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apps and data stored on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> running iOS 8 or earlier are not affected, and these devices can still be manually backed up to a Mac or a Windows PC. If you have a device on iOS 8 or older, if you can update, you can restore &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; backup capabilities. Otherwise, all backups will need to be done manually.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that it discontinued &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; backups for older devices to "more closely align" with its minimum software requirements. With the iOS 9 update that came out years ago, Apple adopted CloudKit for &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; backups and stopped using an older system, and it looks like this older system is what's being sunset.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/icloud-backups-disabled-ios-8-or-earlier/">iCloud Backups No Longer Available for iPhones and iPads Running iOS 8 or Earlier</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/icloud-backups-no-longer-available-for-iphones-and-ipads-running-ios-8-or-earlier.2445802/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Likely to Make Vision Pro Lineup More Affordable in Two Ways</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to launch its next-generation Vision headsets as early as 2026, and they will likely be more affordable, <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20241219-12419.html">according to TrendForce</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
In line with previous rumors, the Taiwanese research firm today said Apple is planning to introduce both a next-generation Vision Pro and a mainstream headset, which would likely be named "Apple Vision" without the "Pro" modifier.<br/>
<br/>
For the next-generation Vision Pro, TrendForce said Apple will likely consider sourcing components from suppliers beyond Sony to reduce production costs, and this move could contribute to the headset having a lower price. Currently, the Vision Pro starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S., and this price has naturally limited sales of the device.<br/>
<br/>
In an interview earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/tim-cook-admits-truth-about-vision-pro/">acknowledged that the Vision Pro is not a mass-market product</a> due to its high price.<br/>
<br/>
"At &#36;3,500, it's not a mass-market product," said Cook. "Right now, it's an early-adopter product. People who want to have tomorrow's technology today—that's who it's for. Fortunately, there's enough people who are in that camp that it's exciting."<br/>
<br/>
In July, research firm IDC estimated that Vision Pro sales would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/">below 500,000 units this year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While the next Vision Pro could be at least slightly more affordable, TrendForce ensured that the device will continue to have high-end specifications, including display technology with a resolution exceeding 3,000 pixels per inch.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to a Vision Pro price cut, a lower-end model is also expected eventually.<br/>
<br/>
For this mainstream Vision headset, the research firm said that Apple is expected to focus on "affordability and "cost-efficiency" as a main priority, which should make visionOS accessible to more customers at a considerably lower price compared to the Vision Pro. It said the device could have less-advanced displays to keep costs down.<br/>
<br/>
"Possible display options for this model include glass-based OLED displays and LCDs with LTPO backplane technology, both of which offer a balance between performance and cost," said TrendForce, in a press release.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo last month said the next Vision Pro will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/">actually launch in 2025, with an M5 chip</a> in place of the current M2 chip, but he said Apple pushed back its plans for a cheaper Vision headset until beyond 2027.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/">TrendForce</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/vision-pro-affordability/">Apple Likely to Make Vision Pro Lineup More Affordable in Two Ways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-make-vision-pro-lineup-more-affordable-in-two-ways.2445783/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.1.1, preventing iPhone users who have upgraded to iOS 18.2 from downgrading to that version of iOS. Apple released iOS 18.2 a week ago on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">December 11</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/ios-18-1-1-security-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2228" height="1253" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-982744" /><br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.<br/>
<br/>
This policy encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date, ensuring they have the latest security enhancements. Apple also stopped signing iOS 17.7.2 on Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
The iOS 18.1.1 update provided <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-releases-ios-18-1-1-and-ipados-18-1-1/">important security fixes</a>, but no other notable changes.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is facing calls to remove its AI-powered notification summaries feature after it generated false headlines about a high-profile murder case, drawing criticism from a major journalism organization.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/bbc-news-headlines-notification-summary.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982725" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Updated to iOS 18.2? Then you may have received this notification (image credit: BBC News)</em></div><br/>
<br/>
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has urged Apple to disable the Apple Intelligence notification feature, which rolled out globally last week as part of its iOS 18.2 software update. The request comes after the feature created a misleading headline suggesting that murder suspect Luigi Mangione had shot himself, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno">incorrectly attributing the false information to BBC News</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Mangione in fact remains under maximum security at Huntingdon State Correctional Institution in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, after having been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson in New York.<br/>
<br/>
The BBC has confirmed that it filed a complaint with Apple regarding the headline incident. The RSF has since <a href="https://rsf.org/en/rsf-urges-apple-remove-its-new-generative-ai-feature-after-it-wrongly-attributes-false-information">argued</a> that summaries of the type prove that "generative AI services are still too immature to produce reliable information for the public." <br/>
<br/>
Vincent Berthier, head of RSF's technology and journalism desk, said that "AIs are probability machines, and facts can't be decided by a roll of the dice." He called the automated production of false information "a danger to the public's right to reliable information."<br/>
<br/>
This isn't an isolated incident, either. <em>The New York Times</em> reportedly experienced a similar issue when Apple Intelligence incorrectly summarized an article about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/schwanksta.com/post/3lbi6rxhigc2r">creating a notification claiming he had been arrested</a> when the original article discussed an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's AI feature aims to reduce notification overload by condensing alerts into brief summaries, and is currently available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16 models, and select iPads and Macs running the latest operating system versions. The summarization feature is enabled by default, but users can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-turn-off-notification-summaries/">manually disable it through their device settings</a>.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-turn-off-notification-summaries/">iOS Notification Summaries Lost in Translation? How to Turn Them Off</a></li></ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly negotiating with China's ByteDance and Tencent to bring their artificial intelligence models to iPhones sold in China, as the company adapts its AI strategy for the Chinese market.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/iOS-18.2-ChatGPT-Feature-3-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982614" /><br/>
Apple began integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices globally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">earlier this month</a> with the release of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, but ChatGPT is not accessible in China due to regulatory restrictions. Chinese law requires government approval before companies can release generative AI services to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Both ByteDance and Tencent have developed their own AI models - Doubao and Hunyuan respectively - which could potentially be integrated into Chinese iPhones if the talks prove successful. However, negotiations are said to be still in early stages, according to sources cited by <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/apple-talks-with-tencent-bytedance-roll-out-ai-features-china-sources-say-2024-12-19/">Reuters</a></em>. Apple is reported to have previously held talks with Baidu about similar AI integration.<br/>
<br/>
Any partnership could be particularly significant as Apple faces increasing competition in China's smartphone market. The company briefly dropped out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter of 2023 before recovering in the third quarter, though its sales still declined 0.3% year-over-year.<br/>

Meanwhile, Huawei has gained momentum in the Chinese market, with sales surging 42% in the third quarter. The company's recent Mate 70 series features AI capabilities powered by its own home-grown large language model.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/apple-in-talks-tencent-bytedance-china-ai/">Report: Apple in Talks with Tencent, ByteDance for Chinese iPhone AI</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-in-talks-with-tencent-bytedance-for-chinese-iphone-ai.2445770/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is close to reaching an agreement with Indonesia to lift the ban on iPhone 16 sales in the country after securing preliminary approval for a &#36;1 billion investment proposal, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-19/apple-close-to-winning-indonesian-approval-to-end-iphone-16-ban">Bloomberg</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-16-Apple-Store.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976828" /><br/>
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is said to have given his support for the government to accept Apple's investment plan following a weekend briefing. The proposal includes establishing manufacturing facilities in the country, with one of Apple's suppliers set to build an AirTag production plant on Batam island.<br/>
<br/>
The Batam facility is expected to initially employ 1,000 workers and will eventually account for 20% of global AirTag production. The location was chosen for its free-trade zone status, which provides tax exemptions and import duty benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Additional investments will fund a separate manufacturing facility in Bandung for producing other accessories, as well as expanding Apple's existing developer academies in Indonesia. President Prabowo has directed his Economic Affairs Ministry to finalize the agreement, but no specific timeline has been provided for lifting the iPhone 16 sales ban.<br/>
<br/>
The ban was implemented in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/indonesia-bans-iphone-16-sales/">October</a> after Indonesian authorities determined Apple had failed to meet the country's requirement for 40% domestic content in smartphones. Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-raises-indonesia-investment-offer-iphone-ban/">latest proposal</a> represents a significant increase from its previous offers of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/indonesia-iphone-ban-apple-10m-investment/">&#36;10 million</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ups-invest-offer-indonesia-iphone-16-ban/">&#36;100 million</a>, which were rejected by the government.<br/>
<br/>
If approved, the deal would mark a success for President Prabowo's efforts to attract foreign investment while demonstrating the effectiveness of Indonesia's strategy to pressure international companies into developing products locally. The country remains a significant market for Apple, with over half of its 278 million residents under the age of 44.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/">Indonesia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/apple-nears-deal-to-end-iphone-16-ban-indonesia/">Apple&#039;s &#36;1 Billion Investment May Soon End Indonesian iPhone Ban</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-1-billion-investment-may-soon-end-indonesian-iphone-ban.2445768/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/DMA-Interoperability-Dec-2024.pdf">released a report</a> highlighting its concerns about how some companies could "weaponize" the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) interoperability requirements to access sensitive user data. The report came on the same day that the European Commission began consulting on the <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/dma100204-consultation-proposed-measures-requesting-interoperability-apples-ios-and-ipados-operating_en">proposed measures for requesting interoperability</a> with Apple's iOS and iPadOS operating systems.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
The DMA, which came into force this year, requires major platform holders like Apple to provide third-party developers equal access to iOS and iPadOS system tools and features. One of the Commission's proceedings focuses on the process Apple has set up to address interoperability requests submitted by developers and third parties for iOS and iPadOS. While Apple says it is fully committed to complying with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_4761">interoperability regulations</a>, which aim to create fair competition, it is worried about unintended consequences resulting from the law's interpretation that could have a negative impact on user privacy. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's report specifically calls out Meta, which has made 15 separate requests "and counting" for access to Apple's technology stack. According to Apple, Meta's requests have included access to features like messaging capabilities, AirPlay, CarPlay, and the App Intents framework. If granted as requested, Apple warns that these permissions would potentially allow Meta's apps to access a range of user data spanning messages, phone calls, photos, app usage, and passwords on their devices.<br/>
<br/>
"In many cases, Meta is seeking to alter functionality in a way [...] that appears to be completely unrelated to the actual use of Meta external devices, such as Meta smart glasses and Meta Quests," says Apple. The report continues: <blockquote>"If Apple were to have to grant all of these requests, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp could enable Meta to read on a user's device all of their messages and emails, see every phone call they make or receive, track every app that they use, scan all of their photos, look at their files and calendar events, log all of their passwords, and more. <strong>This is data that Apple itself has chosen not to access in order to provide the strongest possible protection to users.</strong>"</blockquote>Apple in the report is keen to emphasize its longtime support for developer access to device features through more than 250,000 APIs, but always with built-in privacy protections. The company points to historical examples like TouchID implementation and microphone access, where developers can take advantage of these features while maintaining privacy and control safeguards.<br/>
<br/>
The report expresses particular concern about companies with previous privacy violations potentially circumventing GDPR protections through DMA requirements. Apple notes that while it processes data on-device whenever possible, other companies might use that information for their own gain. "Third parties may not have the same commitment to keeping the user in control on their device as Apple, and may prefer to move user information to their servers—where they can combine, profile, and monetize an individual's private data," Apple warns.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/meta-interoperability-requests-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1470" height="774" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982710" /><br/>
Apple's publication underlines its commitment to reviewing and implementing interoperability requests as per the DMA when feasible, but the company argues that solutions must preserve platform integrity and protect sensitive user data. As a way to achieve this, Apple outlines its four-step process for handling interoperability requests that includes initial assessment, project planning, development, and release phases.<br/>
<br/>
"We will never abandon our bedrock commitment to our users' privacy and security," adds Apple. "We trust that the EC will seek to implement the interoperability requirements in a manner that respects the GDPR." <br/>
<br/>
Meta yesterday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/apple-meta-interoperability-requests-dma/">responded</a> to Apple's criticisms, claiming that "Every time Apple is called out for its anti-competitive behavior, they defend themselves on privacy grounds that have no basis in reality." However, Meta itself has previously come under criticism for privacy violations several times. Just this week, the UK's Ofcom said it was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14199183/instagram-ofcom-investigation-child-sex-abuse-ads.html">opening an investigation</a> into Meta's Instagram for "turning a blind eye to ads for child sex abuse," while a new report by <a href="https://content.mlex.com/#/content/1618085/more-than-half-of-uk-scams-involve-meta-platforms-regulator-says?referrer=email_instantcontentset&paddleid=1&paddleaois=2000;2001;2003;2007;2008;2009;2005;2006">MLex</a> said that more than half of UK scams involve Meta platforms. <br/>
<br/>
Meta has also been fined €251 million (&#36;265 million) by Ireland's Data Protection Commission for a 2018 Facebook breach affecting three million accounts in Europe, exposing names, contact details, locations, and children's data. Meta is expected to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/meta-fined-263m-over-2018-security-breach-that-affected-3m-eu-users/">appeal the decision</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Commission's interoperability proceedings began in September 2024 and are set to conclude within six months of opening.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/apple-warns-privacy-risks-eu-dma/">Apple Warns of Privacy Risks in EU&#039;s DMA Interoperability Requirements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-warns-of-privacy-risks-in-eus-dma-interoperability-requirements.2445767/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today marks eight years since Apple launched the original AirPods. Unveiled in September 2016 alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 7, the wireless headphones became available on December 19, 2016, following a slight delay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/AirPods-Launched-Eight-Years-Ago-Today-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-981921" /><br/>
At the time, wireless headphones were already on the market but had not yet reached true mass popularity. AirPods helped redefine the category through their convenience and seamless integration with Apple devices. Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/">Phil Schiller</a> at the time:<blockquote>AirPods are the first headphones to deliver a breakthrough wireless audio experience, and with the new Apple W1 chip they deliver innovative features including high quality sound, great battery life and automatic setup. AirPods are simple and magical to use, with no switches or buttons, automatically connecting to all your Apple devices simply and seamlessly, and letting you access Siri with just a double tap. We can't wait for users to try them with iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Priced at &#36;159, the first-generation AirPods introduced key features such as one-tap pairing with Apple devices and in-ear detection for automatic play-pause functionality. Powered by Apple's custom W1 chip, they delivered enhanced audio quality compared to wired EarPods and set a new standard for battery life in a compact, completely wireless design.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Since their debut, AirPods have evolved with the release of second-, third-, and fourth-generation models in March 2019, October 2021, and September 2024. These updates brought improvements such as better audio quality, longer battery life, hands-free "Hey <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>" functionality, a wireless charging case, and, most recently, active noise cancellation. The product line has also expanded with the premium <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, featuring an in-ear design and active noise cancellation, in October 2019, and the over-ear <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> in December 2020.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/airpods-launched-eight-years-ago/">Apple Released the Original AirPods Eight Years Ago Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-released-the-original-airpods-eight-years-ago-today.2445764/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today said that Meta has made 15 interoperability requests under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, which is more than any other company.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
In a statement provided to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-slams-metas-numerous-interoperability-requests-2024-12-18/">Reuters</a></em>, Apple said that Meta is asking for changes that could compromise user security and privacy.<br/>
<blockquote>In many cases, Meta is seeking to alter functionality in a way that raises concerns about the privacy and security of users, and that appears to be completely unrelated to the actual use of Meta external devices, such as Meta smart glasses and Meta Quest.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple were to have to grant all of these requests, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp could enable Meta to read on a user's device all of their messages and emails, see every phone call they make or receive, track every app that they use, scan all of their photos, look at their files and calendar events, log all of their passwords, and more.</blockquote><br/>
Under the terms of the DMA, which affects iOS and iPadOS, Apple is required to allow app developers to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/ios-interoperability/">submit interoperability requests</a> for hardware and software. Apple assesses all requests to determine whether they fall into the appropriate article of the DMA, and if so, Apple will design a solution for effective interoperability. Apple warns that the integrity of iOS and iPadOS are "important considerations" and that it may not be feasible for the company to design an effective interoperability solution.<br/>
<br/>
In response to Apple's comments on Meta's requests, Meta said the following: "What Apple is actually saying is they don’t believe in interoperability. Every time Apple is called out for its anticompetitive behavior, they defend themselves on privacy grounds that have no basis in reality." <br/>
<br/>
Apple's complaint about Meta comes as the European Union has <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/dma100204-consultation-proposed-measures-requesting-interoperability-apples-ios-and-ipados-operating_en">shared preliminary findings</a> on proposed measures that Apple should implement for improved interoperability. The European Commission says that Apple needs to give developers a better overview of the iOS components that provide functionalities reserved to Apple, plus Apple is required to design a better process that makes it easier to submit interoperability requests. Apple must also adhere to stricter timelines and avoid delays providing feedback on requested features. <br/>
<br/>
The European Commission is now consulting interested third parties on whether its preliminary findings are sufficient to make Apple's request-based process effective. The EC says that the measures could be adjusted based on feedback from Apple and from third parties.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI today announced support for a new phone-based ChatGPT experience, which can be accessed by calling or texting 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478). The feature was introduced as part of OpenAI's ongoing 12 days of OpenAI event.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="1-800-CHAT-GPT--12 Days of OpenAI: Day 10" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWa6OHeNK3s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The 1-800-ChatGPT phone number is designed for situations where a data connection is unavailable, but a cellular connection works. With the feature, ChatGPT can provide answers to questions over the phone with voice-based responses, and even landlines are supported. Texting ChatGPT can be done through WhatsApp using the same number, but images and videos aren't supported at this time. <br/>
<br/>
Any U.S. phone number can contact ChatGPT and get 15 minutes of response time for free without an OpenAI account, but downloading the app and creating an account allows for additional call time.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI says that the dedicated phone number is an experimental way to talk to ChatGPT, so availability and limits could change in the future.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/openai-chatgpt-phone-line/">You Can Now Call 1-800-ChatGPT Using a Phone Line to Get AI Answers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-now-call-1-800-chatgpt-using-a-phone-line-to-get-ai-answers.2445748/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
