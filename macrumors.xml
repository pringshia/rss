		<description><![CDATA[Apple has dealt a blow against spyware maker NSO Group and the Israeli firm's efforts to move Apple's lawsuit against it to its home country. Apple in November 2021 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/23/apple-sues-nso-group/">sued the group</a> and its parent company with the aim of holding it accountable for targeting Apple users with spyware used for surveillance purposes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-security-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1145" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-796484" /><br/>
Judge Donato <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.388382/gov.uscourts.cand.388382.87.0.pdf">denied</a> NSO's motion to dismiss Apple's case "in all respects," and rejected the group's arguments that Apple should be required to bring its lawsuit to Israel, deciding instead that the case will proceed in the United States. <br/>
<br/>
The court also ruled that Apple had adequately alleged that NSO violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and California’s Unfair Competition Law, breached its contract with Apple, and that NSO unjustly enriched itself at the expense of Apple and its users.<br/>
<br/>
In the lawsuit, Apple offers up information on how NSO Group infiltrated the devices of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners and how it utilized the Pegasus spyware to do so. Apple is asking for a permanent injunction that would ban NSO Group from using Apple software, services, or devices.<br/>
<br/>
An Apple spokesperson said the victory meant that Apple could proceed in U.S. court to hold NSO accountable and continue to protect Apple's users, products, and infrastructure from hacker groups like NSO.<br/>
<br/>
NSO Group created invasive spyware known as "Pegasus" that was sold to various world governments and was used to access the devices of journalists, lawyers, and human rights activists. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has been working on fixing exploits and has addressed major Pegasus-related hacks in updates to its software since iOS 14.6. In addition to filing a lawsuit against NSO Group, Apple plans to contribute &#36;10 million to organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy. <br/>
<br/>
"State-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability," said Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi in 2021. "That needs to change."<br/>
<br/>
NSO will have to answer Apple's complaint in a U.S. court by February 14, 2024. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/">Apple Security</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/privacy/">Privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/apple-early-victory-nso-group-spyware-lawsuit/">Apple Wins Early Victory Against Spyware Maker NSO Group in Court</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wins-early-victory-against-spyware-maker-nso-group-in-court.2417289/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Music Classical is now available in China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, fulfilling a rollout promise to the regions that Apple made <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-music-classical-expanding-to-more-countries/">earlier this month</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/apple-music-classical.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-890263" /><br/>
Apple Music Classical first launched in most other countries in March 2023. The ‌Apple Music‌ Classical app offers ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers access to over five million classical music tracks, including new high-quality releases, in addition to hundreds of curated playlists, thousands of exclusive albums, and other features like composer bios and deep dives on key works.<br/>
<br/>
The app offers a simpler interface for interacting with classical music specifically. Unlike the existing ‌Apple Music‌ app, ‌Apple Music‌ Classical allows users to search by composer, work, conductor, catalog number, and more. Users can get more detailed information from editorial notes and descriptions.<br/>
<br/>
The app can be pre-ordered now on the App Store in the above regions. In the U.S., a standard Apple Music subscription costs &#36;10.99 per month.<br/>
 <br/>
In 2021, Apple announced that it had purchased the classical music streaming service Primephonic and would be folding it into ‌Apple Music‌ via a new app dedicated to the genre. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music-classical/">Apple Music Classical</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/apple-music-classical-now-available-china-japan/">Apple Music Classical Now Available in China, Japan, and More Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-classical-now-available-in-china-japan-and-more-countries.2417285/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[X, formerly Twitter, now supports passkeys as a login option for iOS users in the United States, the company has <a href="https://x.com/Safety/status/1749881895641633080?s=20">announced</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/X-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904140" /><br/>
Passkeys are both easier to use and more secure than passwords because they let users sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices: With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, or a device passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple integrated passkeys into iOS in 2022 with the launch of iOS 16, and it is also available in iPadOS 16.1 and later as well as macOS Ventura and later.<br/>
<br/>
To set up passkeys in X, follow these steps:<br/>
<ol><li>Log in to the X app.</li><br/>
<li>Click <strong>Your account</strong> in the navigation bar.</li><br/>
<li>Select <strong>Settings and privacy</strong>, then click <strong>Security and account access</strong>, then <strong>Security</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under <strong>Additional password protection</strong>, click <strong>Passkey</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Enter your password when prompted.</li><br/>
<li>Select <strong>Add a passkey</strong> and follow the prompts.</li></ol><br/>
X says passkeys are currently only rolling out to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the U.S., and hasn't said when the feature will be extended to other platforms and countries. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we’re excited to launch Passkeys as a login option for our US-based users on iOS!<br><br>A passkey is a new, easy to use, and secure way to log in to your account - all from your device.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has been quietly making a series of artificial intelligence related acquisitions and staff hires in a bid to bring on-device AI to its next-generation iPhones, claims a new report by the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/52839eb2-6641-42a6-acd7-5d41e809c97a">Financial Times</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/siri-symbol-iphone-feature.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="481" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927705" /><br/>
According to the report, indications suggest Apple has been focusing on "tackling the technological problem of running AI through mobile devices." To that end, it has acquired several AI-related startups, the last one occurring early last year when it purchased California-based WaveOne, which offers AI-powered video compression. <br/>
<br/>
According to a recent research note from Morgan Stanley, almost half of Apple's AI job posts have included the term "Deep learning," which relates to the algorithms used to power generative AI. <br/>
<br/>
Previous reports have suggested Apple has been testing its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-experimenting-with-chatgpt-tool/">"Ajax" large language model</a> (LLM) since early 2023, but in contrast to LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Apple's primary goal is to develop generative AI that works locally on-device, rather than being powered by cloud services in data centers.<br/>
<br/>
The challenge in achieving that aim involves optimizing the LLM while reducing its size, as well as heavier reliance on high-performance mobile hardware and faster Apple silicon chips. For example, Apple is said to be planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">significant upgrade</a> to the iPhone 16 microphone to improve a new AI-enhanced Siri experience.<br/>
<br/>
Just last month, Apple AI researchers said they have made a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-ai-researchers-run-llms-iphones/">key breakthrough</a> in deploying large language models (LLMs) on iPhones and other Apple devices with limited memory by inventing an innovative flash memory utilization technique.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be on schedule to announce a series of generative AI-based tools at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, when iOS 18 will be previewed. Morgan Stanley analysts expect the mobile software will be geared towards enabling generative AI and could include its voice assistant Siri being powered by an LLM.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ft-com/">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/apple-big-ai-push-startup-acquisitions/">Apple&#039;s Big AI Push Implied By Startup Acquisitions and Job Postings</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-big-ai-push-implied-by-startup-acquisitions-and-job-postings.2417281/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the Vision Pro does not launch until February 2, Apple today released visionOS 1.0.1 for the headset, according to developer <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolas09F9/status/1749976019929321720">Nicolás Álvarez</a>. It's unclear what's new in the software update, as Apple has yet to start publicly sharing visionOS release notes, but the version number suggests that it's likely a minor update with bug fixes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1744774909262483693"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said</a> that Apple would start shipping Vision Pro review units to selected media personnel following a January 23 meeting, so visionOS 1.0.1 should be available on those headsets as an immediate update out of the box. It could also be a day-one update for the public if initial Vision Pro units ship with visionOS 1.0 installed.<br/>
<br/>
visionOS 1.0.1 is the first-ever software update for the Vision Pro, and it has a build number of 21N311, according to Álvarez. Apple will likely unveil a larger visionOS 2.0 update with new features at WWDC in June.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced a new firmware update for the first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> and second-generation AirPods. The new firmware is the same 6A321 version that was released for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/airpods-3-firmware-6a321/">third-generation AirPods last week</a> and is up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2//">6A300 firmware</a> introduced last September.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/AirPods-Pro-Firmware-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2322" height="1306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-825981" /><br/>
Apple's AirPods firmware updates often do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software. For last week's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a> update with this firmware version, Apple listed only "bug fixes and other improvements."<br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your AirPods or ‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware version by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌AirPods to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has pivoted to simpler, less ambitious design for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a> in order to actually bring the vehicle to market, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-23/apple-car-ev-set-to-debut-in-2028-with-limited-autonomous-driving">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple initially wanted a driverless car with full autonomous capabilities, but it is now developing an electric vehicle with fewer features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774149" /><br/>
After abandoning the driverless plans, Apple aimed for a car with Level 4 autonomous functionality that would have allowed the car's system to take over driving in limited circumstances such as on highways, but even that was too ambitious. Apple is said to be focusing on driver-assistance features that are closer to how Tesla vehicles operate, and it will have a Level 2+ system. Level 2 autonomous driving includes steering and brake/acceleration support, but the driver remains in control of the car and must pay attention on the road.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the scaling back of the project, Apple's launch timeline for the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; has been adjusted. Apple wanted to introduce the car sometime around 2026, but Apple is now targeting a 2028 release at the earliest. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, this marks a "pivotal moment" for the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;. If the company is not able to deliver an electric vehicle with this feature set, executives may "seriously reconsider the project's existence."<br/>
<br/>
Since the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; was unveiled in 2014, the project has shifted and evolved several times. Rumors have at times suggested that Apple had scrapped a car altogether, focusing instead on an autonomous system, but it appears that Apple is sticking with plans to debut a full Apple-branded vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; project has been riddled with leadership changes and internal strife over the direction of development. Apple Watch chief Kevin Lynch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/kevin-lynch-apple-car-project/">took over the project</a>, and he worked with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> to adopt a new strategy after pressure from Apple's board. Apple is now meeting with potential partners in Europe to discuss the new plan.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-car-scaled-down-2028-launch/">Apple Car Autonomous Driving Scaled Down, Launch Planned for 2028</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-car-autonomous-driving-scaled-down-launch-planned-for-2028.2417226/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will begin accepting submissions for its next Swift Student Challenge on Monday, February 5, Apple said today in news provided to developers. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/swift-student-challenge-february-2024/">first announced plans</a> for an early 2024 launch in November, giving students plenty of time to prepare.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/swift-student-challenge-2024.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932478" /><br/>
The Swift Student Challenge tasks students with creating an innovative coding project using the Swift Playgrounds app. Apple plans to select 350 winners for this year's challenge, and there will be a category that recognizes a total of 50 Distinguished Winners for standout submissions.<br/>
<br/>
Distinguished Winners will be invited to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, where they will be able to connect with their peers and the Apple team, while all winners will be granted a free one-year membership in the Apple Developer program.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been holding an annual Swift Student Challenge for several years now, but it is typically announced when the dates for WWDC are announced, and past winners have been invited to attend the Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple says that this year's 50 Distinguished Winners will be invited to Cupertino "next summer."<br/>
<br/>
When February 5 rolls around, students will have three weeks to submit their app playgrounds to Apple. Apple judges entries on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and content of written responses explaining the project.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/swift-playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-swift-student-challenge-february-5/">Apple Launching 2024 Swift Student Challenge on February 5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launching-2024-swift-student-challenge-on-february-5.2417218/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today announced plans to add experimental generative AI features to the latest version of Chrome for Mac (M121), helping users organize tabs, create themes, and draft content.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/chrome-generative-ai.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932250" /><br/>
The Tab Organizer is able to suggest and create tab groups based on the tabs that are open, an option that can be accessed by right-clicking on a tab and choosing the Organize Similar Tabs option.<br/>
<br/>
With a text-to-image diffusion model, Chrome users can generate custom themes based on a subject, mood, visual style, and color. The "Create with AI" theme option is available under the Customize Chrome side panel.<br/>
<br/>
When writing something on the web, such as on a forum, Chrome will be able to help users generate content. The feature will let users right-click in any text box or field to access a "Help me write" option.<br/>
<br/>
The Tab Organizer and theme creator will be coming to U.S. Chrome users over the next few days, while the writing assistant will be available in next month's Chrome update. The experimental features can be enabled in the Settings section of Chrome by clicking on the three-dot menu and navigating to the Experimental AI page.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/">Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/chrome-mac-generative-ai/">Google Chrome for Mac Gets Generative AI Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-chrome-for-mac-gets-generative-ai-features.2417210/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[January 24 marks the 40th anniversary of Steve Jobs unveiling the Macintosh, the first successful mass-marketed computer with a graphical user interface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Classic-Mac-40-Years-Old-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932454" /><br/>
The original Macintosh popularized the computer mouse, allowing users to control an on-screen pointer. This point-and-click method of computer navigation was still a novel concept to most people at the time, as personal computers in this era typically had text-based command-line interfaces controlled with a keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
An excerpt from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/sites/mac/primary/docs/pr1.html">Apple's press release</a> in 1984:<blockquote>Users tell Macintosh what to do simply by moving a "mouse" — a small pointing device — to select among functions listed in menus and represented by pictorial symbols on the screen. Users are no longer forced to memorize the numerous and confusing keyboard commands of conventional computers. The result is radical ease of use and a significant reduction in learning time. In effect, the Macintosh is a desk-top appliance offering users increased utility and creativity with simplicity.</blockquote>Apple said the Macintosh typically took "only a few hours to learn," and it touted what are now basic computer features, such as a desktop with icons, the ability to use multiple programs in windows, drop-down menus, and copy and paste. <br/>
<br/>
A quote from Jobs in Apple's press release:<blockquote>Macintosh easily fits on a desk, both in terms of its style of operation and its physical design. It takes up about the same amount of desk space as a piece of paper. With Macintosh, the computer is an aid to spontaneity and originality, not an obstacle. It allows ideas and relationships to be viewed in new ways. Macintosh enhances not just productivity, but also creativity.</blockquote>Pricing for the original Macintosh started at &#36;2,495, equivalent to over &#36;7,000 today. Key specs and features included an 8 MHz processor, 128 KB of RAM, a 400 KB floppy disk drive for storage, and serial ports for connecting a printer and other accessories.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has Apple's M2 Mac mini on sale in all three configurations, starting at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BSHGHGXR%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;499.99</strong></a> for the 256GB model, down from &#36;599.00. You'll need to clip an on-page coupon for all of these deals, and after you do you'll find the final discounted prices at the checkout screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/mac-mini-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905646" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Apple updated the Mac mini one year ago this month, introducing the M2 and M2 Pro chips to the lineup. Unless you have Prime, delivery estimates have begun slipping into late January for these computers, but all models still have plenty of stock available on Amazon at these discounted prices.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BSHGHGXR%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;99 OFF</div>M2 Mac mini (256GB) for &#36;499.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
You can also get the 512GB M2 Mac mini on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BSHGTPMV%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;675.99</strong></a> with the on-page coupon, down from &#36;799.00. This is a new all-time low price on this model of the Mac mini, and there's an estimated January 30 delivery date if ordered today.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BSHGTPMV%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;123 OFF</div>M2 Mac mini (512GB) for &#36;675.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Lastly, Amazon has the higher-end M2 Pro Mac mini for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BSHFS6XX%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,149.99</strong></a> with the on-page coupon, down from &#36;1,299.00. This model doesn't go on sale as often as the M2 models, and this is a solid second-best price on the computer.<br/>

This is about &#36;1 higher than the previous all-time low price for the accessory on Amazon, so it's still a great deal. The MagSafe Duo Charger can simultaneously charge an iPhone via MagSafe and an Apple Watch.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has until March 6 to fully comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act, which among other things will require the company to allow iPhone users to install apps outside of the App Store. With the deadline for this regulation fast approaching, it is likely that Apple will begin preparing for these changes with iOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
The first iOS 17.4 beta is expected to be released as early as this week, although it is unclear if the app-related changes will be rolled out for testing immediately, or held for later beta versions. Apple is expected to add support for both third-party app stores and app sideloading on the iPhone for users in <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles_en">EU countries</a>, including Austria, Belgium, Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and others.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-says-sideloading-makes-android-less-safe/">strongly</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-files-legal-challenge-against-eu/">opposed</a> the Digital Markets Act and app sideloading over the past few years, citing privacy and security risks for customers. At a tech conference in 2021, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/tim-cook-vivatech-conference-interview/">Apple CEO Tim Cook said</a> app sideloading "would destroy the security of the iPhone and a lot of the privacy initiatives that we've built into the App Store."<br/>
<br/>
Apple will likely do the minimum required to comply with the Digital Markets Act, which may lead to several limitations and guardrails surrounding third-party app stores and app sideloading on the iPhone. We've seen Apple do similar with legal compliance in the U.S., where it recently allowed developers to direct customers to payment methods outside of the ‌App Store‌, but is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/">still collecting up to a 27% commission</a> and has several rules.<br/>
<br/>
There are other changes coming to the iPhone in Europe as a result of regulatory pressures. Earlier this week, the European Commission announced that Apple has promised to give third-party payment apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/apple-offers-to-open-nfc-in-europe/">access to the iPhone's NFC chip in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway</a>, which should result in more competition for Apple Pay. It's unclear when Apple will implement this change, but it is likely further away than app sideloading.<br/>
<br/>
We will be digging into iOS 17.4 as soon as it is released, so stay tuned for a closer look at any new features and code changes.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/ios-17-4-coming-soon/">iOS 17.4 Coming Soon as iPhone App Sideloading Deadline in EU Nears</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-coming-soon-as-iphone-app-sideloading-deadline-in-eu-nears.2417196/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung is striving to beat Apple to launch non-invasive blood glucose monitoring technology, as well as continuous blood pressure tracking features, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-22/samsung-races-apple-on-noninvasive-glucose-checks-blood-pressure-monitoring?"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/galaxy-watch6-models.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904451" /><br/>
The efforts are part of the company's wider push to offer more health capabilities, embodied by the recent announcement of the Galaxy Ring, which touts activity and sleep tracking, with more health features set to arrive later. In a new interview, Samsung's mobile digital health chief Hon Pak said:<blockquote>If we can do continuous blood pressure and glucose, we're in a whole different ballgame. I think that's where everyone is trying to get to. We're putting significant investment toward that.<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
We are looking at everything from miniaturization to the various different technology platforms that can do some type of glucose monitoring or anything in between.</blockquote>Pak declined to comment on a time frame for launching either of the features in specific Samsung devices, but believes that non-invasive glucose monitoring technology could come to market in some form within five years. Current blood glucose monitoring systems usually requires pricking the skin, but Apple has reportedly been working on a unique non-invasive approach for over a decade. The company is believed to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/22/apple-blood-glucose-monitoring-technology/">made major progress with the technology</a>, increasing pressure on rivals to provide competing features.<br/>
<br/>
While Samsung smartwatches already offer the ability to determine a user's blood pressure, the capability is not constant and requires specific calibration with a separate blood pressure monitor. Apple is purportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/2024-apple-watch-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea/">planning to add hypertension detection</a> to the Apple Watch later this year with no calibration requirement, but it will not provide exact readings, instead simply informing users that they may have elevated blood pressure. <br/>
<br/>
Like Apple, Samsung is also reportedly exploring adding health sensors to future versions of its earbuds, such as body temperature and heart rate monitoring, since the ear is a closer pathway to the heart than the wrist. Health information from the ear could be combined with data already collected from the wrist for even greater accuracy.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health-technologies/">Health Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/samsung-racing-to-beat-apple/">Samsung Racing to Beat Apple to Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Technology</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-racing-to-beat-apple-to-non-invasive-blood-glucose-monitoring-technology.2417191/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Music to Pay Artists Up to 10% More Royalties for Spatial Audio Content</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has introduced royalty incentives to encourage music artists and record labels to publish tracks in Spatial Audio.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/apple-music-spatial-audio-ad.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804348" /><br/>
In an update sent to partners on Monday seen by <em><a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/apple-music-to-pay-artists-up-to-10-higher-royalties-for-music-available-in-spatial-audio/">Music Business Worldwide</a></em>, Apple said it will pay up to 10% more in royalties for Spatial Audio. <br/>
<br/>
The news follows a <em>Bloomberg</em> report in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-to-incentivize-spatial-audio/">December</a> that Apple would this year begin prioritizing streams of songs mixed in Dolby Atmos technology in its streaming calculations.<br/>
<br/>
Listeners do not have to listen to the Spatial Audio version of a song for artists to be eligible for the added benefits, with the availability of tracks in Dolby Atmos being sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/22/apple-music-spatial-audio-bonus/">9to5Mac</a></em>, Apple says the 10% bonus is a reward for artists delivering the content, and also compensation to recognize the additional time and effort required to mix in Dolby Atmos.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us">Philips Hue parent company Signify</a> is announcing several product updates today, with new products, colorways, and U.S. availability for some devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/philips-hue-dymara.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932253" /><br/>
A new wall light, the Philips Hue Dymera, offers two beams of light that shine both up and down. The light, which supports both white shades and color, can illuminate large surfaces and is able to be used both indoors and out.<br/>
<br/>
The Philips Hue Pendant Cord can be used with Hue Filament bulbs or the Hue Ellipse. 3D printed from 55 percent bio-circular material, the pendant cord comes in either black and white and can be purchased in two sizes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hue-pendant.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932254" /><br/>
For those with the Hue Perifo track lighting, there are new connector options. The T Connector allows rails to run in three directions, while the Flexible Connector allows rails to run in any direction and beyond 90-degree angles.<br/>
<br/>

The Hue Being Ceiling Light is now available in black and white, rather than just the aluminum color. The Hue Being supports 50,000 shades of warm-to-cool white light.<br/>
<br/>

Signify is selling the Hue Go Portable Table Lamp in updated colors that include black with an orange grip and white with a teal grip. The silicone grips are designed to make it easier to move the lamp from place to place. The lamp is able to charge in three to four hours with the included charging stand, and the battery lasts for up to 48 hours.<br/>
<br/>

The Hue line now includes the Philips Hue Secure Floodlight Camera (U.S. availability is new) and the Hue Secure Camera Starter Kit. The indoor/outdoor Starter Kit has a wired camera, two Philips Hue bulbs, a Hue Bridge, and two Philips Hue Secure contact sensors that let users know when a door is opened or closed. The Floodlight Camera is meant to be used outdoors, and it offers both recording functionality and colored/white Hue light.<br/>
<br/>

New app updates are expected for the Security Center of the Hue app in the first half of 2024. Signify is improving security push notifications and the event timeline, as well as options for automatic light and sound alarms when motion is detected.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Vision Pro headset comes in a very large box that uses the company's typically distinctive design language, <em>MacRumors</em> has seen. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Box-and-Ref-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932237" /><em>Render of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> box based on official materials.</em></div><br/>
The packaging, seen by <em>MacRumors</em> in an Apple employee training video, mirrors the design used across many of its other devices that come in boxes that slide open from the top. Those hoping for an exciting new packaging design for the new product line will be disappointed; the top of the cuboid box features a front view of the Vision Pro headset, while each of the longer sides is simply emblazoned with gray Apple "Vision Pro" text.<br/>
<br/>
While the design itself may be fairly unremarkable, the box's size is immense, almost filling the entire lap of a customer. This is because it contains a Solo Knit Band, a Dual Loop Band, a Light Seal, two Light Seal cushions, a cover, an external battery pack, a USB-C charging cable, a power adapter, a polishing cloth, and the Vision Pro headset itself, necessitating an extremely large receptacle. Until now, the size and design of the box has been unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who purchase a Vision Pro in-store are set to have their device's various sized parts boxed up with the headset itself by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> employees. The device is arranged lengthways in the oblong box and comes pre-attached to the Solo Knit Band. Even though the Vision Pro's box is much larger than that of devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, which have a fabric handle on the top to help transport it, there is no grab-handle on the top of Vision Pro's box.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is set to launch on Friday, February 2. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1749199540723535949?s=20">yesterday said</a> that the Vision Pro, like the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, will be accompanied by a commemorative shopping bag for those who buy or pick-up the device in-store. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/heres-what-apple-vision-pros-box-looks-like/">Here&#039;s What Apple Vision Pro&#039;s Huge Box Looks Like</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-what-apple-vision-pros-huge-box-looks-like.2417144/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released iOS 17.3, a major update to the iOS operating system that adds Stolen Device Protection, collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists, and a handful of other interesting features.<br/>
<br/>

In this guide, we've rounded up everything new in the iOS 17.3 update.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="stolen_device_protection">Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
Earlier this year, there were news reports about a series of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> thefts where the thief spied on a victim to learn an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s passcode before going on to steal the device, leading to drained bank accounts, stolen passwords, and an untraceable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926120" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
As a solution, Apple included Stolen Device Protection in iOS 17.3 to add extra security. Should a thief get their hands on both your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and your passcode, Stolen Device Protection prevents total catastrophe. With Stolen Device Protection enabled, accessing passwords in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain, turning off Lost Mode, erasing content, and making purchases in Safari requires biometric authentication with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Actions like changing an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> password require &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; <em>and</em> have a one-hour security delay. So if you (or someone else) tried to change your &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; login information, you would need to authenticate with &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; and then wait an hour before the password could be updated. These wait periods are not required when you are in a trusted location like home or work.<br/>
<br/>
Here are actions that require biometric authentication when Stolen Device Protection is activated:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Viewing/using passwords or passkeys saved in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Keychain</li><br/>
 <li>Applying for a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></li><br/>
 <li>Viewing an &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; virtual card</li><br/>
 <li>Turning off Lost Mode</li><br/>
 <li>Erasing all content and settings</li><br/>
 <li>Taking certain Apple Cash and Savings actions in Wallet</li><br/>
 <li>Using payment methods saved in Safari</li><br/>
 <li>Using your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to set up a new device</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Note that these actions do not have a passcode backup, so you can't use a passcode to skirt &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj;. Actions that require biometric authentication and have a one-hour security delay include the following:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Changing your &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; password</li><br/>
 <li>Updating select &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; account security settings, including adding or removing a trusted device, trusted phone number, Recovery Key, or Recovery Contact</li><br/>
 <li>Changing your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; passcode</li><br/>
 <li>Adding or removing &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj;</li><br/>
 <li>Turning off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a></li><br/>
 <li>Turning off Stolen Device Protection</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Stolen Device Protection is available on all iPhones that are able to run <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, which includes the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS and newer. It is an opt-in feature that can be turned on in the Settings app by going to &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; &amp; Passcode and toggling on Stolen Device Protection.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="collaborative_apple_music_playlists">Collaborative Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
Apple introduced collaborative &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Playlists in iOS 17.3. With this feature, you can take any of your existing playlists or create a new one and then invite others to join in to add songs and listen to the playlist. You can invite friends, family members, and others who share your musical preferences, and there doesn't appear to be a limit on how many people can contribute.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="5484" height="3085" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918890" /><br/>
We have a <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/pl.u-kaJH7JG97e?a=join&amp;it=zr6IZVEGZ6tVoblq">MacRumors collaborative music playlist</a> available for those who want to join in and share music with other MacRumors readers.<br/>
<br/>
To use the collaboration feature, go to a playlist in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app and then tap on the person icon. You will be able to generate a link that you can send to others, and everyone who is invited can access the playlist. There is an option to approve each person that joins, and leaving this off just opens it up to anyone with the link.<br/>
<br/>
The person who created the playlist can remove people, remove songs, and turn off collaboration at any time.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="collaborative_playlist_emoji_reactions">Collaborative Playlist Emoji Reactions</h2><br/>
Apple in iOS 17.3 also added a neat emoji reaction feature that allows listeners to add an emoji to any song that's playing to express their feelings about it. There are standard quick access emoji options like a heart and thumbs up, but with the "+" button, any emoji can be added.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926541" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/apple-music-collaborative-playlist-emoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
When you're listening to a song in the playlist that has emoji reactions added by people who have collaborated on a playlist, those emoji animate as the song begins to play.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="airplay_2_in_hotels">AirPlay 2 in Hotels</h2><br/>
Select hotels now support streaming content from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac directly to an AirPlay-compatible hotel. The feature is designed to allow you to watch content on streaming services without having to log in to a hotel TV with your credentials.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airplay-hotels.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898340" /><br/>
<h2 id="applecare">AppleCare</h2><br/>
In the Settings app under General, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> and Warranty section displays the &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; coverage for all devices signed in with your &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="crash_detection">Crash Detection</h2><br/>
Apple has further optimized the Crash Detection feature that is available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models. Apple has been continually tweaking Crash Detection to prevent it from activating during activities that cause movement similar to a car crash.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="tv_show_and_movie_wishlists">TV Show and Movie Wishlists</h2><br/>
With iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2, Apple stopped allowing TV shows and movies to be purchased with the iTunes Store app. iTunes Store wishlists were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/apple-removes-tv-show-movie-wishlists/">an unfortunate casualty</a> of the transition, and they became accessible.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/itunes-movies-wishlist-ios-17-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931842" /><br/>
Users who were upset about losing carefully curated wishlists can now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/itunes-movies-tv-show-wishlists-ios-17-3/">access that information</a> again in the iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 updates. Apple has added a new "Go to Wish List" option so users can copy down their movie and TV show watch lists.<br/>
