		<description><![CDATA[In the U.S., the Apple Card offers a high-yield savings account option, allowing you to earn far more interest on your money compared to the average bank's basic savings account. Apple's account offers an APY of 4.1% as of writing, and while that is a competitive rate, it is not the absolute best offer available at this time.<br/>

<br/>
Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/">is now &#36;1 million</a>, up from &#36;250,000.<br/>
<br/>
When the account first became available, Apple and Goldman Sachs offered an APY of 4.15%, but the rate has fluctuated in line with U.S. Federal Reserve benchmark rate changes. The rate increased three times, reaching a peak of 4.5% in early 2024, but it has since been cut three times and has stood at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/10/apple-card-savings-account-rate-cut/">4.1% since early October</a>. Apple has yet to change the rate after the Federal Reserve's latest rate cut in early November.<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs reportedly plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">end its consumer lending partnership with Apple</a>, but it is unclear if this will have any impact on Apple Card holders. JPMorgan, owner of Chase Bank, reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/17/jpmorgan-chase-apple-card-talks/">could take over</a> as Apple's financial partner.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/27/apple-card-savings-rate-comparison/">Here&#039;s How the Apple Card Savings Account&#039;s Interest Rate Compares to Major Competitors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-how-the-apple-card-savings-accounts-interest-rate-compares-to-major-competitors.2444119/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We've been focusing on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/apple-black-friday-deals-now-2024/">deals on physical products</a> over the past few weeks, but Black Friday is also a great time of year to purchase a streaming membership. Some of the biggest services have great discounts for new and select returning members this week, including Disney+, Hulu, Paramount+, and Peacock.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/new-streaming-black-friday.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979917" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Disney+ and Hulu</h2><br/>
Starting with the <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/153062/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2FGMA"><strong>Disney+ and Hulu bundle</strong></a>, you can get Hulu (with ads) and Disney+ (with ads) for &#36;2.99 per month for an entire year, down from the regular &#36;10.99 per month price. This offer is valid for new and eligible returning Hulu/Disney+ subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/153062/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2FGMA"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">72% OFF PER MONTH</div>Disney+ and Hulu Bundle for &#36;2.99/month</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
As usual, this offer will revert to the regular &#36;10.99 per month price (or then-current regular monthly price) at the end of your first year. Shoppers have until 11:59 p.m. PST on December 2 to take advantage of this offer.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if you just want Hulu (with ads), you can get it for &#36;0.99 per month for a year, down from &#36;9.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Paramount+</h2><br/>
You can get either <a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/153062/175360/3065?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"><strong>Paramount+ Essential or Paramount+ with Showtime</strong></a> for &#36;2.99 per month for your first two months this Black Friday.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models include a multi-functional Double Tap gesture that you might not know about or haven't yet got around to trying. Here's everything Double Tap can do, and how you can make the most of it on your Apple Watch. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/double-tap.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979840" /><br/>
Double Tap is a gesture-based feature for Apple Watch models that lets you control watch functions by tapping your thumb and index finger together twice. The feature aims to make it easier to navigate the Apple Watch when you have only one hand free, like when you're walking a dog, carrying groceries, or holding a cup of coffee.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What Double Tap Can Do</h2><br/>
Double Tap's functionality is pretty simple. You raise your watch to wake, and then you double tap your thumb and index finger together to control what's happening on the screen of your watch. <br/>
<br/>
By default, Double Tap selects the primary button in whatever app you're in. So for example, if you get a call, you can double tap to answer, and use it to hang up when you're done. Likewise, if you're watching/listening to media, you can pause it and resume it (or skip). You can also use the gesture from your Apple Watch face to navigate through your Smart Stack, widget by widget.<br/>
<br/>
Some other use cases: If you've set a timer, double-tapping will pause it. Performing the gesture again will resume the countdown, and when the timer goes off, a double-tap will stop it. Similarly, you can use it to do other everyday things like snooze alarms, trigger the Camera Remote app's shutter button, and dismiss notifications.<br/>
<br/>
In watchOS 11, Double Tap can also be used to scroll through navigable content in any Apple app, including the Weather and Messages. You can even use a double tap to dismiss a timer that has ended.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-watchos-11-double-tap.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979841" /><br/>
As you might expect, the gesture is also set up to assume your other hand is preoccupied. If you receive a text, for instance, a double tap lets you reply with a voice message, while another double tap sends the message.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a rundown of everything you can do with Double Tap:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and then Double Tap again to scroll through widgets one by one.</li><br/>
 	<li>Answer phone or FaceTime calls.</li><br/>
 	<li>Hang up phone or FaceTime calls.</li><br/>
 	<li>When you get an iMessage, Double Tap to view it, and then Double Tap again if you need to scroll.</li><br/>
 	<li>Reply to a Message using dictation and then send it with Double Tap.</li><br/>
 	<li>Act on notifications - Apple says a Double Tap on an incoming notification will activate the primary action, such as snoozing a reminder or replying to a message.</li><br/>
 	<li>Pause, resume, and end a timer.</li><br/>
 	<li>Stop and resume the stopwatch.</li><br/>
 	<li>Snooze an alarm.</li><br/>
 	<li>Play and pause music, podcasts, or audiobooks (or skip a track, depending on settings).</li><br/>
 	<li>Change to the Elevation view in the Compass app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Start or stop automatic Workout reminders when a workout is detected.</li><br/>
<li>Take a photo with the Camera Remote.</li><br/>
<li>Record a voice memo in the Voice Memo app.</li><br/>
<li>Change Flashlight modes.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
In the Apple Watch Settings app, under Gestures, you can opt to change the playback option from play/pause to skip, and the Smart Stack option from Advance (swaps through the widgets) to Select (opens a widget's associated app). If you have Apple Vision Pro, you'll also find an option to ignore double tap gestures when you're wearing the headset.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Set Up Double Tap</h2><br/>
If Double Tap is disabled on your watch, you will need to enable it manually for it to work. This can be done from your wrist or in the Watch app on iPhone, and both menus include options to customize Media Playback and Smart Stack functionality. <br/>
<br/>
Note that to enable Double Tap, setup involves giving watchOS permission to disable some Accessibility options, including Assistive Touch, Zoom with Hand Gestures, VoiceOver with Hand Gestures, and Quick Actions. If Double Tap is enabled but is not working for you, disabling it and then turning it back on can help in some circumstances. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>On Apple Watch:</h3><br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Double Tap</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Double Tap</strong> on the next screen.</li><br/>
<li>If prompted, tap <strong>Turn off Accessibility Features</strong> at the bottom of the on-screen alert.</li><br/>
<li>Choose your preferred setting for "Playback" (<strong>Play/Pause</strong> or <strong>Skip</strong>) and "Smart Stack" (<strong>Advance</strong> or <strong>Select</strong>).</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/enable-double-tap2.jpg" alt="settings" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915348" /><br/>
<br/>
<h3>On iPhone:</h3><br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Watch</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>With the "My Watch" tab selected, tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Double Tap</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Double Tap</strong> on the next screen.</li><br/>
<li>If prompted, tap <strong>Turn off Accessibility Features</strong> in the on-screen alert.</li><br/>
<li>Choose your preferred setting for "Playback" (<strong>Play/Pause</strong> or <strong>Skip</strong>) and "Smart Stack" (<strong>Advance</strong> or <strong>Select</strong>).</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/enable-double-tap1.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915349" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple says Double Tap is enabled by the S9 chip's faster Neural Engine, which is why the feature is only available on the Series 9 and later and the Ultra 2. Apple said it developed an algorithm that detects the "unique signature" of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb are tapped together.<br/>

If you own an earlier Apple Watch model that doesn't support Double Tap, you can always try a similar but more limited accessibility feature called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-hand-gestures-control-apple-watch/">AssistiveTouch</a>, which is available on the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/double-tap/">Double Tap</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/using-the-double-tap-feature-on-apple-watch/">Do More Single-Handedly With Double Tap on Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/do-more-single-handedly-with-double-tap-on-apple-watch.2444105/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple experienced minimal iPhone growth in 2024 despite a significant rebound in the global smartphone market, according to <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52757624">new data published by IDC</a>. Worldwide smartphone shipments increased 6.2% to reach 1.24 billion units, but iPhone shipments grew by just 0.4% during the same period.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-16-Apple-Store.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976828" /><br/>
The tepid performance underlines Apple's challenges in key markets like China, where domestic rivals are gaining ground through aggressive pricing and technological innovation. Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi and Huawei are investing heavily in hardware and software development as well as custom processor designs, with Huawei recently launching its new Mate 70 phone featuring its own home-grown chips.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Android device makers collectively drove the market's recovery, achieving 7.6% growth mostly through strong performance in emerging markets across Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. These manufacturers appear to have succeeded by offering more affordable devices, with an average selling price of &#36;295 compared to Apple's &#36;1,000-plus premium iPhone positioning.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the slower growth, Apple maintained its position as the industry's profit leader through its premium pricing strategy. According to IDC, the Apple's prospects may improve in 2025, with a forecast of 3.1% growth for iOS devices compared to 1.7% for Android smartphones.<br/>
<br/>

Overall, the broader smartphone market's recovery was driven by pent-up demand for device upgrades in regions with lower smartphone penetration. However, IDC analysts noted that even heavily marketed features like generative AI have failed to significantly impact consumer demand or drive early upgrades, which doesn't bode well for the impact of Apple Intelligence on iPhone sales going into 2025.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/idc/">IDC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/27/iphone-sales-stall-global-market-idc/">iPhone Sales Stall Despite Global Smartphone Market Recovery</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-sales-stall-despite-global-smartphone-market-recovery.2444103/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Has Scaled Back (PRODUCT)RED Color Option Over Past Few Years</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Since 2006, Apple has partnered with the (RED) brand to raise money for The Global Fund, an organization that aims to combat diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in Africa. Through this partnership, Apple has long offered a <a href="https://www.apple.com/product-red/">(PRODUCT)RED color option</a> for some products, but it has scaled back this effort over the past few years.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/PRODUCT-RED-Products.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979760" /><br/>
The only current-generation (PRODUCT)RED product that Apple sells new is the iPhone SE 3, which is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/iphone-se-4-expected-to-launch-in-march/">discontinued in March</a>. Beyond that, its only remaining (PRODUCT)RED products are the iPhone 14 and a handful of older iPhone cases.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not offer any iPhone 15 models in (PRODUCT)RED, and that trend has continued with iPhone 16 models so far. It did offer the aluminum Apple Watch Series 9 in (PRODUCT)RED last year, but that device has since been discontinued, and the color option is not available for the Apple Watch Series 10. Apple also discontinued the (PRODUCT)RED version of the Sport Band that was available alongside the Series 9.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Apple has used different branding for newer Beats products available in red, such as Statement Red and Transparent Red.<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean Apple is slowly phasing out the (PRODUCT)RED brand? It's hard to say for sure yet, as the color could return from time to time more selectively. The number of products available in (PRODUCT)RED has certainly dwindled over the past two years, though, so the future of the color seems to be in jeopardy.<br/>
<br/>
Apple continues to support The Global Fund through its annual Apple Pay donation program, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/26/apple-pay-world-aids-day-donation-campaign/">returns from November 29 through December 8</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/productred/">(PRODUCT)RED</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/26/apple-has-scaled-back-productred/">Apple Has Scaled Back (PRODUCT)RED Color Option Over Past Few Years</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-has-scaled-back-product-red-color-option-over-past-few-years.2444052/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple said its donation this year will be capped at &#36;3 million.<br/>

The Global Fund aims to combat diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria throughout the developing world. Apple says its donation to the organization will continue to "help fund critical health programs that save lives."<br/>
<br/>
Apple runs this donation campaign ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1 each year.<br/>

Apple has supported The Global Fund for 18 years through its partnership with the (RED) brand, co-founded by U2 singer Bono. Apple offers some products in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/product-red/">(PRODUCT)RED</a> color, and a portion of the proceeds from every one of these products sold by Apple goes to The Global Fund.

		<description><![CDATA[In late 2023, Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed what next-generation CarPlay could look like</a> in its vehicles, with a pair of images showing a custom instrument cluster and more. However, the luxury automaker has yet to release any vehicles that support the software nearly a year later, and it sounds like it still has no imminent plans to do so.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1540" height="854" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927564" /><br/>
A spokesperson for Porsche today informed <em>MacRumors</em> that the automaker plans to maintain its current level of CarPlay integration in the "near term." Porsche supports standard CarPlay, and while some of its vehicles like the Taycan offer additional features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/17/porsche-taycan-apple-maps-ev-routing/">EV routing in Apple Maps</a>, that is not next-generation CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
Aston Martin also previewed its next-generation CarPlay design alongside Porsche last year, but it has yet to release any vehicles that support the system.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's website continues to say that the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay support will "arrive in 2024," but no vehicles support the software yet. Apple and automakers have just over a month remaining to meet that 2024 timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first previewed next-generation CarPlay <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">in June 2022</a>, promising deeper integration with the instrument cluster and climate controls, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, a dedicated FM radio app, widgets, and more. The interface can be tailored to each specific vehicle model and automaker's brand identity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927534" /><br/>
When it unveiled next-generation CarPlay, Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Nearly two and a half years have gone by since Apple shared that list, however, so it is unclear if it remains fully accurate.<br/>
<br/>
It is still very possible that next-generation CarPlay ends up launching this December, and recent activity suggests that Apple is still making preparations. Earlier this month, a few <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/ios-18-2-beta-next-generation-carplay-icons/">redesigned next-generation CarPlay icons</a> appeared in iOS 18.2 beta code, and Apple filed to protect its next-generation CarPlay designs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/next-generation-carplay-images-in-eu/">in the European Union</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been adding next-generation CarPlay references to iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/">since iOS 17</a>, so it is unclear what the minimum iOS version requirement will be for the system. In any case, we expect iOS 18.2 to be released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/ios-18-2-potential-release-date/">on December 9</a>. Hopefully, Apple will finally announce next-generation CarPlay availability details at some point next month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/26/porsche-no-next-generation-carplay-in-near-term/">Porsche Still Has No Imminent Plans to Launch Next-Generation CarPlay Despite 2023 Preview</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/porsche-still-has-no-imminent-plans-to-launch-next-generation-carplay-despite-2023-preview.2444039/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announcements-m4-imac-mac-mini-macbook-pro/">fall 2024 Mac announcements</a> have included new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models, all of which debuted with variants of Apple's M4 chip. Apple intends to update the rest of its Mac lineup with M4 series processors over the next 12 months, which will make it the first time that Apple has used the same chip generation across all of its Macs. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-M4-Pro-vs-M4-Max-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973089" /><br/>
This means we can expect new M4 versions of MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro models next year. Here's what the latest rumors tell us about when each machine will launch, and what kinds of upgrades we can expect for them.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M4 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m3-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950298" /><br/>
Apple in March 2024 launched updated 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models equipped with Apple's M3 chip, and the company will soon start production of M4 versions ahead of an early 2025 launch, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/09/when-to-expect-m4-macbook-air-mac-studio-mac-pro/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. There are no new design changes planned for the ‌MacBook Air‌ models, and the focus will be on the M4 chip, but the base model will come with at least 16GB of RAM, after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-ram/">updated the base M3 model to 16GB</a>, up from 8GB. An M4 MacBook Air could also feature a new 12MP Centre Stage camera with Desk View support, an improvement over the current 1080p FaceTime HD camera, given that both the new M4 iMac and M4 MacBook Pro models also debuted with the upgraded camera. The ‌machines will arrive next year between January and March. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>M4 Mac Studio</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-Mac-Studio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2672" height="1503" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946114" /><br/>
Apple plans to refresh the Mac Studio after the M4 MacBook Air has been released in early 2025. It will be equipped with a variation of the M4 processor – likely an M4 Ultra or Max chip. The current model comes in both M2 Max and M2 Ultra variants. Given that the Mac mini with M4 Pro chip and Apple's latest high-end MacBook Pro models include Thunderbolt 5 ports, it's certain that the Mac Studio will also adopt them. Mark Gurman claims that the ‌Mac Studio‌ was on track to be updated alongside the ‌MacBook Air‌, but it is now going to see a refresh <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/m4-macbook-air-production-beginning-soon/">between March and June</a>. In previous reports, he said the ‌Mac Studio‌ would come out in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-studio-m4-mac-pro-2025/">mid-2025</a>, so it is unclear what has changed. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>M4 Mac Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-Mac-Pro-Feature-Warm-2.jpg" alt="" width="2672" height="1503" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948229" /><br/>
Apple last updated the Mac Pro in June 2023, adding an M2 Ultra chip and officially completing the transition away from Intel chips. Apple will refresh the Mac Pro in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/m4-macbook-air-production-beginning-soon/">summer of 2025</a>, according to Mark Gurman. Like the Mac Studio, the next Mac Pro will skip the M3 series. Instead it will be equipped with the highest-end version of the M4 chip, codenamed "Hidra." Based on the description of the chip, it could be positioned as an "Ultra" or "Extreme" chip. Gurman has said the M4 Ultra chip in the next Mac Pro will "probably" have up to a 32-core CPU and up to an 80-core GPU, which would be double the M4 Max's up to 16-core CPU and up to 40-core GPU. The next Mac Pro is expected to feature Thunderbolt 5 ports. It could also support up to 512GB of memory, a notable increase over the current 192GB limit. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>M4 Series Performance</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-chip-series-3up.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974019" /><br/>
Like the M3, the M4 is built on a 3nm process, but with enhancements from Apple supplier TSMC for improved performance and power efficiency. The M4 also includes an improved Neural Engine that fuels accelerated AI workloads. Apple says it is the company's most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of 38 trillion operations per second.<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench 6 benchmark results have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/m4-max-chip-geekbench-benchmark-results/">surfaced</a> for Apple's new M4 Pro and M4 Max chips in the new Mac mini and MacBook Pro models, so we have some indications of performance. In the new Mac mini and MacBook Pro models, the highest-end variants of the M4 Pro and M4 Max both outperform the highest-end M2 Ultra chip in the Mac Studio and Mac Pro: The M4 Max is up to 25% faster than the M2 Ultra in terms of peak multi-core CPU performance. M4 Pro's impressive performance gains are partly due to the M3 Pro being a very minor upgrade over the M2 Pro chip last year. Meanwhile, the M4 Max is up to 20% faster than the M4 Pro when it comes to peak multi-core CPU performance. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of graphics performance, Geekbench 6 results <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/m4-pro-m4-max-graphics-benchmarks/">indicate</a> that the M4 Pro and M4 Max are up to around 40% and 25% faster for graphics than the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, respectively. Notably, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the highest-end M4 Max with a 40-core GPU has up to 85% as fast graphics as the Mac Studio with the highest-end M2 Ultra chip with a 76-core GPU, even though it has 36 fewer GPU cores.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/26/when-to-expect-m4-macbook-air-mac-studio-mac-pro-2/">When to Expect New M4 MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-to-expect-new-m4-macbook-air-mac-studio-and-mac-pro-models.2444033/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brazil's antitrust regulator has ordered Apple to remove App Store restrictions on third-party payment systems and allow developers to market alternative payment options for in-app purchases. Apple has 20 days to comply or face daily fines of &#36;43,000.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/app-store-awards-2022.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876046" /><br/>
The ruling by the Council for Economic Defense (Cade) comes in response to a 2022 complaint filed by MercadoLibre, Latin America's largest e-commerce platform. The company accused Apple of abusing its monopolistic position by requiring developers to use Apple's own payment system and preventing them from redirecting users to external payment options.<br/>
<br/>
Under the new requirements, Apple must permit app developers to implement tools allowing customers to make purchases outside the Apple ecosystem. This includes enabling the use of hyperlinks to external websites and allowing developers to market third-party products and services within their apps.<br/>
<br/>
The Brazilian case mirrors similar antitrust concerns raised in the EU. In March 2024, the European Commission <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">fined Apple €1.8 billion</a> (&#36;1.95 billion) for restricting music streaming apps from informing users about cheaper subscription options outside the App Store. That ruling followed a complaint by Spotify in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
MercadoLibre's original complaint, filed in both Brazil and Mexico, argued that Apple's restrictions particularly harm smaller competitors while benefiting large integrated digital companies. The e-commerce giant's SVP general counsel, Jacobo Cohen Imach, criticized Apple's practices as creating an "artificial tilt towards integrated ecosystems."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is experiencing challenges as it attempts to launch Apple Intelligence in China, with regulators cautioning that foreign companies face a "difficult and long process" for approval unless they partner with local firms, according to a new <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8ce6715a-0614-4c8b-9bc2-5f4174519f9f">Financial Times</a></em> report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963902" /><br/>
A senior official at the Cyberspace Administration of China told the <em>FT</em> that foreign device makers would find a "simple and straightforward approval process" if they utilize already-approved large language models (LLMs) from Chinese companies, rather than attempting to implement their own AI systems.<br/>
<br/>
The regulatory situation has reportedly prompted Apple to engage in discussions with several Chinese tech companies, including search giant Baidu, ByteDance, and AI startup Moonshot, to potentially power Apple Intelligence features in devices sold in mainland China.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook arrived in China on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/tim-cook-visits-china-third-time-this-year/">Monday</a> to attend a CEO summit with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, in what could be an attempt by Cook to personally navigate the complex regulatory landscape. During his previous visit to Beijing, Cook acknowledged the specific regulatory requirements, stating that Apple was "working hard" to bring Apple Intelligence to Chinese consumers.<br/>
<br/>
The company has been gradually rolling out Apple Intelligence features in the US and elsewhere since October, with things like Writing Tools and enhanced Siri using a combination of on-device processing and its Private Cloud Compute servers, along with OpenAI's ChatGPT for more complex queries. But if Apple can't secure approval for its own AI models in China, it may need to rely on Chinese partners' LLMs to host AI features on devices sold there.<br/>
<br/>
According to JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, the regulatory uncertainty could delay the launch of Apple Intelligence in China until "well into the second half of 2025" or later, unless Apple adopts a flexible approach involving multiple Chinese partnerships to expedite approval.<br/>
<br/>
China represents 17% of the company's revenue but saw an 8% decline in sales over the past year. The company faces increasing competition from Huawei, which has already integrated its own AI features into its latest smartphones.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/26/apple-intelligence-complext-approval-china/">Apple Intelligence Faces Complex Approval Process in China</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-faces-complex-approval-process-in-china.2444025/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The newest version of the ChatGPT app from OpenAI adds a new "Open SearchGPT" option to the Shortcuts app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. For those that have access to SearchGPT, tapping on the shortcut launches the ChatGPT app and invokes the web search feature.<br/>

OpenAI added ChatGPT Search to ChatGPT in late October, introducing improved AI-based internet searches. SearchGPT is meant to search the web "in a much better way than before," offering up links to relevant web sources along with more contextual information and support for follow-up questions.<br/>
<br/>
SearchGPT is available to those who have ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Teams, with OpenAI planning to roll out support to free users in the coming months. <br/>
<br/>
To access the SearchGPT action in Shortcuts, you'll need the latest version of the ChatGPT app, which was released yesterday.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/openai-searchgpt-shortcuts-app/">OpenAI Adds SearchGPT Option to Apple&#039;s Shortcuts App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-adds-searchgpt-option-to-apples-shortcuts-app.2444001/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube this week reintroduced support for the iOS Share Sheet, which means that it's now possible to share videos from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app and other video apps directly to YouTube.<br/>

Using the YouTube Share Sheet integration automatically imports a video to YouTube, where it can be edited and then uploaded to YouTube Shorts. Sharing a video to YouTube via the Share Sheet was an option in a prior version of the YouTube app, but it was removed back in 2018. Until this week, there was no option to use native sharing to upload to YouTube. <br/>
<br/>
YouTube updated its app to version 19.47.7 yesterday, but did not mention the new Share Sheet integration.

		<description><![CDATA[Instagram <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-instagram-dm-features-update">today announced</a> several updates for direct messages on its platform, including location sharing, nicknames, new sticker packs, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/instagram-location-sharing.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979565" /><br/>
There's now an option to share a live location with a friend for up to one hour on Instagram, which can be used for locating friends when getting together in real life. There's also an option to pin a spot to a map for coordinating meetups.<br/>
<br/>
Instagram says that locations can only be shared privately in DMs, either in a chat with just one other person or a group chat. All live locations will expire after an hour, and the feature is turned off by default. Only people in the chat can see your location, and location information cannot be forwarded to other chats. Instagram's blog post says that users should be "mindful" of their privacy and only share their location with real-life friends.<br/>
<br/>
DMs in Instagram can be customized with nicknames, which appear in DM chats. Users can set nicknames for themselves or their friends, simplifying lengthy usernames to make them easier to recognize. Creating a nickname can be done by tapping on the chat name at the top of a conversation and then tapping on Nicknames and the username of the person.<br/>
<br/>
Along with location sharing and nicknames, Instagram has also added 17 sticker packs with 300 new stickers that can be used in DMs. There is a new option to favorite a sticker, and a new DM sticker tray.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/instagram-dm-live-location-sharing/">Instagram Adds Live Location Sharing to Direct Messages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-adds-live-location-sharing-to-direct-messages.2443984/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this month filed next-generation CarPlay images <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/designs/015079704-0001">with the EU's Intellectual Property Office</a>, as it seeks to protect the design of the upcoming software system there. It is yet another sign that next-generation CarPlay might finally be nearing launch, after a few <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/ios-18-2-beta-next-generation-carplay-icons/">redesigned icons for the system showed up in iOS 18.2 beta code</a> earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927534" /><em>Porsche's preview of next-generation CarPlay from December 2023</em></div><br/>
The images show various next-generation CarPlay instrument cluster and interface designs, including a few with what appears to be the logo for German automaker Audi. When it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">first previewed next-generation CarPlay</a> in June 2022, Apple said Audi was committed to offering it, but the automaker has yet to confirm any specific plans.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Next-Generation-CarPlay-EU-Image-Filings.jpg" alt="" width="7766" height="3749" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979556" /><em>A few of the next-generation CarPlay images filed in the EU</em></div><br/>
The database entries were discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already shown off what next-generation CarPlay looks like several times, so the images do not show anything we have not seen before, but the timing of the filings is notable. <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple's website</a> continues to say that the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay support will "arrive in 2024," but it has yet to provide a more specific timeframe. Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed next-generation CarPlay vehicle designs</a> in December 2023, but neither automaker has released any vehicles with support yet.<br/>
<br/>
With just over a month left in the year, some are beginning to wonder if Apple will still meet its stated 2024 timeframe for next-generation CarPlay. So, it is reassuring that Apple is still working towards a launch behind the scenes.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/next-generation-carplay-images-in-eu/">Next-Generation CarPlay Images With Audi Logo Appear in EU Database</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-generation-carplay-images-with-audi-logo-appear-in-eu-database.2443980/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Specifically, you can get this sale in the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHZJVYY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1">Starlight Aluminum Case with Lake Green Sport Loop</a> and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ73CFS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1">Starlight Aluminum Case with Starlight Sport Band</a>. All of the other colors are sitting at the usual &#36;169.00 discount price on Amazon, which is still a solid second-best price.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Black Friday deals keep rolling in, and today we're tracking a new record low price on the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) on Amazon. You can get these headphones for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;153.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/airpods-pro-bulbs.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923440" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Before Black Friday 2024, these were typically priced around &#36;189.99 on sale, so today's price is a massive discount on the AirPods Pro 2. The AirPods Pro 2 were updated in 2023 with USB-C, and also feature Active Noise Cancellation, Apple's H2 chip, and Spatial Audio.<br/>
