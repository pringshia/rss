		<description><![CDATA[AT&T has <a href="https://www.att.com/makeitright/">announced</a> that it will be providing impacted customers with a &#36;5 bill credit per account as compensation for the network's major outage across the U.S. on Thursday. The credits will automatically be applied within two bill cycles, it said.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ATT-Banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937556" /><br/>
AT&T said the bill credit offer does not apply to AT&T Business, prepaid, or Cricket customers. A spokesperson for the carrier <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/at-t-will-give-5-account-credits-after-thursdays-network-outage/">told <em>CNET</em></a> that those customers will "have options available to them if they were potentially impacted by the outage."<br/>
<br/>
The carrier's full statement apologizing for the outage:<blockquote>We apologize for Thursday's network outage. We recognize the frustration this outage has caused and know we let many of our customers down. We understand this may have impacted their ability to connect with family, friends, and others. Small business owners may have been impacted, potentially disrupting an essential way they connect with customers.<br/>
<br/>
To help make it right, we're reaching out to potentially impacted customers and we're automatically applying a credit to their accounts. We want to reassure our customers of our commitment to reliably connect them – anytime and anywhere. We're crediting them for the average cost of a full day of service.<br/>
<br/>
We're also taking steps to prevent this from happening again in the future. Our priority is to continuously improve and be sure our customers stay connected.</blockquote>AT&T also <a href="https://about.att.com/ecms/dam/snrdocs/network-employee-letter.pdf">shared the letter</a> that its CEO John Stankey sent to the company's employees. In it, he said the company "let down" many of its customers and has "already implemented changes to prevent what happened on Thursday."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>'Incorrect Process'</h2><br/>
Based on its initial review, AT&T <a href="https://about.att.com/pages/network-update">said</a> it believed that the outage was caused by the "application and execution of an incorrect process used as we were expanding our network," not a cyber attack. The U.S. government on Thursday said the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security were looking into the outage.<br/>
<br/>
The outage began in the early hours of Thursday morning, with tens of thousands of customers complaining that they were unable to make cellular phone calls, send or receive text messages, or use cellular data. AT&T said about three-quarters of its customers were able to access its network by around 6 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, and it said that it had fully restored its network by around 1 p.m. Eastern Time that day.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/att-crediting-customers-for-network-outage/">AT&amp;T Giving &#36;5 Credit to Customers Following Major Network Outage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/at-t-giving-5-credit-to-customers-following-major-network-outage.2420387/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 will likely include some design changes, but a macOS revamp might be a year or two away, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said Apple is working to update the design of iOS as "early as this year." A sketchy rumor claimed that iOS 18 would feature some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">visionOS-inspired design elements</a>, and while Gurman agreed that iOS could take some design cues from visionOS, he does not expect a "total overhaul that mirrors visionOS."<br/>
<br/>
While he hedged with "as early as this year" wording today in regards to iOS design changes, Gurman was more firm about iOS 18 being redesigned in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-12/apple-aapl-plans-ambitious-ios-18-and-macos-15-updates-seeks-to-squash-bugs-lovjlsf6">November edition</a> of his newsletter, when he said Apple's senior management had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">described iOS 18 as "ambitious and compelling,"</a> with "major new features and designs."<br/>
<br/>
As for macOS, Gurman said Apple has started early work on design changes for that operating system that could debut in 2025 or 2026. The platform last received a major redesign with macOS Big Sur in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce iOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC in June.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">iOS 18 Rumored to Have Design Changes, macOS Revamp Coming Later</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumored-to-have-design-changes-macos-revamp-coming-later.2420382/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has considered developing several new wearable devices over the years, including a smart ring for health and fitness, smart glasses, and upgraded AirPods with built-in cameras and more sensors, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

Below, we recap what Gurman shared about these devices in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smart Ring</h2><br/>
A few years ago, Apple's industrial design team presented the idea of a "smart ring" focused on health and fitness features to executives on the company's health team, according to Gurman. However, he said Apple is not actively developing the finger-worn device at this time, so it is unclear if it will ever be released.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said the ring could be a lower-cost alternative to the Apple Watch that could sync health and fitness data with a paired iPhone. It would compete with products like the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-ring-allegedly-in-development/">Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Ring</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smart Glasses</h2><br/>
It has long been rumored that Apple eventually hopes to release advanced AR glasses based on its Vision Pro headset. In the meantime, Gurman said the company has considered developing a "less ambitious" pair of smart glasses that would compete with the likes of Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and Amazon's Echo Frames.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has discussed creating glasses that would serve as an "AirPods replacement," with built-in speakers, cameras, health sensors, and AI capabilities, according to Gurman. The glasses are in a "technology investigation" stage within Apple's hardware engineering division, he said, so it sounds like a release is still far off. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods With Cameras</h2><br/>
Apple engineers last year started exploring how to fit low-resolution camera sensors into AirPods, according to Gurman. If ever released, he believes these AirPods could offer AI features that "assist people in their daily routines."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/apple-has-explored-smart-ring-and-glasses/">Apple Has &#039;Explored&#039; a Smart Ring, Glasses, and AirPods With Cameras</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-has-explored-a-smart-ring-glasses-and-airpods-with-cameras.2420380/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is still working on a new HomePod speaker with an "iPad-like display" built into it, but the device is unlikely to launch until 2025 at the earliest should the plans move forward, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said Apple has started "early work" on a HomePod with a screen with overseas suppliers, but he said the company has yet to make "enough headway" on the device for him to consider a launch to be imminent.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman reiterated that Apple has also explored a device that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/18/apple-work-on-apple-tv-homepod-continues/">combines an Apple TV, HomePod, and FaceTime camera</a>, along with iPad-like smart displays that could be magnetically attached to a wall, but it is unclear if these products will ever be released. He said Apple has been "indecisive" about its smart home product ideas for years.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reversed course and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-announces-new-homepod/">released a new full-sized HomePod in 2023</a> after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/">discontinuing the device in 2021</a>. Apple also continues to sell the HomePod mini, which has not received any major hardware updates since launching in 2020.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/">HomePod With &#039;iPad-Like Display&#039; Rumored to Launch in 2025 at Earliest</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-with-ipad-like-display-rumored-to-launch-in-2025-at-earliest.2420375/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon this weekend has a pair of accessory deals on popular Apple products: the Apple Pencil 2 and AirTag 4 Pack. You can get the Apple Pencil 2 for the all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00, and the AirTag 4 Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932QJ2JZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;78.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/apple-pencil-2-red.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887463" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
In regards to the Apple Pencil 2, this is only the second time we've tracked this price in 2024, and it beats the low price we tracked during the holidays by about &#36;10. The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the following iPads: iPad mini (6th generation), iPad Air (4th generation and later), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd generation and later), and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st generation and later). <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Pencil 2 for &#36;79.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you have the newest iPad Pro models, the second-generation Apple Pencil can now be detected while hovering up to 12mm above the display. This allows users to see a preview of their drawing before they make it, and with Scribble text fields automatically expand when the pencil gets near the screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/airtag-new-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847828" /><br/>
Secondly, the AirTag 4 Pack is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932QJ2JZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;78.00</strong></a> today on Amazon, down from &#36;99.00. This is just about &#36;4 off from the previous all-time low price on the accessory, and right now it's only available on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
If you just want one AirTag, Amazon also has the AirTag 1 Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0933BVK6T%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;24.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;29.00. This is another second-best price, and both models have an estimated delivery date around February 28.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932QJ2JZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;21 OFF</div>AirTag 4 Pack for &#36;78.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, so today would have marked his 69th birthday had he not <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/05/steve-jobs-has-passed-away/">passed away in 2011</a> at the age of 56.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/steve-jobs-holding-iphone-4.jpg" alt="" width="1599" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-745029" /><br/>
Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in 1976 to produce the very first Apple computers, revolutionizing the personal computer and building up to one of the most famous commercial launches in history, the Macintosh, in 1984. He was ousted from the company just a year later, but returned in 1997 as a floundering Apple purchased Jobs' follow-up company NeXT to serve as the future basis of the Mac operating system. <br/>
<br/>
Apple was reinvigorated with Jobs back at the helm and Jony Ive leading a team generating iconic design after iconic design. The duo oversaw not only a rebirth of the Mac but the creation of a number of other revolutionary products and services, most notably including the iPod and of course the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Under Jobs' leadership from 1997 until his 2011 death from cancer, Apple went from a company on the brink of failure to one of the biggest tech companies in the world.<br/>
<br/>
As he always does, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> paid tribute to Jobs on Twitter today.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> is set to succeed 2023's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, introducing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">over 25 new features</a> and improvements to Apple's high-end smartphones. With many users adopting two-year upgrade cycles, plenty of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro owners will be looking to upgrade to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; later this year, so this guide breaks down every major difference you should be aware of between the two generations based on rumors. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-14-Pro-vs-16-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937778" /></div><br/>
In 2022, Apple unveiled the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro as the successor to the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro, introducing an always-on display, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a 48-megapixel camera, the A16 Bionic chip, longer battery life, and more. Two years later, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to offer over 50 upgrades. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their 2022 predecessor are listed below, using information from reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
The design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to be a relatively significant evolution over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro, iterating on the titanium frame and slightly rounded edges introduced on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models last year. <br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h3><br/>
To accommodate larger displays, both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are rumored to grow in height and width. In addition to last year's increase in depth, the devices are due to be considerably larger, but with a notable reduction in weight thanks to the adoption of a titanium frame. <br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>

</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="displays">Displays</h2><br/>
Both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature larger displays than their predecessors, pushing the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max to be the biggest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> ever offered. There are also reportedly improvements to the underlying OLED technology in store, in addition to last year's slimmer bezels, making for a noticeable overall display upgrade.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are rumored to bring notable improvements in processing power, including a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> Apple silicon chip and 33% more memory.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[This week saw the surprise release of a new Apple Sports app for tracking sports scores across a number of leagues, while we learned more about features coming soon in iOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/top-stories-24feb2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937909" /><br/>
We also saw more rumors about AirPods updates coming later this year, and Apple's latest MacBook Pro models have hit Apple's refurbished products store at a nice discount, so read on for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>'Apple Sports' App Announced With Personalized Scoreboards and More</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-announced/">released a new Apple Sports app for the iPhone</a> that shows scores, stats, standings, upcoming games, betting odds, and more for a variety of leagues, such as the MLB, MLS, NBA, NHL, Premier League, and the NFL when its next season begins. For ongoing games, the app also displays real-time play-by-play information.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Sports-App-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1961" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937385" /><br/>
We <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-hands-on/">went hands-on with the app</a>, which has a very basic interface with scoreboards you can personalize by following your favorite teams and leagues. In an interview, Apple's services chief and noted sports enthusiast <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-simplicity/">Eddy Cue said the app's simple design is intentional</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Sports is available for free on the App Store in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, and is compatible with iOS 17.2 and later.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces 'Groundbreaking' New Security Protocol for iMessage</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-announces-imessage-security-upgrade/">announced a new post-quantum cryptographic protocol for iMessage</a> called PQ3. Apple says this "groundbreaking" and "state-of-the-art" protocol provides "extensive defenses against even highly sophisticated quantum attacks."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
PQ3 will be gradually rolling out for supported iMessage conversations starting with iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, and watchOS 10.4. Apple believes this new protocol's protections "surpass those in all other widely deployed messaging apps."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.4 Lets You See Your iPhone 15 Battery Health at a Glance</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-beta-4-to-developers/">fourth beta of iOS 17.4</a> seeded to developers and public beta testers this week includes some changes to the battery menu in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ios-17-4-battery-health-optimization-iphone-15.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937223" /><br/>
The menu now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/ios-17-4-iphone-15-battery/">shows you whether your iPhone's battery health is "normal"</a> at a glance, and shows the battery's cycle count. This information was already accessible elsewhere in iOS, but now it is in one convenient place starting with iOS 17.4, which will be released in March.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-raises-iphone-15-advertised-battery-lifespan/">increased the advertised battery lifespans of all iPhone 15 models</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>10 Hidden Messages Features in iOS 17</h2><br/>
iOS 17 was released around five months ago, but there are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/10-hidden-messages-features-in-ios-17/">some hidden features and functions in the Messages app</a> that you still might not be familiar with.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-Messages-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903379" /><br/>
We recently shared a list of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/10-hidden-messages-features-in-ios-17/">10 hidden Messages app features on iOS 17</a>. For example, did you know that you can hold the plus sign next to the typing field to quickly access your iPhone's photo library?<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Now Selling Refurbished M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro Models</h2><br/>
Apple this week began selling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/refurbished-m3-pro-m3-max-macbook-pro/">certified refurbished models of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips</a> for the first time since the laptops launched in November.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/m3-macbook-pro-14-16.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937044" /><br/>
As usual for Apple's refurbished products, prices are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent brand new models. In our view, Apple's refurbished products are virtually indistinguishable from its brand new products, providing a good opportunity for savings.<br/>
<br/>
Check out our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">Apple Deals roundup</a> for more discounts on Macs and other devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods 4 and AirPods Max With USB-C Still Expected Later This Year</h2><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/new-airpods-later-this-year-rumor/">release fourth-generation AirPods and updated AirPods Max later this year</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Airpods-Max-Feature-Red-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936395" /><br/>
Gurman said there will be two types of fourth-generation AirPods, with the higher-end ones to feature active noise cancellation and a speaker built into the USB-C charging case for Find My sounds.<br/>
<br/>
As for the AirPods Max, the only notable change expected is a USB-C charging port.<br/>

		<title>Apple Explored These Notch and Dynamic Island Designs for iPhones</title>

		<category>Dynamic Island</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[With the iPhone 14 Pro models in 2022, Apple introduced the Dynamic Island, which can morph and expand to display system alerts, sports scores, and a variety of other information. The feature makes the space surrounding the front camera and Face ID sensors useful compared to the notch on older iPhone models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-Notch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938010" /><br/>
Apple explored a variety of ideas for the iPhone's notch area over the years before arriving at the current Dynamic Island design, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. We recreated the images below based on our source material to provide a never-before-seen look at some of the concepts that Apple considered.<br/>
<br/>
Before the Dynamic Island, Apple explored a popover menu on the right side of the screen that would have provided users with quick access to the time, cellular signal and Wi-Fi strength, display brightness, volume, and battery charge level. The menu essentially looks like a second notch, and it would disappear when not in use.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea that Apple considered was hiding the notch with an all-black status bar area at the top of the screen. OLED displays show the color black by turning off individual pixels, so this design would have contributed to battery life savings.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Alternate-Notch-Design-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3750" height="2109" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937933" /><br/>
Apple later came up with the idea of the Dynamic Island, and it explored a variety of different designs for this, as pictured below. <br/>
<br/>
Apple initially made the Dynamic Island permanently elongated across the top of the screen, before deciding that it would be less intrusive if it changed size as necessary. Apple also considered showing volume and a full row of system shortcuts in the Dynamic Island, tested a never-used layout for ongoing phone calls, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Alternate-Dynamic-Island-Design-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937932" /><br/>
Apple has since expanded the Dynamic Island to all iPhone 15 models, while it continues to sell the iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus with a notch. Rumors suggest that Apple eventually plans to move the iPhone's front camera and Face ID sensors under the display, but this transition is not expected to begin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">until next year at the earliest</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/iphone-notch-and-dynamic-island-designs/">Apple Explored These Notch and Dynamic Island Designs for iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explored-these-notch-and-dynamic-island-designs-for-iphones.2420258/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip to its certified refurbished store <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">in Canada</a> and select European countries, including <a href="https://www.apple.com/at/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/be-nl/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Belgium</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">France</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/de/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/it/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">the Netherlands</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/es/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ch-de/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">the UK</a>, for the first time since the laptop debuted in October. Availability in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro/">began earlier this month</a>.<br/>

As usual for Apple's refurbished products, the refurbished 14-inch MacBook Pro models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent brand new models. A variety of configurations and color options are available.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says it puts refurbished Macs through a "thorough cleaning process and inspection" to ensure they are fully functional and in good condition, and they are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage. The laptops are repackaged in a plain white box with all accessories and manuals.<br/>
<br/>
In our view, Apple's refurbished Macs are virtually indistinguishable from brand new ones, providing a good opportunity for savings directly from Apple. However, larger discounts are often <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">available from resellers like Amazon</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/refurbished-m3-macbook-pro-canada-europe/">Apple Begins Selling Refurbished 14-Inch MacBook Pro With M3 Chip in Canada and Europe</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-refurbished-14-inch-macbook-pro-with-m3-chip-in-canada-and-europe.2420249/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has been beta testing iOS 17.4 for nearly a month now. Below, we explain when the update is likely to be released to all users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In its press release announcing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major App Store changes in the EU</a>, which were implemented in response to new regulations under the EU's Digital Markets Act, Apple confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released at some point in March:<blockquote>Developers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</blockquote>Apple has until March 6 to comply with the Digital Markets Act, in order to avoid fines, so iOS 17.4 will likely be released on or before that date.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the changes in the EU, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">key new features in iOS 17.4</a> include Apple Podcasts transcripts, a new iMessage security protocol, new emoji, and the ability to use the Apple Cash card on more websites by generating a virtual card number. The update also includes preparations for the launch of next-generation CarPlay later this year.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 is compatible with the iPhone XS and newer. The update will be available in the Settings app under General → Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
Other software updates expected to be released in March include iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, watchOS 10.4, tvOS 17.4, and visionOS 1.1. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/ios-17-4-release-date/">When Will Apple Release iOS 17.4 for iPhones?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-will-apple-release-ios-17-4-for-iphones.2420243/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple often holds its first media event of the year in March, so the company could be just weeks away from announcing new products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/New-Macs-iPads-iOS-17-4.jpg" alt="" width="3198" height="1798" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936049" /><br/>
Below, we have outlined what to expect from a potential Apple Event this March. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Past Apple Events in March</h2><br/>
Apple has held five events in March since 2015:<ul><li>Monday, March 9, 2015</li><br/>
<li>Monday, March 21, 2016</li><br/>
<li>Tuesday, March 27, 2018</li><br/>
<li>Monday, March 25, 2019</li><br/>
<li>Tuesday, March 8, 2022</li></ul><h2>iOS 17.4 in March</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">press release</a> announcing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major App Store changes in the EU</a>, in response to the Digital Markets Act, Apple confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released in March:<blockquote>Developers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</blockquote>Apple has until March 6 to comply with the Digital Markets Act in order to avoid fines, so iOS 17.4 will likely be released before then.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the changes in the EU, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">key new features in iOS 17.4</a> include Apple Podcasts transcripts, a new iMessage security protocol, new emoji, and the ability to use the Apple Cash card on more websites by generating a virtual card number. The update also includes preparations for the launch of next-generation CarPlay later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Other software updates expected to be released in March include iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, watchOS 10.4, tvOS 17.4, and visionOS 1.1. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Rumored Announcements</h2><br/>
<h3>New iPads With Aluminum Magic Keyboard</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Apple will likely launch new iPad Pro and iPad Air models "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">around the end of March</a>," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPad Pro models are widely expected to be the first iPads equipped with brighter and more vivid OLED displays. Other rumored or likely features for the iPad Pro include the M3 chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">MagSafe wireless charging</a>, a redesigned Magic Keyboard with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">larger trackpad and an aluminum top casing</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">larger 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> is expected alongside an updated 10.9-inch model. Other rumored or likely features for the iPad Air include the M2 chip, a redesigned rear camera bump, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
Could the second-generation Apple Pencil recently going on sale for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/17/amazon-apple-pencil-2-low-price/">record-low price</a> hint at a third-generation Apple Pencil announcement too?<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New MacBook Airs</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898576" /><br/>
Gurman also expects Apple to announce new MacBook Airs in late March.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air are expected to be updated with the M3 chip simultaneously, with key benefits over the M2 chip including faster performance and hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes are expected for the MacBook Air this year, but the laptops will likely gain support for Wi-Fi 6E like other Macs.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already updated the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip in October 2023.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New iPhone Color?</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-14-Yellow-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887956" /><br/>
Apple often introduces new iPhone colors around March or April, midway through the smartphone's annual release cycle.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>March 2023:</strong> Apple made the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/07/apple-announces-yellow-iphone-14/">available in Yellow</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>March 2022:</strong> Apple introduced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-unveils-new-iphone-13-green-and-iphone-13-pro-alpine-green-colors/">new Green color for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini</a>, and a new Alpine Green color for the iPhone 13 Pro models.</li><br/>
<li><strong>April 2021:</strong> Apple made the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-launching-iphone-12-in-new-purple-color-on-april-30/">iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini available in Purple</a>.</li></ul>Will the new color this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-15-productred-possibility/">be (PRODUCT)RED</a>?<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/what-to-expect-at-apple-event-march-2024/">What to Expect at Potential Apple Event in March: iPads, Macs, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-at-potential-apple-event-in-march-ipads-macs-and-more.2420234/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Belkin recently came out with the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro for capturing video, and while there are several other similar products with video tracking on the market, we thought we'd test Belkin's because it brings something new - support for DockKit.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wj5o8tHCXZM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
DockKit is a feature that provides automated subject tracking technology through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> itself, which means the Stand Pro is the most advanced of the movement tracking stands on the market. Note that the Stand Pro is only for capturing video - it doesn't work with still photos.<br/>
<br/>
The Stand Pro can follow you on camera as you move around a room, offering 360 degrees of panning and 90 degrees of tilting for video calls and recording content. It is compatible with both the front and rear cameras of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and can be used in either vertical or landscape orientation.<br/>
<br/>
The Stand Pro requires an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 or later with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, because it uses a magnetic attachment to hold the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in place. Pairing to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is done through NFC, and then the Stand Pro can be used with any app that needs the camera. It works with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and more, and turning it on and off is as simple as pushing the single button on the device.<br/>
<br/>
With a built-in battery, the Stand Pro can work for up to five hours so it can be used anywhere. When it is plugged in, it can charge a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at up to 15W. Belkin includes a five foot USB-C cable and 30W power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
The Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is <a href="https://www.belkin.com/auto-tracking-stand-pro-with-dockkit/P-MMA008.html">available from Belkin</a> for &#36;180.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/">Belkin</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/belkin-stand-pro-hands-on/">Testing Belkin&#039;s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-belkins-auto-tracking-stand-pro-with-dockkit.2420228/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<strong>Update — 10:09 a.m. Pacific Time:</strong> Apple says the App Store showing an app verification screen in the EU is a bug and will be fixed before iOS 17.4 is released to all users. Original story follows.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-beta-4-to-developers/">latest iOS 17.4 beta</a>, Apple asks iPhone users in the EU to verify an app's information before installing it from the App Store. The prompt was spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1761031633774190980">Dimitris Sartzetakis of @iSWUpdates</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1avtztu/ios_17_db4_if_an_app_is_installed_via_spotlight/">others</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Shazam-Authentication-App-Store-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937777" /><br/>
iOS 17.4 will allow iPhone users in the EU to install apps from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">so-called "alternative app marketplaces,"</a> and the verification screen will appear in those storefronts too. Apple is likely aiming to avoid anticompetitive complaints by also showing the prompt in its own App Store, should it remain in the public release of iOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously announced that iOS 17.4 will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/04/ios-17-4-new-features-and-changes/">released in March</a>, and the App Store changes only apply in the <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/easy-read_en">27 countries</a> that are part of the EU, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and others. Notably, the UK left the EU in 2020.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/app-store-new-verify-install-screen/">iOS 17.4 Beta Adds New App Verification Screen to App Store in EU [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-beta-adds-new-app-verification-screen-to-app-store-in-eu-updated.2420227/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Handful of Apple Vision Pro Units Develop Identical Crack in Cover Glass</title>

		<description><![CDATA[A small number of Apple Vision Pro owners have claimed that their headsets developed a hairline crack down the middle of the front cover glass, despite having never been dropped or mishandled.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/cracked-glass-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937762" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Photo of hairline crack in Vision Pro front glass (credit: Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1axc3bo/sudden_random_crack_in_the_front_glass/">Inphenite</a>)</em></div><br/>
The first report was posted in the subreddit /r/VisionPro about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ajl51r/3_days_in_and_we_have_a_crack_on_the_outer_glass/">18 days ago</a>, and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1axj5sp/woke_up_today_with_a_crack_down_the_front_middle/kror2jt/">several more have appeared</a> in the last week. All of the images show a distinctly similar vertical hairline crack above the nose bridge, implying that the damage is occurring at a particular point of tension, where the curvature of the laminated glass is most pronounced.  <br/>
<br/>
We were unable to find additional similar reports on social media, on Apple's online Support Community, or in the <em>MacRumors</em> forums, suggesting that this is quite possibly a manufacturing defect limited to a small batch of units, rather than a widespread problem.<br/>
<br/>
The reports all mention that the crack became visible suddenly and for no apparent reason, after the headsets had been connected to the external battery pack and stored overnight (some in Apple's Travel Case) with the soft front cover attached. <br/>
<br/>
One theory is that the crack is due to pressure exerted on the glass when tightening the straps, which is causing "bowing" of the surrounding frame. Others speculate that the problem may be due to an overheating issue which is expanding the glass and leading it to crack at its weakest point. Given that the battery is external to the headset, any heat generated would presumably need to be caused by a background software process gone haywire.  <br/>
<br/>
Apple's documentation <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117740">states</a> that Apple Vision Pro continues to draw power from the battery pack when it is not in use, allowing the device to sync mail, photos, and other data. If the headset isn't worn for 24 hours, Vision Pro powers down automatically.<br/>
<br/>
With AppleCare, the deductible fee for a <a href="https://support.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/repair">cover glass repair</a> costs &#36;300. Without AppleCare coverage, the same repair costs &#36;800. Some of the owners affected say they have contacted Apple Support and have been asked to pay the repair costs, since the crack has not officially been identified as a manufacturing defect.<br/>
<br/>
Apple typically introduces special repair programs for products that have a recognized hardware issue, but Apple is unlikely to undertake an internal manufacturing probe unless reports of identical defects become more widespread. Anyone with the same issue is advised to contact <a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/topics">Apple Support</a> and escalate their case to increase the likelihood that Apple sees a potential problem requiring a formal investigation.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/apple-vision-pro-front-glass-cracked-reports/">Handful of Apple Vision Pro Units Develop Identical Crack in Cover Glass</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/handful-of-apple-vision-pro-units-develop-identical-crack-in-cover-glass.2420222/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is relying on different OLED display suppliers for the upcoming 11-inch and 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, with Samsung exclusively producing 11-inch panels and LG making the 13-inch panels. <br/>
<br/>

According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=26128">The Elec</a></em>, Samsung has cemented its position as the sole supplier of the initial quantity of OLED displays for the 11-inch model, or the first batch to be mass produced for the launch of the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
LG was originally scheduled to also begin producing the 11-inch OLED panel, but as things stand the two panel companies are currently producing only one type of OLED display each. Initial production at both suppliers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/oled-ipad-displays-enter-production/">started last month</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Industry insiders suggest the division of labor is due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies. Apple is rumored to be aiming for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/oled-ipad-lightweight-design-and-image-quality/">"unrivaled" image quality</a>, as well as a design that cuts down on the thickness and weight of the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>‌ display.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Korean-language report, the situation may change after production of the initial quantity, depending on fluctuations in production yield and possible adjustments to Apple's demand forecast for the new &zwnj;OLED &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro&zwnj; models. Apple's shipments forecast for the year have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-planning-to-sell-fewer-oled-ipad-pros/">reportedly</a> decreased to 8 million units, down from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year. <br/>
<br/>
OLED displays are a first for the ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌ lineup. Apple has been using OLED technology for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the Apple Watch, but larger OLED screens are more expensive. Compared to LED or mini-LED, OLED brings deeper blacks and more vivid colors. The OLED ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ models could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">much thinner</a> than the current LED versions thanks to the new display technology. The larger 12.9-inch ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌, for example, could be more than 1mm thinner.<br/>
<br/>
Along with new displays, the ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ models are expected to be powered by Apple's latest M3 chip, which debuted in new MacBook Pro models last year. The M3 is built on 3-nanometer technology, and should bring a notable graphics improvement over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip that is currently used in the ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌. <br/>

The new displays are expected to come to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">as soon as March 2024</a>.
