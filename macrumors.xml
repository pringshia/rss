		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing a fix for an issue causing some Apple Watches to experience excessive battery drain after being updated to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-watchos-10-1/">watchOS 10.1</a>, the company said today in an internal memo shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/watchOS-16x9.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-890854" /><br/>
In the memo, which <em>MacRumors</em> obtained from multiple sources, Apple said the issue will be fixed in a watchOS update that is "coming soon." Apple did not provide any additional details in the memo, so it is unclear what the underlying cause of the issue is, how many customers are affected, and if every Apple Watch model is impacted.<br/>
<br/>
There have been complaints about this issue from customers across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-watchos-10-1-with-double-tap-namedrop-and-more.2408650/post-32666614">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255241541">Apple Support Community</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/watchos/comments/17gpob9/101_battery_drain/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Martin_J_Cooper/status/1720728159681704166">X</a> since watchOS 10.1 was released in late October. The issue seems to affect a variety of Apple Watches, ranging from older models like the Apple Watch Series 5 to the latest Apple Watch Ultra 2.<br/>
<br/>
"WatchOS 10.1 is killing the battery on my Apple Watch," wrote customer Martin Cooper on X. "100% to 50% in less than 60 mins."<br/>
<br/>
Apple's developer release notes for iOS 17.1 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-17_1-release-notes#Power">said</a> that update fixed an issue where "increased power consumption might occur" when an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 is paired with an iPhone running iOS 17, but evidently the Apple Watch battery drain issue has not been completely fixed, so a watchOS update will be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> recently reported that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/ios-17-1-1-is-coming/">preparing to release iOS 17.1.1</a> for the iPhone, and it is likely that the Apple Watch battery drain issue will be fixed in a watchOS 10.1.1 update. However, it is possible that the fix might not arrive until watchOS 10.2, which is currently in beta testing and is expected to be released in December.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/04/watchos-update-to-fix-battery-drain-issue/">watchOS Update Coming Soon With Fix for Apple Watch Battery Drain</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-update-coming-soon-with-fix-for-apple-watch-battery-drain.2409877/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202344/DMA_100027_197.pdf">recently claimed</a> that Safari is three different browsers in effort to avoid regulation in the European Union (via <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/apple_safari_browser/"><em>The Register</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/safari-icon-blue-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833485" /><br/>
The claim came as part of a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202344/DMA_100027_197.pdf">response</a> to the European Union in August, just before the European Commission designated many of Apple's iOS, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, and Safari as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">gatekeeper platforms</a>. This classification means that Apple now has to ensure that these platforms fall in line with the Digital Markets Act's requirements, such as allowing browser engines other than WebKit and the installation of third-party app stores.<br/>
<br/>
It has now emerged that after being informed that Safari was likely to fall under the DMA's regulations, Apple filed formal a response to the European Union claiming that Safari is, in fact, "three distinct web browsers." The company's claim is based on the argument that Safari for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS are entirely different and serve different purposes.<br/>
<br/>
On example cited by Apple is Safari's sidebar feature on iPadOS and macOS, allowing users to see opened tabs, tab groups, bookmarks, and browsing history. Since this feature is unavailable in the version of Safari for iOS, Apple claimed that it is a distinctly different browser. The company added that each version of Safari serves different purposes for users depending on the device upon which it is accessed.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission went on to point out that Safari's functionality and underlying technologies are near-identical across platforms. The Commission even highlights Apple's own marketing materials for its Continuity feature, which appear to contradict the company's claims, touting the tag line "Same Safari. Different device." As a result, the Commission rejected Apple's claim and insists that "Safari qualifies as a single web browser, irrespective of the device through which that service is accessed."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is now obliged to ensure that Safari adheres to the DMA's requirements, such as by allowing non-WebKit-based browsers on iOS and iPadOS. Companies that do not adhere to the new regulations risk facing EU investigations, substantial fines, and the imposition of "behavioral or structural remedies." The fines can amount to 10 percent of a company's global turnover, with a 20 percent penalty for repeat violations. Questions remain about whether Apple's argument about Safari being three different browsers violates the DMA's Anti-Circumvention provision that forbids subdividing a platform's market share to avoid regulation. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/04/apple-argued-safari-is-three-different-browsers/">Apple Argued Safari Is Three Different Browsers to Avoid Regulation</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-argued-safari-is-three-different-browsers-to-avoid-regulation.2409850/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's "Scary Fast" event this week went off about as expected, with Apple showing off its next-generation Mac chips in a couple of product lines during a fast-paced 30-minute presentation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/top-stories-4nov2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920863" /><br/>
Our biggest stories this week unsurprisingly delved into Apple's announcements including some early tidbits on the updated MacBook Pro and iMac, a goodbye to the Touch Bar, and more, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything Apple Announced During the 'Scary Fast' Event</h2><br/>
Trick or treat! Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">held its "Scary Fast" event</a>, focused entirely on the Mac. During the brief presentation, Apple announced new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, and an updated iMac with the M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Everything-Announced-at-Scary-Fast-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919534" /><br/>
We've <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">recapped everything that Apple announced during the event</a> for those who missed it or want to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces New 14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Models With M3 Series Chips</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are equipped with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips</a>, and there is now an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro available with the standard M3 chip as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/">available in a Space Black finish</a> when configured with the M3 Pro or M3 Max chip, and they are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/new-macbook-pros-20-percent-brighter-displays/">equipped with 20% brighter displays</a> compared to the previous generation.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are available to order now, and most configurations will launch on Tuesday, November 7.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces New iMac With M3 Chip</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-imac-with-m3-chip/">updated the 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip</a> for up to 35% faster performance compared to the previous model with the M1 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919460" /><br/>
The all-in-one desktop computer features the same design and color options as the 2021 model. There are only a few other changes with the new iMac, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/imac-max-memory-wi-fi-6e/">Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 support</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to rumors, the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad accessories <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/magic-accessories-still-feature-lightning/">still have Lightning instead of USB-C</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Discontinues 13-Inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro following the event</a>, meaning that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/">Touch Bar has now been completely phased out</a> after seven years.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/13-inch-macbook-pro-2022-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1100" height="619" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850662" /><br/>
The first MacBook Pro models with the Touch Bar were released in October 2016, as part of a controversial redesign that also included a defective butterfly keyboard and the removal of many connectivity options, including an SD card slot, HDMI port, and MagSafe.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>First Benchmark Results Surface for M3 Chip in New Macs</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">first benchmark results for the standard M3 chip</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-max-chip-benchmark-results/">high-end M3 Max chip</a> surfaced in the Geekbench 6 database after Apple's event, providing a closer look at CPU performance improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
The results show the M3 chip is around 20% faster than the M2 chip, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-max-chip-benchmark-results/">M3 Max chip is around as fast as the M2 Ultra chip</a> that debuted in the Mac Pro and Mac Studio desktop computers earlier this year.<br/>

The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with a customizable Action button that replaces the traditional mute switch on previous iPhones. By default, the button is set to toggle between Ring and Silent modes, but it can also be assigned to a different action for quick access to the camera, flashlight, Voice Memos, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with iOS 17.2, the Action button can now be assigned to the Translate app for quick access to language translation in the Dynamic Island.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Widgets</h2><br/>

<br/>
Starting with iOS 17.2, favorited songs are also added to a new Favorite Songs playlist.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Music: Listening History Focus Filter</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-focus-filters.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918906" /><br/>

iMessage Contact Key Verification allow users who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials, to further verify that they are messaging only with the people they intend. In conversations between users who have enabled iMessage Contact Key Verification, users are alerted if a state-sponsored attacker or other malicious actor were ever to succeed breaching cloud servers and inserting their own device to eavesdrop on the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
As an additional layer of security, iMessage Contact Key Verification users are able to compare a Contact Verification Code in person, on FaceTime, or through another secure call to further verify they are communicating only with whom they intend.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previewed iMessage Contact Key Verification in December 2022, and it is finally launching as part of iOS 17.2.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iMessage: Sticker Reactions via Tapback Menu</h2><br/>

The USB-C model was just released a few weeks ago and this is a great price for the newest AirPods model. Because of this, as long as the two models are around the same price, we recommend going with the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C over Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Lastly, the high-end AirPods Max are available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;479.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;549.00. Discounts on the AirPods Max have been rare over the past few months, so this one is a second-best price on the over-ear headphones.<br/>
<br/>

We talk through our candid feelings about the unusual Apple event and the way in which the company presented its latest devices. We look at the all-new M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, and weigh up the new MacBook Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, who should consider upgrading to the next-generation machines, and more. Let us know what you think of Apple's new Macs in the comments.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've once again <a href="https://www.lululook.com/">teamed up with Lululook</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> and one of <a href="https://www.lululook.com/collections/apple-watch-bands">Lululook's Titanium Apple Watch Bands</a> to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903372" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/lululook-modern-band-2.jpg" alt="" width="2655" height="1493" /><br/>
Lululook has range of high-quality titanium and carbon fiber Apple Watch bands that match the 49mm Apple Watch Ultra models, with the bands specifically for Apple's newest wrist-worn device. Lululook's bands are ideal for Apple Watch Ultra owners who are looking for a band option that is refined enough for the office and other situations where sportier bands don't quite work.<br/>
<br/>
Lululook's <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C4H44HQK%2F">Link Titanium Band</a> is the closest match to Apple's own stainless steel Link Bracelet, but in a titanium color that works better with the Apple Watch Ultra. The band has a secure closing mechanism, and at &#36;70, it's more affordable than the Link Bracelet.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903369" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/lululook-timeless-band.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" /><br/>
Lululook also has a version of the Link Titanium Band that comes with a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CKMK7VLH%2F">simpler magnetic clasping mechanism</a>. It's a bit more expensive at &#36;90, but the dual magnetic buckle is simple to get on and take off, plus the locking mechanism makes sure it stays on the wrist.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Titanium-Compatible-Apple-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0C1GJLN9R">Modern Titanium Band</a> from Lululook is the company's most unique, and Lululook says that it was inspired by Iron Man. Available for &#36;37, this is the band that stands out the most of the bunch, so if you want a modern version of a titanium band it's worth checking out.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903368" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/lululook-modern-band.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="1700" /><br/>
Those looking for something unique might be interested in Lululook's &#36;80 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Apple-Carbon-Magnetic-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0BV29P1NY%2F">Carbon Fiber Apple Watch Band</a>, which is made of a lightweight carbon fiber material. Lululook says that it offers the light weight of plastic with the toughness of stainless steel for a comfortable fit. The watch has a magnetic band so it's easy to get on and off, and it can be customized to your size by removing links.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/carbon-fiber-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920793" /><br/>
All of the bands from Lululook are made from lightweight titanium or carbon fiber material that is comfortable on the wrist and able to hold up to heavy use. Lululook says that the bands are waterproof and sweatproof, and because of the low weight of the material, the bands work for all-day use.<br/>
<br/>
The bands are 200mm in length and are adjustable by removing links, so Apple Watch owners can get a perfect fit. Titanium is lighter than steel, so Lululook says that these bands are lighter than Apple's own Link band, and that the material will resist scratches and corrosion. Lululook's full range of Apple Watch bands can be <a href="https://www.lululook.com/collections/apple-watch-bands">found on the Lululook website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Lululook also manufactures a range of charging accessories designed for the Apple Watch. The &#36;70 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CGVFKM5M%2F">Lululook 3-in-1 Wireless Charger</a> works with the Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and AirPods, and can charge all three at once. The foldable design is convenient for travel, and it works with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> and accommodates StandBy mode. The Apple Watch and AirPods can charge at 5W, while the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can charge at 7.5W.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/lululook-charger-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920781" /><br/>
If you just need to charge the Apple Watch and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Lululook has a super small &#36;50 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Wireless-Ultra-Nano-Portable-Charging%2Fdp%2FB0CDWJTXPP%2F">Ultra Nano 2-in-1 Charger</a> that's perfect for travel. It has a magnetic charging puck for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and an upright charger for the Apple Watch, and it folds up when not in use. Lululook has a special deal on this charger right now, with a 40 percent discount available.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today indicated that its extended return policy is now in effect for the 2023 holiday shopping season. The policy applies to most products that Apple sells, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, accessories, and more.<br/>
<br/>

In the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, and many other countries, most products purchased between November 3 and December 25 of this year may be returned through January 8, 2024, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/help/returns_refund">according to Apple's website</a>. All purchases made after December 25 are subject to Apple's standard 14-day return policy.<br/>
<br/>
In some countries, the return window is slightly longer. In Italy, Spain, Turkey, Mexico, and Japan, Apple says most products purchased between November 3, 2023 and January 6, 2024 may be returned through January 20, 2024.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Early Black Friday deals <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/best-early-black-friday-apple-deals/">began in full force this week</a>, and we're recapping the best today. This includes all-time low prices on the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, Beats Studio Pro, HomePod, MagSafe Duo Charger, brand new M3 MacBook Pros, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The MacBook Pro is available in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes, with three distinct models starting at &#36;1,599, &#36;1,999, and &#36;2,499, so which should you choose?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/m2-macbook-pro-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-881970" /><br/>
With a range of three similar models in the lineup to choose from, our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these MacBook Pros is best for you. The three models are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>14-Inch MacBook Pro with M3</strong>: An entry-level model for users who need a machine that is more powerful and versatile than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>14-Inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro or M3 Max</strong>: A more powerful, high-end model with a choice of performance-focused chips. It comes with one extra Thunderbolt port, higher memory bandwidth, larger quantities of memory, support for additional external displays, an 8TB storage option, and a Space Black color option, but loses four hours of battery life and the Space Gray color option.</li><br/>
<li><strong>16-Inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro or M3 Max</strong>: A model with identical specifications to the 14-inch model with the M3 Pro or M3 Max chips, but with a significantly larger display and four extra hours of battery life. It also gains High Power Mode to boost performance, but loses the ability to fast charge via USB-C.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Each MacBook Pro is configurable to add more a more powerful processor and larger quantities of memory and storage. Read on for a detailed break down of all of the differences between the three MacBook Pro models.<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="display_size">Display Size</h3><br/>
The MacBook Pro is offered in 14.2-inch and 16.2-inch display sizes. The 16.2-inch display is a better replacement for a desktop machine and provides much more screen space to arrange multiple windows and use professional applications that benefit from the additional display area. The 14.2-inch display is still larger than the 13.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro models from recent years, and will likely be the best overall balance of needs for most users.<br/>
<br/>
While the "notch" containing the webcam does eat into the display space very slightly, both displays are larger than MacBook Pro models from before 2021, so there is still more display area overall. In addition, the display area below the notch has an aspect ratio of exactly 16:10, just like previous MacBook Pro models, to ensure that the notch does not impede normal display views or watching media. On this basis, if you are concerned about the notch, you should not necessarily feel obliged to get the larger, 16-inch MacBook Pro. That being said, since the notch is the same size on both models, it may be slightly less noticeable on the 16-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
The 16-inch model is, of course, physically larger than the 14-inch model, with a markedly bigger overall footprint. It is also worth noting that the 16-inch model is also 0.13 cm thicker and up to 1.4 pounds (0.64 kg) heavier. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/macbook-pro-sizes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1055" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821775" /><br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro is decidedly more portable and comfortable than the 16-inch model to carry around on a daily basis. Though the 16-inch MacBook Pro can still fit in larger bags and is an acceptable size for travel, it is a much bigger, heavier machine. If you are considering the 16-inch MacBook Pro, you should make sure you are comfortable with its size and weight – especially if you plan to use it on the go.<br/>
<br/>
Models with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips are available in a new Space Black finish, so if you want this color option, you must ensure that you are buying one of the more powerful machines.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="chip_configurations">Chip Configurations</h3><br/>
Both the 14-inch and 16-inch models are equally upgradeable to the M3 Max chip with a 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU, but if you are looking to spend as little as possible or do not need a high level of performance for intense workflows the 14-inch MacBook Pro is also available with the standard M3 chip. The M3 offers a more balanced processor with more of a focus on efficiency to prolong battery life, which will be more appropriate for users with less demanding requirements. Buyers should be aware that the M3 chip is limited to 100GB/s memory bandwidth, 24GB of memory, 2TB storage, and supports just one external display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Apple-M3-chip-series.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920046" /><br/>
We do not yet have a full set of <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks">Geekbench benchmarks</a> for the new MacBook Pro models, but the below table gives an early sense of the performance differences that we're aware of so far:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th></th><br/>
 <th>Single-Core</th><br/>
 <th>Multi-Core</th><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>M3</th><br/>
 <td>~3,140</td><br/>
 <td>~11,990</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>M3 Pro</th><br/>
 <td>TBC (~3,185 likely)</td><br/>
 <td>TBC (>14,300 likely)</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>M3 Max</th><br/>
 <td>~3,230</td><br/>
 <td>~21,560</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The base configuration of the 14-inch MacBook Pro features an M3 Pro with 11-core CPU and 14-core GPU, while the base 16-inch model contains an M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU. If you upgrade the 14-inch model to the same M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU that the 16-inch model starts with, it increases to &#36;2,299 – just &#36;200 less than the starting price of the 16-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are leaning toward buying the 16-inch MacBook Pro and want the M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU at a minimum, the slimmer price difference between the two models to just &#36;200 may make it easier to justify getting the larger machine. On the other hand, if you do not need the performance of the M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU, the 16-inch model may be overkill, and getting the 14-inch model will be the best way to keep costs down.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="high_power_mode">High Power Mode</h3><br/>
The 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Max chip offers a software feature called High Power Mode. When enabled, High Power Mode boosts the machine's performance to better meet the needs of intensive, sustained workloads.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/high-power-mode-macos.jpg" alt="" width="1578" height="1010" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-822840" /><br/>
High Power Mode is designed to optimize and improve performance for resource-intensive tasks, such as color grading 8K ProRes video, according to Apple. When enabled, High Power Mode will de-prioritize resource-hungry system processes in order to leverage the full performance capability of the ‌M3 Max chip. The setting is effectively the opposite of "Low Power Mode," which aims to decrease system performance in favor of prolonging battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/high-power-mode-macbook-pro/">How to Use High Power Mode on 16-inch MacBook Pro</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro does not feature High Power Mode, so if you want the ability to selectively push the M3 Max chip to its limits, you will need to buy the 16-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="battery_life">Battery Life</h3><br/>
Owing to its larger size, the 16-inch MacBook Pro contains a larger battery and has longer-lasting battery life. The 14-inch model contains a 70- or 72.4-watt-hour battery, while the 16-inch model contains a 100-watt-hour battery.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the M3 14-inch MacBook Pro can deliver up to 22 hours of battery life when playing back video, but this drops to 18-hours when configured with the M3 Pro or M3 Max. The 16-inch model adds four hours for 22-hour battery life when playing back video. For users who need maximum battery life, the M3 14-inch model or any of the 16-inch configurations will be the best option. That being said, the M3 Pro and M3 Max 14-inch model's 18-hour battery life is still good enough for most users.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="charging">Charging</h3><br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro uses a 70W or 96W USB-C power adapter for charging, while the 16-inch model comes with a 140W power adapter. Both models support fast charging, but a 96W or higher USB-C power adapter is required. The 96W USB-C power adapter is a &#36;20 option on the base model 14-inch MacBook Pro, but it comes as standard with M3 Pro configurations with a 12-core CPU and ones with the M3 Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-magsafe-3-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821241" /><br/>
Both models can use the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; 3 port to fast charge, but it is also possible to fast charge the 14-inch model using one of its USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports. If you require the flexibility of being able to fast charge via USB-C, you will need to buy the 14-inch model to have this functionality.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that both the 14- and the 16-inch models can charge with up to 100W via their USB-C ports, but since the 16-inch model has a larger battery, it is not classified as "fast charging" on this machine.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><br/>
The 16-inch MacBook Pro is &#36;500 more than the 14-inch model with the base M3 Pro chip, so you should be sure that you need the additional display area, battery life, and perhaps even High Power Mode support to justify its higher price. That being said, if you upgrade the 14-inch model to the same M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU that the 16-inch model starts with, the price difference shrinks to &#36;200, and it may be worth opting for the larger model – especially if you could take advantage of its longer battery life.<br/>
<br/>

Buyers of the 16-inch model should be aware that it is considerably larger, thicker, and heavier than the 14-inch model, to the extent that it could be needlessly cumbersome to some users. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is clearly a more portable machine, so if you intend to carry your MacBook Pro around frequently or need the versatility of it easily fitting into a bag for transport, the smaller model is the better option by far.<br/>
<br/>
If you need more than 8GB of memory and are interested in the 14-inch model with the M3 chip, a 16GB memory configuration pushes the price up to &#36;1,799. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro chip has 18GB of memory as standard and starts at &#36;1,999. In this case, it is likely worth spending the extra &#36;200 to gain one extra Thunderbolt port, three extra CPU cores, four extra GPU cores, two more gigabytes of memory, and Space Black color option, unless you are particularly concerned about losing two hours of battery life.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-vs-16-inch-macbook-pro/">Late 2023 MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 14-Inch and 16-Inch Models Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/late-2023-macbook-pro-buyers-guide-14-inch-and-16-inch-models-compared.2317972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While it was rumored that the iPhone 15 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/kuo-iphone-15-pro-models-solid-state-buttons/">would be equipped with solid-state buttons</a>, the devices ended up launching with traditional mechanical buttons. Attention has now shifted to whether the solid-state buttons will still happen with the iPhone 16 lineup next year, but there are conflicting rumors so far, as outlined below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913688" /><br/>
For context, solid-state buttons would provide haptic feedback when pressed to simulate the feeling of movement, similar to the Home button on the iPhone SE and the Force Touch trackpad on modern MacBooks. On the other hand, mechanical buttons actually move when pressed. All of the buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro models are mechanical, including the new Action button that provides quick access to an assigned function.<br/>
<br/>
Benefits of solid-state buttons could include fewer mechanical parts that can break and improved water resistance. Solid-state buttons could also potentially sit flush with the iPhone's frame, allowing for a more seamless design.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple analysts and a leaker claimed that Apple had tested solid-state buttons on prototype iPhone 15 Pro models, but the company apparently decided not to move forward with the change before mass production started <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-iphone-15-pro-no-solid-state-buttons-after-all/">due to "technical issues."</a><br/>
<br/>
Apple supplier Cirrus Logic seemingly confirmed that the solid-state buttons <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/05/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-buttons-cancellation/">had been canceled earlier this year</a>, and it has seemingly touched on the topic again. In a <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/307563939/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Q2-FY24-Shareholder-Letter_Final.pdf">shareholder letter this week</a>, the supplier shared the following information:<blockquote>Finally, during the quarter we completed the disposition of wafers associated with a new high-performance mixed-signal (HPMS) product that was previously expected to ship this year. As anticipated, the disposition did not have a material financial impact.</blockquote>In an email, an equity research analyst at British bank Barclays informed us that Cirrus Logic disposed of these wafers due to Apple canceling the solid-state buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro models. The devices were expected to have additional Taptic Engines that provided haptic feedback when the buttons were pressed, and Cirrus Logic was expected to supply Apple with haptic drivers that would have enabled this functionality.<br/>
<br/>
The analyst also told us that they do not expect iPhone 16 models to be equipped with solid-state buttons, given that Cirrus Logic has disposed of its related inventory for the project, but <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Marko Zivkovic believes otherwise. Last month, Zivkovic reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">entire iPhone 16 lineup will be equipped with solid-state Action and "Capture" buttons</a>. The purpose of the "Capture" button remains unknown, and he cautioned that Apple's plans could once again change as development progresses.<br/>
<br/>
Zivkovic said the "Capture" button would be located below the power button on the right side of the iPhone 16 models, should it materialize. As a result, he said the mmWave 5G antenna window on iPhone 16 models sold in the U.S. would be moved to the left side of the devices, below the volume buttons. This rumor was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/">seemingly corroborated</a> this week by a leaker on Chinese social media platform Weibo, but it is unclear if the account independently confirmed the information, or if it was simply repeating the details shared by Zivkovic.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, rumors about solid-state buttons for the iPhone 16 lineup do not align right now, with some sources expecting them and others not. As the launch of the devices next September draws closer, Apple's plans should become clearer.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/barclays/">Barclays</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/03/will-iphone-16-feature-taptic-buttons/">Will the iPhone 16 Feature Taptic Buttons?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-the-iphone-16-feature-taptic-buttons.2409756/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17.2, you can turn off your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Listening History with a new Focus filter, so if you allow someone else to use your device to listen to music, you can quickly activate the Focus with a tap and prevent their song choices from affecting your recommendations. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iOS-17-Apple-Music-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907547" /><br/>
Have you ever regretted letting a friend or family member use &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> after their poor song choices negatively influenced your personal music recommendations? <br/>
<br/>
If you have very young kids, the chances are that at some point you've played their favorite preschooler ditty to avoid a meltdown, only to later cringe when Apple's algorithms slip "Baby Shark" or some other infuriatingly repetitive song into your recently played/replay mixes. <br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, Apple has finally become aware of the regularity of such events, and in iOS 17.2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">currently in beta</a>, it has added a new Focus filter option that can help you automatically turn off your &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; listening history whenever you give up your device to those with, shall we say, more acquired listening tastes.<br/>
<br/>
The following steps show you how it's done. Note that you'll need to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-ios-17-beta-iphone/">download the iOS 17.2 beta</a> for this to work, otherwise you won't see the Listening History filter option. <br/>
<ol><li>Go to <strong>Settings ➝ Focus</strong> on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the top-right corner to create a new Focus, then tap <strong>Custom</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Give your new Focus an identifiable name, symbol, and color, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-music-listening-history-focus2.jpg" alt="focus" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920452" /><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Customize Focus</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down to "Focus Filters," ten tap <strong>Add Filter</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Choose the <strong>Music</strong> filter.</li><br/>
<li>Make sure the button is off next to <strong>Use Listening History</strong>, then tap <strong>Add</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-music-listening-history-focus1.jpg" alt="focus" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920453" /></ol>That's all there is to it. The next time music is going to be played for someone else on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, simply swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen to bring up Control Center and long press on the Focus button to select the Focus you created. Rest assured that whatever they play after that, won't play havoc with your &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; algorithms.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you don't feel like you benefit from &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s personal recommendations, and you don't have an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; profile where your listening history is shared, you can disable Listening History more permanently by going to <strong>Settings ➝ Music</strong> and toggling off the switch next to <strong>Use Listening History</strong>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-music-listening-history-focus-filter/">How to Stop Your Kids From Ruining Your Apple Music Recommendations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-stop-your-kids-from-ruining-your-apple-music-recommendations.2409735/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in October <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">announced</a> an M3-powered 24-inch iMac, as well as new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 series chips. So when will the rest of Apple's Mac lineup be updated to the latest M3 processors, and will they be worth the wait?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/When-Will-Apple-Launch-More-M3-Macs-Feature-Sans-13inch-MBP.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920524" /><br/>
Now that Apple's "Scary Fast" event has passed, attention naturally turns to the other Macs in the company's lineup and where they might fit into Apple's M3 roadmap. Here's what the latest rumors say.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M3 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Apple sells three versions of MacBook Air: A cheaper previous-generation 13-inch model with M1 chip, and 13-inch and 15-inch models equipped with the newer M2 chip. The question is, when will Apple discontinue the M1 MacBook Air and replace its top-of-the-line 13-inch and 15-inch machines with M3 equivalents?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-MacBook-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920517" /><br/>
<br/>
The existing 15-inch MacBook Air arrived earlier this year in June, which is not that long ago in terms of Mac update cycles. However, Apple released the M2 13-inch ‌MacBook Air back in June 2022. It is now the oldest Mac in Apple's current crop, having not been updated in over 480 days.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, Apple has 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air models in development, and both are said to be scheduled for release sometime in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect">first half of 2024</a>. Both models are said to have reached <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/four-new-macbooks-on-schedule-for-launch-in-2024/">engineering verification testing (EVT)</a>, an early production testing phase on prototype devices. The M3 chip used in the Airs is expected to have similar CPU and GPU core counts as the M2 chip in the current models.<br/>
<br/>
Given so much time has elapsed since the current 13-inch MacBook Air was launched, it might seem safe to assume this model will be the next beneficiary in line for Apple's M3 chip. However, Apple's roadmap for Apple silicon appears to be partly dictated by supplier production capacity, so we could see either one model launched first or both 13-inch and 15-inch models launched in tandem.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says the next-generation MacBook Airs are on schedule for launch between the spring and summer of next year at the earliest, which could also mirror the time frame of the current models' launches that took place at WWDC in June 2022 and 2023.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Mini</h2><br/>
Apple announced M2 and M2 Pro Mac mini models in January, just over 280 days ago, but Apple could be already testing an M3 Mac mini, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Mini-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920522" /><br/>
<br/>
In August, signs of an unknown "15,12" Mac machine were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/apple-testing-mac-mini-m3/">found in developer code</a>, with the Mac featuring an 8-core CPU (consisting of four efficiency cores and four performance cores), 10-core GPU, and 24GB RAM. Based on the similar specifications to the base M2 Mac mini (bar the existing model's 8GB RAM as standard), Gurman believes it represents a next-generation Mac mini.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">previously said</a> he was not expecting an M3 version of the Mac mini to launch until late 2024, but as it is already in testing, it could potentially be unveiled sooner.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Studio, Mac Pro</h2><br/>
Apple updated the ‌Mac Studio and Mac Pro with M2 series chips in June of this year. Mac Studio models come with either the M2 Max or M2 Ultra chip, while the Mac Pro has adopted the M2 Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Pro-and-Studio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920519" /><br/>
<br/>
Both Macs are considered to be in the middle of their product cycles, and there are as yet no reliable rumors about when more powerful M3 versions of either machines will be launched. But if Apple is committed to an annual upgrade cycle, we could see them in June 2024. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>13-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued</a> the 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro – and along with it the Touch Bar – replacing it with a 14-inch model that's equipped with a next-generation M3 chip. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/No-M3-MacBook-Pro-13-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920518" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro is up to 60 percent faster than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1. The M3 14-inch MacBook Pro also comes with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-macbook-pro-comparison/">number of other benefits</a> that make it worth the upgrade for anyone with the original 13-inch machine. So do not expect to see an M3-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro anytime soon, if ever.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M3 Performance Gains to Expect</h2><br/>
The M3 series of chips are built on TSMC's 3-nanometer process, bringing performance and efficiency improvements over Apple's previous M2 chips, which are based on the earlier-generation 5-nanometer process. <br/>
<br/>
The actual real-world gains depend on the M3 processor version, coupled with the particular Mac model and other component factors like RAM and thermal dissipation. Nevertheless, all of Apple's M3 chips also boast GPU improvements not found in the M2 series, including Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3</h3><br/>
Apple's base M3 chip will likely feature in future MacBook Air models, as well as an updated lower-end version of the Mac mini. At least in the MacBook Airs, the M3 chip is expected to have similar CPU and GPU core counts as the M2 chip in the current models, but that could be true for the Mac mini as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
Based on early benchmarks, the M3 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 3,000 and 11,700, respectively. The standard M2 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 2,600 and 9,700, respectively, so the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip, which is what Apple claimed during its "Scary Fast" event in October.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Pro</h3><br/>
It's not yet clear what performance gains to expect from the M3 Pro chip compared to the previous M2 Pro generation, but it is likely to be relatively minor. Bear in mind that when Apple announced the M3 series, the only slide that it didn't show is how much faster the M3 Pro is than the equivalent M2 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-pro-chip.jpg" alt="" width="5104" height="2868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919649" /><br/>
<br/>
The M3 Pro and M2 Pro chips in the 16-inch MacBook Pro have 12 CPU cores, but the M2 Pro actually features one additional GPU core over the M3 Pro. Despite that, Apple claims it is 10 percent faster than the M2 Pro GPU and 40 percent faster than the M1 Pro GPU. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Max</h3><br/>
Early benchmarks indicate that Apple's new M3 Max chip in the 16-inch MacBook Pro is around as fast as the M2 Ultra chip used in the current-generation Mac Pro and the higher-end Mac Studio. In other words, the M2 Ultra Mac Pro is being outperformed by what is on paper a lower-end machine, just four months after it was released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Max-Chip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920348" /><br/>
Note that the new 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S. when configured with the M3 Max chip, while the Mac Studio with the M2 Ultra chip starts at &#36;3,999, so you can effectively get the same performance for &#36;500 less by buying the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, which also includes a display, keyboard, and trackpad. <br/>
<br/>
Will this performance imbalance alone encourage Apple to bring forward the launch of M3-powered Mac Studio and Mac Pro models? Unlikely. But we can always hope. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Ultra</h3><br/>
Having not yet been announced, the M3 Ultra chip is something of an unknown quantity. However, given that the existing M2 Ultra encompasses two M2 Max chips for double overall CPU and GPU performance, as well as twice the memory bandwidth (800GB/s), expect similar performance gains over the M3 Max from Apple's next-generation high-end M3 Ultra chip.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/03/when-apple-launch-more-m3-macs/">These M3 Macs Are Still Coming, But Are They Worth the Wait?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-m3-macs-are-still-coming-but-are-they-worth-the-wait.2409726/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's embrace of titanium for its latest iPhone 15 Pro chassis appears to have impressed Samsung enough that the Korean rival plans to adopt the material for the next version of its flagship smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/1technizo-concept-ultra-s24.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920643" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Samsung S24 Ultra concept render by <a href="https://x.com/technizoconcept/status/1719577996061978810?s=46">Technizo Concept</a></em></div><br/>
The Galaxy S24 Ultra will be the first Samsung phone to use titanium and the company intends to expand the application depending on users' reception, according to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4672">The Elec</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
For the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, Apple is using a new titanium frame rather than a stainless steel frame, which cuts down on weight. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. <br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro weighs 187 grams, down from 206 grams for the iPhone 14 Pro, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max weighs 221 grams, down from 240 grams for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. <br/>
<br/>
According to the report, Samsung's adoption of titanium for the S24 Ultra is unlikely to lead to an equivalent weight reduction compared to the S23 Ultra, since Samsung currently uses light aluminum in its flagship devices, whereas Apple previously used heavier but more durable stainless steel.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>The Elec</em>'s sources, Samsung has been mulling using titanium cases for around two years, although the decision to go ahead with its commercializtion only came recently – but not without cost. Titanium is widely used in the aerospace sector. However, it is more difficult to handle in cutting and processing, and its low heat conductivity makes it harder to cut cleanly. <br/>
<br/>
Samsung is therefore bracing itself for lower yield rates, which will push up the price of the frames. The aluminum cases in the company's premium phones currently cost less than &#36;20, while titanium versions could cost up to &#36;100, according to the report. Samsung is said to have "tentatively" set a goal to make 15 million frame units – the same number of Galaxy S23 Ultra models it shipped this year.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/03/samsung-follows-iphone-15-pro-titanium-galaxy-s24/">Samsung to Follow iPhone 15 Pro and Use Titanium for Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-to-follow-iphone-15-pro-and-use-titanium-for-galaxy-s24-ultra.2409722/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held an earnings call for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 (third calendar quarter), with Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Apple CFO Luca Maestri sharing details on recent product sales, services growth, Apple's future plans, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834994" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1504" /><br/>
We've highlighted the most interesting takeaways from Apple's earnings call.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Services</h2><br/>
Apple's quarterly revenue was down one percent year over year at &#36;89.5 billion, but services revenue hit a new all-time revenue record. Services revenue was &#36;22.3 billion, up 16 percent from &#36;19.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Across all of 2023, Apple's services category brought in &#36;85 billion, up from &#36;78 billion in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, advertising, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>, payment services, and video hit all-time revenue records, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> saw an all-time revenue record for the September quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Sales</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> revenue was up during the quarter, coming in at &#36;43.8 billion, up from &#36;42.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue was down for the year, though, at &#36;200.6 billion, down from &#36;205.5 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue set a September quarter revenue record.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj;, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models sold better than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, but supplies of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and Pro Max were constrained, which impacted Apple's total &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple is "working hard" to make more &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max devices, and that the company expects to reach supply/demand balance at the end of the holiday quarter. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue is expected to grow year-over-year in the December quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Sales</h2><br/>
Mac sales <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/mac-revenue-down-m3-sales-improvements/">were way down</a> in Q4 2023, with Macs bringing in &#36;7.6 billion, down 34 percent &#36;11.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Mac revenue for all of 2023 was &#36;29.4 billion, down from &#36;40.2 billion in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, September Mac sales were up because of supply chain issues in June, a situation that Apple could not compete with this year. Cook expects Mac revenue to improve next quarter thanks to the October introduction of the M3 Macs, and he said that the negative 34 percent growth should not be seen as representative of the underlying performance of the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Sales</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales did not fare quite as badly as Mac sales, but &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue was also down. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; category brought in &#36;6.4 billion, down from &#36;7.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Apple has not released any new iPads this year, so the drop in &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue does not come as a surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Across 2023, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue came in at &#36;28.3 billion, down from &#36;29.3 billion in 2022. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that year over year performance for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will "decelerate significantly" because of changes in product launch timing. Apple last year launched a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> during the December quarter, and no new iPads are planned in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wearables, Home and Accessories</h2><br/>
Wearables revenue dropped as well, coming in at &#36;9.32 billion for the quarter, down from &#36;9.65 billion in the year-ago quarter. Wearable revenue for 2022 was at &#36;39.9 billion, down from &#36;41.2 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
Year over year revenue for the wearables category is expected to drop in the December quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Research and Development Spending</h2><br/>
Apple spent a total of &#36;30 billion on research and development in 2023, up from &#36;26.3 billion in 2022. Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that Apple's increased spending is due to Vision Pro, AI, machine learning, and silicon investments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Active Install Base</h2><br/>
Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that Apple's active installed base of devices has hit a new all-time high across all products and all of Apple's geographic segments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro</h2><br/>
Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; was asked whether he thinks the Vision Pro launch and consumer education process will ultimately be similar to the AirPods and Apple Watch, but he said no, because of the purchasing experience.<blockquote>"I would say no. There's never been a product like the Vision Pro, so we're purposely bringing it out in our stores only so we can really put a great deal of attention on the last mile of it. We'll be offering demos in the stores and it'll be a very different process than a normal grab-and-go kind of process."</blockquote>Cook went on to say that Apple is seeing a "tremendous amount of excitement around Vision Pro." Cook has tested some of the apps that developers are working on, and he claims that some "real blow away kind of things are coming out."<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro will be sold solely in the United States to begin with, and Cooks comments suggest that customers might be required to visit a retail store to make a purchase. Apple's Vision Pro website says that the headset will be available for purchase both online and in retail stores, but Apple could ask customers to come to a retail store to pick up an online purchase in order to ensure a proper fit.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-to-host-secretive-vision-pro-training-event/">recently said</a> that Apple will assemble Vision Pro headsets for customers in its stores, giving each user the appropriate headband, light seal, and prescription lenses if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Generative AI</h2><br/>
Cook was asked how Apple might be able to monetize generative AI, which he of course declined to comment on, but he said that Apple is "investing quite a bit" in AI and that there are going to be product advancements <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/tim-cook-generative-ai-comments/">that involve generative AI</a> in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple silicon</h2><br/>
An analyst asked Cook if it would ever be feasible for Apple to purchase "from the industry." Cook said that Apple silicon is "at the heart of the primary technologies" that Apple likes to control in its devices, and so he does not see the company "going back to buying off of the shelf."<br/>
<br/>
"I am happier today than I was yesterday than I was last week that we made the transition that we've made and I see the benefit every day of it," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's Search Deal With Google</h2><br/>
Cook was asked to comment on its web search partners, with a specific focus on the ongoing antitrust lawsuit that Google is facing from the U.S. Department of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple has "important relationships" with its web sear partners, but that he would not get into "commercial relationships" on the call. Cook said that he sees them "as important" and that Apple makes "decisions that we feel are in the best interests of our users."<br/>

<blockquote>If you zoom out and look at what we've done with AI and machine learning and how we've used it, these are fundamental technology integral to every product we ship.<br/>
<br/>
When we shipped iOS 17, it included features like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features. You can go all the way to the life-saving features on the watch and phone, like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI. We don't label them as such, because we labeled them as to what their consumer benefit is, but the fundamental tech behind it is AI and machine learning.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared its earnings results for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 (third calendar quarter), and Mac revenue saw a major drop compared to last year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919851" /><br/>
Mac sales came in at &#36;7.6 billion in Q4 2023, down 34 percent from &#36;11.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Mac revenue for all of 2023 was &#36;29.4 billion, down from &#36;40.2 billion in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CFO Luca Maestri attributed the drop to challenging market conditions and challenging compares to last year's Mac lineup. Because of supply chain issues during the June 2022 quarter, Mac sales spiked in the September 2022 quarter, which did not happen this year. Apple also updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> in June 2023 rather than September, which impacted September quarter sales compared to last year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did release new M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max Macs in late October, but sales of those devices will be reflected in the December quarter. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> told <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2023.html">CNBC</a></em> that he expects Mac performance to improve over the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
"I think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter," said Cook. "We've got the M3, we've got the new products, and we don't have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis," Cook said.<br/>
<br/>
Apple began allowing customers to purchase the new M3 Macs on Monday, with shipments to begin arriving next week. Apple appears to have plenty of supply of the new models, so there should be no supply constraints during the upcoming holidays.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/mac-revenue-down-m3-sales-improvements/">Mac Revenue Down 34% Year-Over-Year, But Tim Cook Expects &#039;Significant&#039; Improvement With M3 Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-revenue-down-34-year-over-year-but-tim-cook-expects-significant-improvement-with-m3-macs.2409676/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/">announced</a> financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, which corresponds to the third calendar quarter of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/aapl-4q23-line.jpg" alt="" width="1780" height="806" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920526" /><br/>
For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of &#36;89.5 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;23.0 billion, or &#36;1.46 per diluted share, compared to revenue of &#36;90.1 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;20.7 billion, or &#36;1.29 per diluted share, in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/27/apple-4q-2022-earnings/">year-ago quarter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gross margin for the quarter was 45.2 percent, compared to 42.3 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of &#36;0.24 per share, payable on November 16 to shareholders of record as of November 13.<br/>
<br/>
For the full fiscal year, Apple recorded &#36;383.3 billion in sales and &#36;97.0 billion in net income, down slightly from &#36;394.3 billion in sales and &#36;99.8 billion in net income for fiscal 2022.<blockquote>"Today Apple is pleased to report a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and an all-time revenue record in Services," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "We now have our strongest lineup of products ever heading into the holiday season, including the iPhone 15 lineup and our first carbon neutral Apple Watch models, a major milestone in our efforts to make all Apple products carbon neutral by 2030."</blockquote>As has been the case for over three years now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current quarter ending in December.<br/>

He added that Apple’s more expensive Pro and Pro Max iPhones were supply constrained because of high demand.<br/>
<br/>
<b>1:49 pm</b>: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-beats-quarterly-estimates-iphone-sales-edge-up-2023-11-02/">Cook to Reuters</a>: "In mainland China, we set a quarterly record for the September quarter for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>," Cook told Reuters.

<br/>
<b>2:05 pm</b>: "This was due to challenging market conditions, as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:06 pm</b>: Tim is citing the new M3 Macs introduced earlier this week as evidence of the company's innovation and investment in the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:06 pm</b>: "According to the latest data from StudentMonitor, nearly two out of three college students chose a Mac."<br/>

<br/>
<b>2:08 pm</b>: He continues by noting new features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> as more evidence of innovation.<br/>

The best products in the world should be the best products for the world. We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it. And because we know that climate change cannot be stopped unless everyone steps up and does their part."<br/>

<br/>
<b>2:13 pm</b>: CFO Luca Maestri is coming on the call to dive deeper into the financials.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:13 pm</b>: "Revenue for the September quarter was at &#36;9.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over two percentage points. And on a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:14 pm</b>: "We set a September quarter record in the Americas and saw strong performance across our emerging markets for both &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and services grew double digits."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:14 pm</b>: "Our total installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:14 pm</b>: "Our services revenue set an all-time record of &#36;22.3 billion, up 16% year over year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:15 pm</b>: "We reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific, and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:15 pm</b>: "Company gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially driven by leverage and favorable mix partially offset by foreign exchange."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:16 pm</b>: "Products gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:17 pm</b>: "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue was &#36;43.8 billion, up 3% year over year, and a new September quarter record. We had strong performance in several markets including an all-time record in India, and September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia. Our &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switchers."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:17 pm</b>: "Mac revenue was &#36;7.6 billion, down 34% year over year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business. Last year, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter, and were subsequently able to fulfill a significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:17 pm</b>: "Our install base is at an all-time high, and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. We saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the US."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:18 pm</b>: "&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; generated &#36;6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year over year. Similar to Mac these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago, and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base, with over half of the customers who purchase iPads during the quarter new to the product. The latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the US."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:19 pm</b>: "Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was &#36;9.3 billion, down 3% year over year. We had a September quarter record in Europe, and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach, with nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for the watch was recently measured at 97% in the US."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:19 pm</b>: "Services had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of &#36;22.3 billion, up 16% year over year. And we're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:20 pm</b>: "Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:20 pm</b>: "We continue to see increased customer engagement with our services, both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year over year, each reaching a new all-time high. Our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:21 pm</b>: Luca is citing a number of enterprise customers who are investing heavily into the Apple ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:21 pm</b>: "To our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over &#36;162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We increased commercial paper by &#36;2 billion, leaving us with total debt of &#36;111 billion As a result, net cash was &#36;51 billion at the end of the quarter."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:22 pm</b>: "During the quarter, we returned nearly &#36;25 billion to shareholders, including &#36;3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and &#36;15.5 billion to open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares, we also began a &#36;5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the repurchase and retirement of 22 million shares."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:23 pm</b>: "Our annual revenue was &#36;383 billion, down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment. Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance as we reported double digit EPS growth in the September quarter."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:23 pm</b>: "We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:23 pm</b>: "On foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:24 pm</b>: "As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. Revenue from the extra week last year added approximately seven percentage points to the quarter's total revenue."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:25 pm</b>: "We expect our December quarter total company revenue to be similar to last year. <br/>
<br/>
We expect &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. <br/>
<br/>
We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last-year supply disruptions and the one extra week, we expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. <br/>
<br/>
We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches on &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. We launched a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; next-generation during the December quarter a year ago. Last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2nd Gen, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> and the first Apple Watch Ultra."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:26 pm</b>: We're moving to the Q&A section.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:26 pm</b>: Q: On &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; storage and demand versus &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;. As demand for storage grows, are you seeing a mix shift towards higher storage &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, or are consumers mostly opting for the same because of increased uptake of &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+? What are some of the strategic and financial considerations here and trade-offs as you think about the mix shift towards higher storage models versus &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; penetration?<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:27 pm</b>: A: We started the line with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pro Max at 256GB, and so we are seeing a different mix, if you will, this year than last year. Outside of that, not significant, significant changes."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:29 pm</b>: Q: Could you talk a little bit about the market conditions on notebooks and desktops, and then any color that you can share regarding the timing of the Mac through M3 MacBook Pros this year versus the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> earlier in the calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
A: We're thrilled to have announced M3 lineup. Get the new MacBook Pro and the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> out there. <br/>
<br/>
We anticipate a significant acceleration in Mac for Q1. In the year-ago June quarter, we had a factory disruption that lasted several weeks. The pent-up demand that resulted from that was filled in September quarter. And that made the September quarter not only record but a substantial record and obviously, we're now comparing against that for 2023 and I wouldn't look at the negative 34% growth as representative of the underlying business performance."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:31 pm</b>: Q: Could you help us characterize what the demand environment you're seeing in China looks like, how has the reception been to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and how would you characterize the mix within China as you go through this current product cycle?<br/>
<br/>
A: One thing to keep in mind here is that the FX impact was nearly six points. So we grew in constant currency and underneath that, if you look at the different categories, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; actually set a September quarter record, and in mainland China, what pulled down the performance was a combination largely of Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. Services also grew during the quarter and the Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; suffered from the same issues that the company did with the compare issues to 2022."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: As we move towards more of an inflationary component pricing environment, how do we think about that effect or how you're thinking about the gross margin at the product level? <br/>
<br/>
As maybe component pricing starts to turn what has been clearly very favorable over the last several quarters to more of an inflationary environment. <br/>
<br/>
A: Well as you've seen from our results in Q4 and the guidance for Q1, we're obviously experiencing very strong levels of gross margin.  The 45.2 was a record for this September quarter. And then you know the guidance for Q1 is obviously strong at 45 to 46%. Gross margins are affected by multiple factors. Obviously, the commodity environment is one of them. as you mentioned. It's been a good environment In recent quarters, But equally important is the mix of what we sell. Growth in services for us is favorable and that has helped our company gross margin. Foreign exchange, on the other hand, has been a drag for several quarters given the strength of the dollar.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: I know that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max are constrained today but I think some of your comments suggests you shouldn't be back to supply-demand balance before quarter end. Does your December quarter revenue guidance account for any supply constraints? And if so, is there any way to kind of quantify how much supply would be limiting your December quarter revenue performance?<br/>
<br/>
A: We are constrained today on &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. We're working very hard to get the product in the hands of all the customers that have ordered it. We expect, as of today, that we're going to be in supply-demand balance by the end of the quarter, so the guidance reflects that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:35 pm</b>: Q: You've been on the leading edge of innovation across hardware, software, and services, and technologies and kind of longer-term projects that you're investing in. How should we think about your capital intensity as we look to fiscal year 2024, as over the last few years, capex as a percentage of revenue has been relatively low compared to the eight years prior.<br/>
<br/>
Should we expect a step up in capital-investment intensity and what are the more notable moving pieces that we should be thinking about?<br/>
<br/>
A: The big areas of investment for us are tooling and equipment for manufacturing plants, our investments in data centers, and our investments in our own facilities, both corporate facilities and retail stores. <br/>
<br/>
And so both for the tooling in our plants and you know, our data center investments, we tend to have a bit of a hybrid model where we share some of the investments with our partners, and suppliers. So maybe that's why you see sometimes a bit of variability. But over the last few years, we made all the investments that we need to make and we're planning to make all the investments that we believe are needed and appropriate in order to continue to innovate.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:38 pm</b>: Q: &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; business looks like it returned to growth in the quarter. But it's still relatively softer than where I would thought it would be at this point in the cycle. Some of the US carriers obviously haven't been particularly aggressive in promoting upgrades. I wanted to kind of get a sense from your partners in the US currently and going forward and what do you expect on upgrades?<br/>
<br/>
Is it fair to say that the mix in Q1 from a product versus services dynamic is kind of the key driver of the better gross margin guide as a whole relative to the December quarter, or is there anything else? I know you mentioned there's a lot of moving pieces, but is that the primary driver of the uplift in the margins?<br/>
<br/>
A: On the US carriers and the US business in general, it's really too early to call the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cycle, particularly with the constraint around the Pro and Pro Max in the US tends to do quite well with those products. It's really too early to tell what the upgrade rates will be and what the switcher rates will be. <br/>
<br/>
December is the quarter where our products business is tends to be very heavy because of the holiday season and so the Services gross margin has an impact but not as meaningful as other quarters during the year. And so I think that the the main drivers of the guidance that we provided are the fact that we are seeing improved costs and improved margin on the product side of the business, partially offset by foreign exchange which continues to be a drag both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:40 pm</b>: Q: The Services growth rate was a tremendous acceleration in September quarter to 16% growth. Can you talk about what is driving this acceleration? Are there a couple of products that have stepped up in a very meaningful way? What is driving the situation? It's very notable compared to what you've been seeing the last few quarters.<br/>
<br/>
A: We had a really strong quarter across the board both geographically and from a product category standpoint. We had all-time records for the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, for advertising, for &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, video, &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;, and payments, and a September quarter record for Music, so it's hard to pick one in particular because they all did well.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:42 pm</b>: Q: About Vision Pro, which I believe is supposed to be launched more broadly sometime in 2024 in the early part of the year. <br/>
<br/>
I'm curious how different you think the launch and the consumer education of this product. How will it be versus other things like AirPods or Apple Watch that you've done, and then perhaps what has stood out to you from the developers that have been able to use this and the developer labs, what feedback have you gotten from them?<br/>
<br/>
A: There's a tremendous amount of excitement around the Vision Pro and we've been very happy to share it with developers. We have Developer Labs set up in different parts of the world so that they can actually get their hands on it and are working on apps, and I've been fortunate enough to see a number of those. To answer your question about is it similar to AirPods or Apple Watch? I would say no. There's never been a product like Vision Pro and so we're purposely bringing it out in our stores only so we can put a great deal of attention on the last mile of it. We'll be offering demos in the stores and it'll be a very different process than the normal grab-and-go kind of purchase.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:44 pm</b>: Q: Lots of companies are experimenting with generative AI. I'm curious about what kind of efforts you have made, I was curious about if you can give us a glimpse on how you might be able to monetize some of these efforts with generative AI.<br/>
<br/>
A: If you zoom out and look at what we've done on AI and machine learning and how we've used it, we view AI and machine learning as fundamental technologies, and they're integral to virtually every product that we ship. <br/>
<br/>
When we shipped &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, it had features like personal voice and live voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features and then you can go all the way to the life-saving features on the watch and the phone, like fall detection, crash detection. ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI.<br/>
<br/>
We don't label them as such, we labeled them as to what their consumer benefit is. But the fundamental technology behind it is is AI and machine learning. In terms of generative AI, we have obviously we have work going on but I'm not going to get into details about what it is because as you know, we don't we really don't do that. <br/>
<br/>
But you can bet that we're investing quite a bit. We're going to do it responsibly.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:47 pm</b>: Q: Over the last decade, you can source a lot of important chips in your iPhones, in Macs, in iPads, and so forth. Now we see these silicon guys, the chip guys, moving to ARM architecture. So my question to you is, for silicon in general, is it an economically profitable proposition for Apple or as a strategic one for you to own this? And is it vital to your products for the consumer experience or could you buy from the industry?<br/>
<br/>
A: Apple silicon has really enabled us to build products that we could not build without doing it ourselves. We like to own the primary technologies in the products that we ship. And arguably Apple silicon is at the heart of the primary technologies. And so no, I don't see going back to buying off the shelf. I am happier today than I was yesterday than I was last week that we made the transition that we've made and I see the benefit every day of it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:49 pm</b>: Q: You obviously had a great Services quarter and part of your Services business has these licensing relationships. <br/>
<br/>
On web search partners, you serve a very important distribution function for them. Can you talk about how you think about these relationships and potentially some of the options Apple has to mitigate some of the risks, given some of the scrutiny on what some of these search partners are doing?<br/>
<br/>
A: They are important relationships, and as you know, we don't get into our commercial relationships in the call.  I see them as important, and we make decisions that we feel are in the best interests of our users.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:51 pm</b>: Q: Is there room for margin expansion? As revenue has declined, gross margins have improved.<br/>
<br/>
A: On the product side, when we launch new products, the cost structures of those products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. <br/>
<br/>
It happens because we're always adding new technologies and new features. And then we work through the cost curve over the over the lifecycle of the product and we tend to get benefits as time goes by. The guidance that we provided for December reflects all that and so we are starting from a different position than a year ago or in the past in general. <br/>
<br/>
There are other factors that play a role. For example, the mix of products that we sell. Not every product has the same gross margin profile. And so our guidance our results are reflective of that and also within a specific product category. A lot depends on the kind of models that we sell because they are different margin profiles.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the things that we've done well over the last few years is to offer more affordability solutions to our customers in the form of installment plans, trade-in options and low cost financing in general. And what that has accomplished is reduced the affordability threshold for our customers and therefore they can you know buy at the top of our product ranges. That has been a big factor in the reason for our margin expansion.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:53 pm</b>: Q: Seeing amazing momentum in India. How do you look at look at the India growth opportunity on these hardware units? How should we think about ASP versus the rest of the geographies and is there a way to compare and contrast India with China?<br/>
<br/>
A: This is China maybe a decade ago. We had an all-time revenue record in India, we grossed very strong double digits. It's an incredibly exciting market for us, and a major focus of ours. We have small share in a large market and so it would seem that there's a lot of headroom there.<br/>
<br/>
The ASPs, I haven't looked at them recently but I'm sure that they're lower than worldwide. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of the similarity, I would say each country has its own journey and I wouldn't want to play the comparison game but we see an extraordinary market with a lot of people moving into the middle class. Distribution is getting better. We put two retail stores there and they're doing better than we anticipated. It's still early going, but they're off to a good start and I couldn't be happier with how things are going at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:56 pm</b>: Q: I appreciate all your commentary around China. It was great to kind of hear about the growth potential there and your optimism. What about the supply chain and where is your priority? Do you have a priority to diversify your supply chain and how do you feel about Apple's supply chain around the world in particular, what do you think about the investments in the US?<br/>
<br/>
A: You know, our supply chain is truly global. We're investing all over the world, including in the United States. We were very focused on advanced manufacturing for the US and we've worked on a number of different projects in the US, whether it's our venture with Corning on the glass, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> module, or semiconductors. And so all of these are our advanced manufacturing and I think they're exactly the kinds of things that you would think the US would be very good at. <br/>
<br/>
We also invest in other regions of the world and we're continually optimizing the chain. At the moment we learn something didn't work exactly right, we're tweaking it. And so we're we're gonna continue to do that. But at the end of the day, it will still be a global supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:58 pm</b>: Q: Really quick on the extra week dynamic. There was, last year, an issue with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; production when there were the COVID lockdowns in China. Is it possible to give some color around what having a normalized supply chain somewhat this year?<br/>
<br/>
A: The extra week is seven points of revenue. We did have supply disruptions last year on the phone. And then the 14th week in the December quarter a year ago. <br/>
<br/>
When we normalize for those two factors, and I said it during the call, we still expect to grow on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. You take into account the loss of a week, you compare it with supply disruptions that are not going to repeat hopefully this year, and when you normalize for those two things, we still expect to grow on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:59 pm</b>: Q: Where is the growth in R&D coming from? Is that Vision Pro or content or new services?<br/>
<br/>
A: It's Vision Pro, it's AI and ML. It's the silicon investment that we're making. It's sort of all of those things, and I think you would find that the R&D expenditure in the aggregate looks very competitive versus others. Some of the investments that we're making in R&D are also the drivers for the gross margin expansion. I think it's important to think about it that way.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3:02 pm</b>: Q: Tim mentioned college students choosing Macs and you mentioned the record Services revenue. What metrics do you think you could provide to help investors understand how Apple measures customer lifetime value, especially when we see a lot of users entering the ecosystem with a relatively lower price products or even refurbished devices? You're growing your ecosystem, but how do you think about growing customer lifetime value over the long run? <br/>
<br/>
A: We want to make sure that you know the customers that we acquire remain with us. We pay a lot of attention to the behavior of the install base, both by product and by geography. Then we look at the daily engagement in the ecosystem. That's why we pay a lot of attention to things like transacting accounts, paid accounts. We want to see if we are able to move our customers from a free model to a paid model over time. That's obviously very, very important for us. <br/>
<br/>
We keep track of all these things and, you know, then what we do, because I think what's really important is that over time we add new services. The progress that we made in payments in recent years is very important because we've attracted more people that are actually now using additional features on our devices and we are able to monetize that.<br/>
<br/>
We take all that into account. We understand what happens when a customer joins us, when they buy a primary device versus a used device. We understand their behavior in different markets and so on. We have pretty good visibility and I think the progress that we're making in Services, with &#36;85 billion in the last 12 months, that's the size of a Fortune 50. Significantly bigger than it was just a couple of years ago.<br/>
<br/>
