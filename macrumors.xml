		<description><![CDATA[It is Friday, March 8 in New Zealand and Australia, which means customers who pre-ordered one of the new machines in those two countries are receiving their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-2-up-hero-240304-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939443" /><br/>
Introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">on Monday of this week</a>, the updated 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models are equipped with the same M3 chip that was introduced in the MacBook Pro late last year.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2-vs-m3-macbook-air/">M2 vs. M3 MacBook Air Buyer's Guide: All Differences Compared</a></li><br/>
</ul><br/>
There are no external changes to the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, with Apple instead focusing on internal updates. The M3 chip is up to 30 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip in terms of CPU performance, and there are notable GPU improvements with Apple adding support for Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, hardware-accelerated mesh shading, and support for AV1 decode.<br/>
<br/>
Other improvements to the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; include support for two external displays when the machine is used in clamshell mode, support for Wi-Fi 6E, enhanced voice clarity for audio and video calls, and a new anodization seal to reduce fingerprints on the Midnight finish.<br/>
<br/>
Apple retail stores in Australia are selling the new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; machines, and there is plenty of stock for walk-in customers. Apple does not operate stores in New Zealand, so customers in that country need to order online.<br/>
<br/>
Following New Zealand and Australia, sales and deliveries of the new â€Œ&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models will launch in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be sharing a hands-on review of the new M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; in the morning after picking up one of the new devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/m3-macbook-air-new-zealand-australia/">M3 MacBook Air Models Now Arriving to Customers in New Zealand and Australia</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-macbook-air-models-now-arriving-to-customers-in-new-zealand-and-australia.2421330/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models that are set to be released tomorrow will have a day-one update, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/macbook-air-blue-image.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937843" /><br/>
Both the 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models that are set to launch tomorrow are running a special build of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.3, with a version number of 23D2057.<br/>
<br/>
Users will be prompted to update to &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4 tomorrow, as the software saw a public release today. Given the timing of the software's launch and the debut of the new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models, Apple was not able to get the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4 update installed on them.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models are priced starting at &#36;1099 for the 13-inch version and &#36;1299 for the 15-inch version. Customers who pre-ordered will receive their machines on March 8, which is also when the new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models will be available in Apple retail locations.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/macbook-air-day-one-macos-update/">New M3 MacBook Air Models to Have Day-One macOS Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-m3-macbook-air-models-to-have-day-one-macos-update.2421325/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Developing New Accessibility Features for iOS 18 and macOS 15</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With every operating system release, Apple aims to make apps more accessible and easier to navigate by providing a variety of new accessibility features and settings. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> (Codename Crystal) and macOS 15 (Codename Glow) will be no exception, and work on accessibility-related enhancements is well underway.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-18-Roundup-Article.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924585" /><br/>
Through our industry sources, <em>MacRumors</em> has obtained information on some of the key accessibility improvements Apple has in store for its userbase. Apple is working on several new accessibility features along with improvements to existing settings, both of which should be available later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Adaptive Voice Shortcuts</h2><br/>
This feature will allow users to map a unique spoken phrase to an accessibility setting. Users will be given the option to create a custom phrase and select the accessibility setting they wish to toggle by speaking said phrase. By using Adaptive Voice Shortcuts, users will be able to toggle existing accessibility features such as VoiceOver, Voice Control, Zoom and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New "Categories" Section for Live Speech</h2><br/>
The Live Speech feature, which is already present in Apple's operating systems, will receive a new section for user-created categories. Users will be able to organize phrases into categories of their choosing. When creating a category, users will be given the option to name their category and choose from a selection of around 20 different icons. Once a category has been created, users will then be able to add their desired phrases.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Apps Will Support Custom Font Sizes</h2><br/>
Apple intends to expand app support for adjustable Text Size, which is an existing feature. Located within the "Display" section of the "Accessibility" settings pane, the option allows users to choose custom font sizes for individual apps and select their preferred font size for reading.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> currently supports custom font sizes for the following five apps:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Calendar<br/>
<li>Finder<br/>
<li>Mail<br/>
<li>Messages<br/>
<li>Notes</ul><br/>
<br/>
With macOS 15, this feature will expand support to five additional apps:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Books<br/>
<li>News<br/>
<li>Stocks<br/>
<li>Tips<br/>
<li>Weather</ul><br/>
<br/>
Speaking to <em>MacRumors</em>, sources familiar with custom font sizes have said that Apple is internally testing an option to alter the font size of the menu bar within macOS, but it is unclear if the company will make this option available to end users. We were also told that Apple has additional accessibility features in the works, one of which utilizes on-device eye tracking, though further details were not available at the time of writing. More information should come to light as OS development continues in preparation for WWDC 2024.<br/>
<br/>
It is important to note that while these features are in development, it does not necessarily mean we will see them later this year. Apple has been known to cancel various projects that do not meet their standards, for one reason or another.

		<title>Apple to Let EU iPhone Users Delete Safari and More Easily Transition to Android</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In addition to adding support for alternative app marketplaces and alternative payment methods in the European Union, Apple is making several other changes to comply with the terms of the Digital Markets Act. Apple today outlined some of its upcoming plans in a DMA Compliance Report [<a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/dma/dma-ncs.pdf">PDF</a>].<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/transfer-to-android.jpg" alt="" width="1240" height="698" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940141" /><br/>
Apple is going to make it easier for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to switch over to another operating system in the European Union. Apple says it is working on a solution that will help mobile operating system providers create "more user-friendly solutions" for transferring data from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to a non-Apple phone. The solution will be available by fall 2025, after which point companies like Samsung and Google will be able to offer better tools for transferring data from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
EU &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users will be able to remove Safari from their devices entirely starting at the end of 2024, with an alternate browser able to take the place of Safari. As part of this plan, Apple is developing a browser switching solution for exporting and importing browser data into another browser on the same device. Apple has already began supporting alternative web browser engines, another DMA requirement.<br/>
<br/>
To improve interoperability between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and other smartphone platforms, Apple is allowing third-party payment apps to access the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s NFC chip for contactless payments that are not done through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, plus it is allowing developers to submit requests for additional interoperability.<br/>
<br/>
Interoperability requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they are under the scope of the DMA, and if an effective interoperability solution can be developed.<br/>
<br/>
Developers in the EU are able to <a href="https://www.cedr.com">request additional mediation</a> that goes beyond the standard App Review Board evaluation. Developers who want to contest unsuccessful appeals to the App Review Board can request mediation, a process that Apple says is "EU-based, easily accessible, impartial, independent, and free-of-charge."<br/>
<br/>
All of these changes are limited to developers and users in the European Union as they are required by the Digital Markets Act.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-eu-safari-android-changes/">Apple to Let EU iPhone Users Delete Safari and More Easily Transition to Android</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-let-eu-iphone-users-delete-safari-and-more-easily-transition-to-android.2421315/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new software for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, debuting &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; Software 17.4. The update comes over a month after the last &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; software release.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-Midnight-Closeup-Feature-Purple-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881769" /><br/>
With &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; Software 17.4, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is able to learn what a user's preferred media service is, eliminating the need to set a third-party app as the default or include an app name when asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to play content.<blockquote>This update enables Siri to learn your preferred media service, so you no longer need to include the name of the media app in your request.</blockquote>Apple has removed the Home app option that let users select a default media service as a result of the new feature addition. The change brings the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; in line with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, which already offer the option to provide a default music service selection to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; when making a song request for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Third-party apps that work directly with the â€Œ&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;â€Œ include YouTube Music, Deezer, Pandora, TuneIn, and iHeartRadio. Streaming music services need to support â€Œ&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;â€Œ for the feature to work, and not all do, such as Spotify. You can play Spotify content on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; by asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, but it routes the song through the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Along with â€Œ&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;â€Œ support for a preferred music service, the â€Œ&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;â€Œ 17.4 update also includes performance and stability improvements.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-4/">Apple Releases HomePod Software 17.4 With Music Preference Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-4-with-music-preference-update.2421308/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released tvOS 17.4, the fourth major update to the tvOS 17 operating system that came out last September. tvOS 17.4 comes over a month after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-releases-tvos-17-3/">release of tvOS 17.3</a>.<br/>

tvOS 17.4 can be downloaded using the Settings app on the â€Œ<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>â€Œ. Go to System &gt; Software Update to get the new software. â€Œ&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;â€Œ owners who have automatic software updates activated will be upgraded to tvOS 17.4 automatically.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to other operating system updates, tvOS 17.4 updates are often minor in scale, focusing on bug fixes and other small improvements. We did not find new features during the tvOS 17.4 beta testing process.<br/>

		<title>iOS Apps From Alternative Marketplaces Can Be Updated for 30 Days Outside of EU</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118110">today clarified</a> that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the European Union can continue to update and use apps from alternative app marketplaces for a 30-day period when leaving the EU.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
With the release of iOS 17.4, Apple published a number of support documents, and one of the pages <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/alternative-ios-app-stores-eu-grace-period/">outlined what happens</a> when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user with apps installed through an alternative app marketplace leaves the EU. At the time, the document said that there would be an unspecified "grace period," but Apple has now updated it to provide exact timing.<br/>
<br/>
EU &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who travel outside of the area can expect to be able to update apps installed through alternative app marketplaces for a 30-day period, but after that, apps will not be able to be updated.<br/>
<br/>
Installing alternative app marketplaces and the apps in those marketplaces is restricted to the European Union at all times, so travelers will not be able to install new apps through a marketplace while out of their home country or one of the 27 countries in the EU. Apps that have been downloaded can continue to be opened and used, even if they can't be updated.<blockquote>If you leave the European Union, you can continue to open and use apps that you previously installed from alternative app marketplaces. Alternative app marketplaces can continue updating those apps for up to 30 days after you leave the European Union, and you can continue using alternative app marketplaces to manage previously installed apps. However, you must be in the European Union to install alternative app marketplaces and new apps from alternative app marketplaces.</blockquote><br/>
Apple makes it clear that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who want to install apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> must be physically located in a country in the European Union and their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> must also be set to a country or region in the EU. Apple uses privacy-focused on-device processing to determine whether a user is eligible to install an alternative app marketplace.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/alternative-apps-30-day-update-period/">iOS Apps From Alternative Marketplaces Can Be Updated for 30 Days Outside of EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-apps-from-alternative-marketplaces-can-be-updated-for-30-days-outside-of-eu.2421304/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip</a> launch this Friday. Ahead of time, the first reviews and unboxing videos  for the laptops have been shared by some media outlets and YouTube channels.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/macbook-air-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939665" /><br/>
Key new features added to both MacBook Air models include Apple's M3 chip for faster performance, Wi-Fi 6E support, expanded external display support, an anodization seal that reduces fingerprints on the Midnight finish, and microphone improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Reviews</h2><br/>
<h3>M3 Chip</h3><br/>
Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air are now available with the M3 chip for faster performance and improved power efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
As expected, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/first-benchmark-result-macbook-air-m3/">early benchmark result</a> revealed that the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip in the previous MacBook Air models in terms of CPU performance. These results are consistent with the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Jason Snell shared benchmark results in his <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-review-more-of-a-good-thing/">review on <em>Six Colors</em></a>:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Six-Colors-M3-MacBook-Air.jpg" alt="" width="1382" height="1338" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940059" /><br/>
With the M3 chip, the MacBook Air has also gained hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games, along with AV1 video decoding.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Two External Displays</h3><br/>
While previous MacBook Air models with Apple silicon officially support only one external display, the new models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-two-displays-lid-closed/">support two external displays</a>. However, a second display can only be used when the MacBook Air's lid is closed.<br/>
<br/>
When the lid is open, the new models support one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz. When the lid is closed, a second display with up to 5K resolution at 60Hz can be connected, according to Apple's tech specs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-MacBook-Air-Two-External-Displays.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="676" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940064" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image Credit: CNET</em></div><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-inch-2024-review-the-everything-laptop/"><em>CNET</em>'s Joshua Goldman</a>:<blockquote>With the M3 MacBook Airs, you can connect two external displays directly to the Thunderbolt USB-C ports, which will also power the MacBook. <br/>
<br/>
However, doing this comes at the cost of the MacBook Air's display; the lid must be closed in order to drive both external monitors. On the surface, this doesn't seem like much of an issue, unless you typically use your laptop's keyboard and trackpad while working on an external display. For me, the bigger hiccup is the loss of Touch ID on the Air's keyboard. You can just open and close the lid to use Touch ID, but I use mine so much during the day that that would get old really fast. The better option is to get Apple's Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, and while you're at it, pick up a Magic Trackpad or Mouse to complete the package.</blockquote>Even more displays can be connected to the MacBook Air with the use of DisplayLink adapters. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Fingerprint Seal for Midnight Color</h3><br/>
Just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/">like the Space Black MacBook Pro</a>, the Midnight MacBook Air now features an "anodization seal to reduce fingerprints," according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.thestreet.com/technology/apple-13-inch-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review"><em>TheStreet</em>'s Jacob Krol</a>:<blockquote>Thus far, it's clear that the anodization blocks most fingerprint smudges, and the M3 looks better than an M2 in the Midnight color. However, Midnight is a harder color to block all of them, as I am still seeing some, specifically on the top and bottom cases of the 15-inch. That being said, on the inside around the keyboard and on or off the trackpad, it does a really good job of stopping them.</blockquote><h3>Wi-Fi 6E</h3><br/>
The new MacBook Airs support Wi-Fi 6E for "up to twice as fast" wireless download speeds compared to the previous models with Wi-Fi 6, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible device and router. The entire current-generation Mac lineup now supports Wi-Fi 6E.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Microphone Upgrades</h3><br/>
Apple says the microphones in the new MacBook Air models offer "enhanced voice clarity in audio and video calls" compared to the previous models. The microphones also gained support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/block-background-noise-facetime-mac/">"Voice Isolation" and "Wide Spectrum" modes</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The European Commission has requested "further explanations" from Apple over its decision yesterday to <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account">terminate the developer account</a> of Epic Games, the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b0655af4-833e-4434-a6f4-5e198f914537">Financial Times</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
The EC said it was investigating under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a new law aimed at curbing the power of the biggest online platforms. Tech companies faced a March 7 deadline to comply with the legislation. The Commission added that it was also evaluating whether Apple's actions might have breached other EU laws. <br/>
<br/>
Apple on Wednesday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/apple-explains-terminating-epic-games-account/">announced</a> the termination of Epic Games Sweden's developer account on a global scale, citing the game developer's recurrent untrustworthy actions. Apple said courts had previously granted Apple the authority to end the accounts of any of Epic's subsidiaries due to contractual infractions.<br/>
<br/>
The move thwarted Epic's plan to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/epic-games-store-ios-eu/">launch an Epic Games Store on iOS in the EU</a> and bring its Fortnite game back to the iPhone, which it claimed was in line with new EU regulations allowing for alternative app marketplaces on iOS. Starting with iOS 17.4, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">allows alternative app marketplaces on the iPhone in the EU</a>, as part of its compliance with the DMA. Epic argues that Apple's account termination violates the DMA and significantly limits competition on iOS devices.<br/>
<br/>
Epic condemned Apple's decision as a violation of competitive principles, interpreting it as evidence of Apple's unwillingness to allow legitimate competition on its platform. The company claimed Apple's action was an attempt to eliminate a major potential rival to the App Store.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's action was the latest in a broader legal conflict that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">started in 2020</a> when Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store for bypassing its payment system rules. In retaliation, Epic launched lawsuits in the U.S. and Australia, accusing Apple of anti-competitive behavior. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/eu-probes-apple-termination-epic-account/">EU Probes Apple&#039;s Decision to Shut Down Epic&#039;s Developer Account</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-probes-apples-decision-to-shut-down-epics-developer-account.2421267/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to release a 20-inch MacBook with a foldable screen in around three years, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
"Apple's only foldable product with a clear development schedule is the 20.3-inch MacBook, expected to enter mass production in 2027," said Kuo, <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1765563986089783322">in a post on X today</a>. He did not provide any additional details about the device.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo is the third source to mention the possibility of a 20-inch MacBook, alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/31/apple-foldable-notebook-2025/">display industry analyst Ross Young</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-20-inch-display-future-macbook-pro/">Korean website <em>The Elec</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
The largest laptop that Apple currently sells is the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The company also once offered a 17-inch MacBook Pro, which was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2012/06/11/apple-quietly-discontinues-macbook-pro-17/">discontinued in 2012</a>. The new foldable MacBook would have a screen that measures around 20 inches diagonally when fully expanded, but Kuo did not provide any details about the device's exact design.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the 20-inch MacBook is Apple's only foldable product with a clear development schedule, suggesting that a foldable iPhone or iPad are not coming any time soon.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/">Foldable MacBook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/20-inch-macbook-kuo/">Kuo: Apple Planning 20-Inch MacBook With Foldable Screen</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-planning-20-inch-macbook-with-foldable-screen.2421253/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Drake Bennett today published an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-03-06/apple-car-s-crash-design-details-tim-cook-s-indecision-failed-tesla-deal">in-depth report</a> examining Apple's decade-long attempt at creating an electric vehicle. The project was reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">canceled last week</a> after many challenges and setbacks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/Apple-car-wheel-icon-Kevin-Lynch-feature-blue-revamp.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839900" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple vice president Kevin Lynch, who oversaw the electric vehicle project in its later years</em></div><br/>
The report described a 2020 prototype of Apple's electric vehicle:<blockquote>The prototype, a white minivan with rounded sides, an all-glass roof, sliding doors and whitewall tires, was designed to comfortably seat four people and inspired by the classic flower-power Volkswagen microbus. The design was referred to within Apple, not always affectionately, as the Bread Loaf. The plan was for the vehicle to hit the market some five years later with a giant TV screen, a powerful audio system and windows that adjusted their own tint. The cabin would have club seating like a private plane, and passengers would be able to turn some of the seats into recliners and footrests.</blockquote>Apple once considered acquiring Tesla to bolster its efforts, the report said:<blockquote>But before sketching out its own designs, Apple considered acquiring Tesla. At that point the electric-car maker's success was far from assured, and its value was less than &#36;30 billion, or a 20th of what it is today. Adrian Perica, Apple's head of corporate development, held a series of meetings with Elon Musk. But Cook, who'd succeeded Jobs three years earlier, shut the deal down while negotiations were still at an early stage.</blockquote>Apple also considered partnering with or acquiring Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Ford, Volkswagen, McLaren, and other automakers, according to the report:<blockquote>Talks with Mercedes-Benz progressed further. For a few months, Apple and the German automaker actively worked on a partnership similar to the Tesla idea, but with a twist. Mercedes would manufacture Apple's vehicle, while it would also sell its own cars with Apple's self-driving platform and user interface. Apple eventually pulled out, in part because the early work gave its executives confidence they could build a car on their own, people involved in the failed deal say.</blockquote>The project was ultimately a "failure" due to indecision, the report said:<blockquote>But Apple never got close to realizing its original vision, or any of its subsequent ones. It didn't get as far as testing a full-scale prototype on public roads. That it didn't is partly thanks to the enormous technical difficulty of its self-driving goals, as well as the punishing economics of the automaking business. The project was also a failure, at the highest levels of the company, to settle on one thing and do it.</blockquote>The report detailed how Apple's COO Jeff Williams and Apple Car chief Kevin Lynch broke the  news of the project's cancellation to employees:<blockquote>The meeting lasted about 12 minutes. Both men thanked the staffers for their work and got straight to the reorg and layoffs. Some employees would immediately get shifted to Apple's AI division, and some would move over to software engineering. A chunk of the team, though, was immediately without a job. Hardware engineers would have the opportunity to apply for roles in other groups, but there aren't spots for everyone. Other employees, such as the hundreds of car-specific engineers, test track technicians, self-driving car testers and automotive safety experts, received emails with their severance packages. As for the Arizona track, Apple is already working to sell it.</blockquote>Other notable details mentioned in the report include that Steve Jobs was apparently first to raise the idea of Apple building a vehicle, and that some Apple employees received a tour of Jay Leno's garage and his car collection early on.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 190 includes fixes and updates for CSS, History, HTML, JavaScript, Media, Networking, SVG, URLs, Web API, and Web Inspector.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Belkin this week released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/belkin-iphone-magsafe-mount-for-apple-tv/">new iPhone Mount with MagSafe</a>, which is designed to attach to a television for use with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> Mount lets you use your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as a camera for your &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Belkin iPhone MagSafe Stand" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MdByMW-lVX0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Apple actually showed off this mount when it introduced &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, but it hasn't been available for purchase until now, and there hasn't been an official solution for mounting an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to a television set.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HR1V2ZM/A/belkin-iphone-mount-with-magsafe-for-apple-tv-4k">Priced at &#36;49.95</a>, the Belkin &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mount has a bracket that is able to attach to a TV or a display that's up to four inches thick, or it can be used with a pedestal as a standalone mount next to a TV.<br/>
<br/>
It's super simple to use the mount, and you just need to pop it on the TV and then stick your MagSafe-enabled &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the mount. You can adjust the tilt from -20 to +30 degrees for the perfect filming angle, and it works in either portrait or landscape mode.<br/>
<br/>
We tested the mount with &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;, but it is also compatible with any Continuity Camera-supported apps. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; activates automatically as the camera in &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; or another supported app, and all you need to do is be signed in with the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> on both devices.<br/>
<br/>
Note that using an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as a camera for an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; requires the second-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K or later with tvOS 17, and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>) running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or later.<br/>
<br/>
Using a TV for &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; is great if you're FaceTiming with multiple people or for SharePlay sessions, and there are options to set up a split-screen layout when using &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;. The mount and the Continuity Camera feature work with Center Stage, and reactions like fireworks are supported.<br/>
<br/>
Large-screen &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; is definitely an experience that's worth trying out if you tend to do a lot of video calling. <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HR1V2ZM/A/belkin-iphone-mount-with-magsafe-for-apple-tv-4k"> Apple is selling the Belkin Mount</a> for &#36;49.95, and it's shipping out almost immediately.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/">Belkin</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/facetime-apple-tv-belkin-magsafe-iphone-mount/">Testing FaceTime on Apple TV With Belkin&#039;s New MagSafe iPhone Mount</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-facetime-on-apple-tv-with-belkins-new-magsafe-iphone-mount.2421225/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
