		<description><![CDATA[After spending a decade <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">developing an autonomous car</a>, Apple this week decided it was time to pull an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/">AirPower</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">shut down the project</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a> is no more, and Apple is no longer planning to release an Apple-branded electric vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774145" /><br/>
The hundreds of engineers and car experts who were working on the vehicle will be laid off or distributed to other teams within Apple, including the AI team. The &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; is one of the longest running rumors that we've been reporting on without a product materializing, so we thought we'd take a look back at some of the key moments in the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;'s history to provide some insight into what went wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2015_-_early_development">2015 - Early Development</h2><br/>
In early 2015, a van leased to Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/04/mysterious-apple-car/">surfaced on the streets</a> of Concord, California with LiDAR equipment on its roof. Apple had been using vans like this for mapping purposes, but the hardware looked similar to hardware being used by companies testing self-driving software. This one vehicle sighting ended up sparking a slew of rumors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2015/04/winningappleconceptcar1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-445134" /><em><div class="center-wrap">An imagined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/04/07/designers-fanciful-apple-car-concepts/">Apple Car concept</a></div></em><br/>
That same month, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/09/apple-project-tesla-competitor/">unnamed Apple employee</a> told <em>Business Insider</em> that Apple would "give Tesla a run for its money," and <em>Financial Times</em> claimed that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/13/apple-automotive-research-lab/">was recruiting</a> automotive technology and vehicle design experts to work in a "top-secret research lab." <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/13/apple-working-on-electric-car/">then broke a story</a> with in-depth details on the hundreds of employees working on an Apple-branded minivan-like electric vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
There were a number of other key headlines and details shared in 2015.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> reportedly approved the self-driving car project in 2014.</li><br/>
 <li>At the time, the project was led by Steve Zadesky, Apple VP of Product Design and a former Ford engineer. It was overseen by Dan Riccio, Apple's SVP of hardware engineering.</li><br/>
 <li>In 2015, <em>Bloomberg</em> said that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/19/apple-car-production-2020/">hoping to produce the car</a> by 2020. Later, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/21/apple-car-development-speeds-up/">the WSJ said</a> it could be ready as soon as 2019.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple was said to be meeting with Magna Steyr, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/05/bmw-denies-i3-apple-car-report/">BMW</a>, and automotive companies as it sought a partner.</li><br/>
 <li><em>The Guardian</em> published a report that Apple wasn't just working on an electric vehicle, it was working on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/08/14/apple-car-test-track-discussions/">autonomous vehicle</a>. The report also said that Apple had prototypes ready for testing, which wasn't accurate.</li><br/>
 <li>Former General Motors CEO Dan Akerson said that Apple was underestimating the difficulty of operating in the car business. "They have no idea what they're getting into," he said.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple hired a ton of vehicle experts from automotive companies and from companies with expertise in autonomous vehicles.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple's "secret" car headquarters <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/13/apple-car-hq-sunnyvale/">were located</a> in Sunnyvale, California, close to the Infinite Loop campus.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2016_and_2017_-_first_signs_of_strife_lead_to_major_upheaval">2016 and 2017 - First Signs of Strife Lead to Major Upheaval</h2><br/>
The first hints of trouble with the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; project surfaced in January 2016, with &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; lead Steve Zadesky <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/01/22/apple-car-steve-zadesky-to-leave-apple/">departing the company</a>. Around this time, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/01/08/apple-car-cars-auto-domains/">registered several domain names</a>, including apple.car and apple.auto.<br/>
<br/>
Former Apple SVP of technologies Bob Mansfield came out of retirement <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/07/28/apple-car-autonomous-driving-system/">to head up the project</a>, and under his direction, rumors suggested that Apple was focusing on an autonomous driving system with the aim of partnering with a car manufacturer in the future. Apple kept aggressively hiring, and at this time, split development into the hardware for the car and the software that would run on it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/04/Apple-Car-front-side.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-498042" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Another &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; concept from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/14/motor-trend-apple-car-renders/">Motor Trend</a></div></em><br/>
With the transition to Mansfield's leadership, hundreds of employees were fired or reassigned, and in late 2016, there was a major upheaval. Apple "abandoned" plans to build its own vehicle and gave Mansfield's team <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/17/apple-late-2017-deadline-self-driving-system/">a 2017 deadline</a> to prove the feasibility of a self-driving system.<br/>
<br/>
In early 2017, white Lexus RX450h SUVs outfitted with LiDAR equipment and piloted by Apple employees <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/04/27/apple-self-driving-lexus-suv-spotted/">were spotted in the Bay Area</a>, and Apple has used these vehicles to test its autonomous driving systems up until now. Apple was also rumored to be testing its self-driving technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/28/apple-autonomous-vehicles-arizona-test-site/">at a facility in Arizona</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Apple's Self-Driving Car Spotted on 101 in Palo Alto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DtQcNHw-w8M" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Apple at this time was also working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/22/apple-self-driving-campus-shuttle/">building an autonomous shuttle</a> in partnership with Volkswagen to ferry employees to the Infinite Loop campus, but that was nixed.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; made the unusual decision to confirm that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/13/tim-cook-confirms-apple-autonomous-driving/">working on autonomous driving</a>. "We're focusing on autonomous systems," Cook said. "It's a core technology that we view as very important." He went on to say that it was the "mother of all AI projects," describing it as "one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on."<br/>
<h2 id="2018_and_2019_-_full_car_shelved_quiet_work_on_autonomous_driving_systems">2018 and 2019 - Full Car Shelved, Quiet Work on Autonomous Driving Systems</h2><br/>
In 2018, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/05/14/apple-expands-self-driving-car-fleet/">continued to expand</a> the number of SUVs it was using to test autonomous driving software. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; would be Apple's next "star product" and that it would launch in 2023 to 2025. Kuo claimed it would revolutionize the auto market, likening it to the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
2018 was a quiet year for the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; as Apple worked on self-driving systems behind the scenes, but toward the end of the year there was speculation that the car project was back on due to the hiring of former <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/10/former-tesla-lead-engineer-returns-to-apple/">Ford lead engineer Doug Field</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In 2019, there were little hints that the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; was still in the works. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/17/apple-car-next-generation-lidar-sensors-report/">had talks</a> with LiDAR sensor suppliers, looking for advanced designs. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/25/apple-acquires-self-driving-car-startup-drive-ai/">also purchased</a> self-driving vehicle startup Drive.ai.<br/>
<br/>
Mid-year, there was a fun rumor that Jony Ive had wanted to design the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/28/jony-ive-apple-car-without-steering-wheel/">without a steering wheel</a>, a concept that would resurface later.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2020_and_2021_-_another_leadership_shakeup_renews_interest_in_apple_car">2020 and 2021 - Another Leadership Shakeup Renews Interest in Apple Car</h2><br/>
2020 was the year of the pandemic, and for 11 months, we heard nothing about the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;. Behind the scenes though, the project was undergoing another leadership change. Bob Mansfield was out, and &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; development <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/apple-car-join-giannandrea/">shifted to John Giannandrea</a>, Apple's AI chief, with Doug Field overseeing day-to-day operations.<br/>
<br/>
In December, rumors suggested an Apple-branded vehicle <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/apple-car-production-rumored-2024/">was back on</a>, and that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/09/apple-car-tsmc-chips/">allegedly in talks</a> with well-known automotive electronics suppliers.<br/>
<br/>
2021 brought numerous rumors of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/10/apple-hyundai-apple-car-deal/">Apple partnership with Hyundai</a> for the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;, and Hyundai even confirmed the relationship before walking it back. The deal <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/apple-pauses-car-talks-hyundai-kia/">ultimately dissolved</a>, perhaps because of Hyundai's lack of discretion. Apple held talks with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/apple-car-kia-talks-georgia-assembly/">multiple Japanese automakers</a>, but no partnership materialized. For a time, there were rumors that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/02/kuo-apple-car-use-hyundai-e-gmp-platform/">Apple would use</a> Hyundai's E-GMP electric battery platform, but that didn't happen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/csm_hyundai-ev-platform-apple-car.jpg" alt="" width="1345" height="618" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-781438" /><br/>
Toward the end of the year, Doug Field left Apple, and there was yet another leadership change, with Apple Watch chief Kevin Lynch taking over under John Giannandrea.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2022_and_2023_-_steering_wheel-free_design_rumored_as_project_loses_focus">2022 and 2023 - Steering Wheel-Free Design Rumored as Project Loses Focus</h2><br/>
In 2022, &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; rumors heated up after <em>The Information</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/11/apple-car-design-rumors/">published a report</a> suggesting that Apple was working on a design with four seats that faced inward, a curved ceiling, and large seat-back screens that raised and lowered. There was talk of a car without a steering wheel or pedals.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2015/02/canoo-interior-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-826229" /><em><div class="center-wrap">&zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; was rumored to have a design similar to the Canoo, pictured in the image above. Canoo's self-driving car has no steering wheel and a limousine-like interior.</div></em><br/>
The same report said that Apple's self-driving technology was lacking, with Apple's SUVs hitting curbs, having trouble staying in their lanes, and struggling to navigate streets. One vehicle reportedly almost ran into a person.<br/>
<br/>
Late in 2022, <em>Bloomberg</em> said that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/06/apple-car-project-scaled-back-delayed/">again abandoned plans</a> for a fully autonomous vehicle, instead aiming for a self-driving mode that worked on highways. Apple was said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/06/apple-car-pricing-2026-launch/">planning an Apple Car launch for 2026</a>, offering a scaled back version of the vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than the fantastical design without a steering wheel, the car was said to have a more traditional design and a price point around &#36;100,000.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors about the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; dried up in 2023 and we heard little about it all year. In September 2023, Apple analyst &zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj; said the project had "lost all visibility," and he warned that without an acquisition, Apple would not have a chance of producing a car within the next several years.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2024_-_apple_car_in_trouble">2024 - Apple Car in Trouble</h2><br/>
In January 2024, <em>Bloomberg</em> said that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-car-scaled-down-2028-launch/">had scaled back the Apple Car design</a> a <strong>second</strong> time, forgetting plans of more advanced autonomous functionality. Apple wanted the car to be able to drive on its own on highways, but that was too ambitious. Instead, Apple settled for driver-assistance features similar to how Tesla vehicles operate, with the car offering steering and brake/acceleration support.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/vanamara-apple-car-concept3.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="808" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-828956" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/10/apple-car-3d-render-based-on-patents/">Apple Car concept</a> based on Apple's patented designs</em></div><br/>
While Apple had been aiming for a 2026 launch, with the new project changes, that was pushed to 2028. <em>Bloomberg</em> warned that if Apple decided it was unable to provide an electric vehicle with this more limited feature set, executives might cancel the project.<br/>
<br/>
Just a month after that report, Apple executives decided to go ahead and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">give up on the Apple Car</a>, focusing instead on AI. Some &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; employees will move to Apple's generative AI team, while others will be laid off or will need to apply for new positions within Apple.<br/>
<br/>
As of now, the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; joins two other canceled Apple projects - <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/29/apple-officially-cancels-airpower/">the AirPower</a> charging mat nixed in 2019 and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> set that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/05/18/apple-nixed-plans-for-television-set/">rumored for several years</a> right around 2014.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h2><br/>
Looking back at the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;'s history, it's clear that the multiple leadership changes and almost yearly redirects of the project ultimately led to Apple's decision to end work on developing a vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
Apple executives were never quite convinced of the viability of an &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; because of the enormous cost and safety risk involved with autonomous driving capabilities, and there was no one at Apple that was able to bring it to fruition.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-car-history/">Apple Car History - Where Did Development Go Wrong?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-car-history-where-did-development-go-wrong.2420682/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 Pro and/or M3 Max chips to its certified refurbished store <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">in Canada</a> and select European countries, such as <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">the UK</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/de/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Germany</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/it/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Italy</a>, for the first time since the laptops debuted in October. Availability in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/refurbished-m3-pro-m3-max-macbook-pro/">began earlier this month</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
As usual for Apple's refurbished products, these refurbished MacBook Pro models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent brand new models. A variety of configurations and color options are available in Canada, but inventory is currently more limited in Europe. The stock changes frequently, so check back often.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says it puts refurbished Macs through "full functionality testing" and a "thorough cleaning process and inspection," and they are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
In our view, Apple's refurbished Macs are virtually indistinguishable from brand new ones, providing a good opportunity for savings directly from Apple. However, larger discounts are often <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">available from resellers like Amazon</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In related news, Apple began selling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-refurbished-m3-imac/">refurbished iMac models with the M3 chip</a> in the U.S. today.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/refurbished-m3-pro-m3-max-mbps-more-countries/">Apple Now Selling Refurbished M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro Models in More Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-refurbished-m3-pro-and-m3-max-macbook-pro-models-in-more-countries.2420681/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> that is set to launch as soon as March, and the refresh will mark the biggest design update to the Pro lineup since 2018.<br/>

Apple is transitioning to OLED displays, and the swap will allow for a major change to the overall thickness of the device. CAD drawings of the upcoming ~11-inch and ~13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models give us some insight into just how thin the tablets will be.<br/>

CAD drawings of unreleased Apple devices often leak out of Apple's factories in China and other countries because the information is so valuable to case makers. Case makers use these measurements to design cases for new products in order to be the first to market with a protective case for a new device size.<br/>
<br/>

Previously leaked dimensions confirmed that the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models will be significantly thinner than the current versions. The larger &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, for example, will be over 1mm thinner.<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Current 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; - 247.6mm x 178.5mm x 5.9 mm</li><br/>
<li>Upcoming ~11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; - 249.7mm x 177.5mm x 5.1mm</li><br/>
<li>Current 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; - 280.6mm x 214.9mm x 6.4mm</li><br/>
<li>Upcoming ~13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; - 281.5mm x 215.5mm x 5.0mm</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
OLED displays will bring improved HDR, better colors, deeper blacks, and other quality improvements. Apple has so far limited OLED technology to the Apple Watch and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, so this will be the first time that OLED displays have been available in an Apple device of this size.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are also expected to be upgraded with faster 3-nanometer M3 chips, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charging is a possibility.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to be gearing up for a major rebrand of the well-known <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>, with plans to rename it to "Apple Account." Sources familiar with Apple's work have told <em>MacRumors</em> that Apple is experimenting with the new Apple Account name, and it could be introduced as soon as this year. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-ID-to-be-Renamed-to-Account-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938763" /><br/>
An &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; is an account that allows Apple users to access services such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. The option to create and log in to an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; is available across all of Apple's platforms and has been accessible to users for over a decade. With an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;, users can purchase apps and music, sync data wirelessly between devices using &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; and make purchases on Apple's online store, among other things.<br/>
<br/>
The rebrand from &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; to Apple Account is expected to occur later in 2024, likely alongside the release of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> (Codename Crystal) and macOS 15 (Codename Glow). System applications will receive modifications to reflect the change, as will Apple's website -- assuming the company chooses to implement the new branding.<br/>
<br/>
Although instances of the term "Apple Account" can be found <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111001">on Apple's website</a>, and as part of larger phrases such as "<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202359">Apple Account Balance</a>," our sources have said that Apple intends to replace existing mentions of "&zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;" with "Apple Account" as a means of rebranding the feature.<br/>
<br/>
It is currently unclear why Apple is considering this change, and  it's important to consider that Apple often has multiple marketing names ready before new services or products launch. With the operating system for the recently released Vision Pro headset, for instance, Apple used three different names in its internal testing –- realityOS, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xros/">xrOS</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>. Consequently, there is a possibility that we may not see the Apple Account branding come to fruition, for one reason or another.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held its annual shareholders meeting, and during the event, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> once again commented on Apple's AI plans. Cook said that the company will "break new ground" in generative AI in 2024. "We believe it will unlock transformative opportunities for our users," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840591" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" /><br/>
Cook has made several statements on Apple's artificial intelligence ambitions in recent months. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/tim-cook-generative-ai-comments/">Back in November</a>, he said that Apple was "investing quite a bit" in AI, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">in February</a>, he said that the company was spending a "tremendous amount of time and effort" on AI, with more details to come later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple rumors have said that Apple will add new generative AI features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, with plans to use AI to boost the capabilities of many of the built-in iOS apps.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from Cook's comments on AI, the shareholder meeting was business as usual. As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/apple-shareholders-vote-down-request-for-ai-transparency-report">noted by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, shareholders rejected a proposal asking Apple for an AI transparency report with details on whether AI is being used ethically.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's board and executive compensation plans were approved, but no shareholder proposals were accepted. Al Gore and James Bell are set to retire from Apple's board, while former Aerospace Corp. CEO Wanda Austin will join.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/tim-cook-apple-generative-ai-break-new-ground/">Tim Cook Says Apple Will &#039;Break New Ground&#039; in Generative AI</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-says-apple-will-break-new-ground-in-generative-ai.2420670/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the iMac with the M3 chip <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/2023-imac">to its certified refurbished store</a> in the U.S. for the first time since the computer was introduced in October.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-iMac-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921470" /><br/>
As usual for Apple's refurbished products, the refurbished iMacs are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent brand new models, with pricing starting at &#36;1,099. A variety of configurations and color options are available.<br/>
<br/>
All of the usual accessories are included in the box, including a Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, power adapter and cord, and USB-C to Lightning cable.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says it puts refurbished Macs through "full functionality testing" and a "thorough cleaning process and inspection," and they are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
In our view, Apple's refurbished Macs are virtually indistinguishable from brand new ones, providing a good opportunity for savings directly from Apple. However, larger discounts are sometimes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">available from resellers like Amazon</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recently began selling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro/">refurbished MacBook Pro models with the M3 chip</a>, and later models with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/refurbished-m3-pro-m3-max-macbook-pro/">M3 Pro and M3 Max chips</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-refurbished-m3-imac/">Apple Begins Selling Refurbished iMac With M3 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-refurbished-imac-with-m3-chip.2420664/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's decision to cancel its electric vehicle project has surprised ambitious new Chinese automakers like Xiaomi, the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3253542/chinese-ev-players-surprised-apples-decision-cancel-car-project-xiaomi-ceo-lei-saying-he-remains?"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-774149" /><br/>
Yesterday, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> revealed that after a decade of work and millions of dollars in development costs Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">canceled its plans</a> to bring an EV to market, moving many of the 2,000 staff working on the project to generative AI instead. The decision has come as a surprise to new tech-focused Chinese EV brands like Xiaomi, Li Auto, and Xpeng, who saw a future Apple car as one of their main rivals.<br/>
<br/>
Xiaomi is one of China's biggest electronics companies and is best known for its line of smartphones. The company unveiled its first EV, the SU7, late last year and it is set to go on sale after further testing. The project required over &#36;1.4 billion in development and over 3,400 engineers.<br/>
<br/>
Founder and chairman Lei Jun today posted on Weibo that he was "very shocked" by the news of Apple's decision to cancel its EV. He added that he "knows deeply how difficult it is to make cars," but Xiaomi has made an "unshakeable strategic choice" to move into EVs. He Xiaopeng, chairman of Chinese EV maker Xpeng, expressed similar disbelief that Apple is abandoning its car plans.<br/>
<br/>
Li Xiang, CEO of Beijing-based EV maker Li Auto, remarked on Weibo that Apple's decision to shift emphasis from EVs to AI was "absolutely right." "AI will become the top-level entrance for all devices, services, applications and transactions, in which Apple should stay on top," he added.<br/>
<br/>
Chinese brands possess a rapidly growing proportion of global EV sales. Last year, China's BYD overtook Tesla as the world's top EV manufacturer.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/scmp-com/">South China Morning Post</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xiaomi/">Xiaomi</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/chinese-shocked-at-apple-car-cancelation/">Chinese Automakers Shocked at Apple&#039;s Decision to Cancel Car Project</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chinese-automakers-shocked-at-apples-decision-to-cancel-car-project.2420658/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It may take several years for the Vision Pro headset to receive major hardware upgrades, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-at-Steve-Jobs-Theater.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898794" /><br/>
"It is currently estimated that new models with significant changes to the Vision Pro specification may not be in mass production until 2027," Kuo <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/vision-pro%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0-%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E5%B8%82%E5%A0%B4%E9%9C%80%E6%B1%82%E5%B7%B2%E5%A4%A7%E5%B9%85%E6%94%BE%E7%B7%A9-%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E7%99%BC%E4%BD%88%E6%99%82%E7%A8%8B%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC-%E4%BE%9B%E6%87%89%E9%8F%88%E6%93%B4%E7%94%A2%E8%88%87%E9%80%80%E8%B2%A8%E7%8E%87%E8%A7%A3%E8%AE%80-%E6%96%B0%E6%A9%9F%E7%A8%AE%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC-%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5-vision-pro-update-us-market-demand-f12ab8423404">said today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Based on his latest supply chain checks, Kuo believes Apple has not started working on a second-generation Vision Pro, or a lower-priced version of the headset with reduced specs. However, research and development could be underway.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo does expect a modified Vision Pro to enter mass production in late 2025 to early 2026, but he said Apple is focused on improving costs and production, leading him to believe that the "user experience will not differ from the current model." It is possible these changes might not even be announced to the public, beyond a potential price cut.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo expects Apple to release the Vision Pro in additional countries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/">before WWDC in June</a>. The headset launched in the U.S. earlier this month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-vision-pro-major-upgrades-unlikely-until-2027/">Kuo: Apple Vision Pro Unlikely to Receive Major Upgrades Until 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-vision-pro-unlikely-to-receive-major-upgrades-until-2027.2420656/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/vision-pro%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0-%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E5%B8%82%E5%A0%B4%E9%9C%80%E6%B1%82%E5%B7%B2%E5%A4%A7%E5%B9%85%E6%94%BE%E7%B7%A9-%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E7%99%BC%E4%BD%88%E6%99%82%E7%A8%8B%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC-%E4%BE%9B%E6%87%89%E9%8F%88%E6%93%B4%E7%94%A2%E8%88%87%E9%80%80%E8%B2%A8%E7%8E%87%E8%A7%A3%E8%AE%80-%E6%96%B0%E6%A9%9F%E7%A8%AE%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC-%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5-vision-pro-update-us-market-demand-f12ab8423404">reiterated his belief</a> that the Apple Vision Pro will launch in additional countries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">before Apple's annual developers conference WWDC</a> in June. The headset first launched in the U.S. earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
Apple will likely expand the Vision Pro to more English-speaking countries, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.K., but it has also been localizing visionOS in preparation to launch the headset in countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said demand for the Vision Pro in the U.S. has "slowed down significantly" since the headset launched there on February 2. He estimated that U.S. shipments of the headset will total 200,000 to 250,000 units this year, which he said is better than Apple's original estimate of 150,000 to 200,000 units, but it is still a "niche market."<br/>
<br/>
In recent weeks, there was a lot of discussion about Vision Pro returns on social media. However, based on his inspection of the "repair/refurbishment production line" for the headset, Kuo estimated that the current return rate is "less than 1%."<br/>
<br/>
All in all, Kuo said the Vision Pro launch in the U.S. played out mostly in line with his expectations, beyond a "higher-than-expected number of early adopters."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/">Kuo: Apple Vision Pro on Track to Launch in More Countries Before WWDC in June</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-vision-pro-on-track-to-launch-in-more-countries-before-wwdc-in-june.2420650/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Experian and Apple today <a href="https://www.experianplc.com/newsroom/press-releases/2024/experian-consumer-credit-reports-to-now-include-apply-pay-later-loan-information">announced</a> that Apple Pay Later loan information will soon appear on Experian's credit reports. The companies said this move will provide "greater transparency" and help to protect both lenders and borrowers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Apple-Pay-Later.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893903" /><br/>
Apple Pay Later loans initiated today onward will appear on a customer's Experian credit report with a BNPL ("buy now, pay later") designation starting March 1, according to Experian. This information will have no effect on a customer's credit score right now, but Experian says it could in the future, as new credit scoring models are developed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple provided more details in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212971">support document</a> updated today:<blockquote>Apple Pay Later loans and payment history will be reported to Experian. Your credit score won't be affected when we start sharing your Apple Pay Later loan and payment history, but might be affected in the future once data is incorporated by credit scoring models, like FICO®. Information about your purchase, like the loan start date, loan amount, loan status, outstanding balance, payment dates, and payment history will be shared, which will help to build your credit history. If your purchase is canceled or fully refunded, the loan will not be reported.</blockquote>Experian is the first credit bureau that will report Apple Pay Later loans, and the information will eventually be visible to lenders performing hard inquiries.<br/>
<br/>
"By reporting Apple Pay Later loans to Experian, we aim to help promote greater transparency and responsible lending for both the borrower and the lender, while providing users with the opportunity to further build their credit," said Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, in a press release.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Pay Later <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-pay-later-launches/">launched in the U.S. last year</a>, and it allows qualifying customers to split a purchase made with Apple Pay into four equal payments over six weeks, with no interest or fees. The feature is available for eligible purchases between &#36;75 and &#36;1,000 made on an iPhone or iPad on most websites and apps that accept Apple Pay.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pay-later/">Apple Pay Later</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-pay-later-loans-on-experian-credit-reports/">Apple Pay Later Loans Will Soon Appear on Experian Credit Reports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-later-loans-will-soon-appear-on-experian-credit-reports.2420643/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hardware prototyping consultant Ken Pillonel's latest project switches the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>'s Lightning port for USB-C as part of his ongoing efforts to highlight repairability and sustainability issues in consumer electronics.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/airpods-max-usb-c-ken-pillonel.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938501" /><br/>
The project comes as a response to discontent among some users regarding the premium headphones' continued reliance on the Lightning port for charging while most other Apple devices have made the switch to USB-C, as well as rumors that the second-generation version of the device will finally make the transition. It also serves as a viable fix for damaged &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; Lightning ports, which are costly to replace.<br/>
<br/>
Pillonel created a custom replacement part to allow any technically proficient &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; users to upgrade their headphones to USB-C themselves. The endeavor involved intricate design and manufacturing processes, including the development of an open-source USB-C conversion circuit and a custom printed circuit board that fits perfectly without the need to drill or damaging any of the original components.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qnw56zHnydE?si=0qbN37UAxoEFKYJ-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<br/>
The replacement part is designed to sit atop the existing board, meticulously avoiding contact with any other components. The design also addresses potential durability concerns with a flexible section that mitigates stress on the connector, enhancing the kit's longevity.<br/>
<br/>
Pillonel explored the possibility of enabling audio pass-through via the USB-C port but ultimately decided against it due to the prohibitive cost and complexity of integrating Apple's proprietary technology. The conversion kit, along with detailed instructions, is available for purchase via <a href="https://shop.kenp.io">Pillonel's online shop</a>. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is already designing the chips that will use TSMC's next-generation 2-nanometer fabrication process, according to information allegedly sourced from an Apple employee on LinkedIn.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
Originally captured by Korean website <a href="https://gamma0burst.tistory.com/m/1107">gamma0burst</a> and shared on X (Twitter) by the leaker <a href="https://x.com/Tech_Reve/status/1762774972852998249?s=20">Revegnus</a> (@Tech_Reve), the information appears in a heavily redacted slide said to list the employee's work on past and current projects at Apple.<br/>
<br/>
A non-redacted part of the slide reads "TS5nm, TS3nm, working on TS2nm," terms believed to reference the different fabrication processes Apple has chosen for past, current, and future chips. Terms like "3nm" and "2nm" refer to the specific architecture and design rules TSMC is using for a family of chips. Decreases in node size correspond to a smaller transistor size, so more transistors can fit on a processor, leading to boosts in speed and more efficient power consumption. <br/>
<br/>
Rumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/next-gen-chip-technology-on-track-for-2025/">suggest</a> that TSMC is already starting work on more advanced 1.4-nanometer chips, which are expected to come out as soon as 2027. Apple is said to be looking to reserve TSMC's initial manufacturing capabilities for both 1.4nm and 1nm technologies. To get a sense of the nanometer scale, a strand of human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000nm wide. <br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple adopted 3nm chips for its iPhones and Macs, an upgrade over the prior 5nm mode. The switch to 3nm technology brought 20 percent faster GPU speeds, 10 percent faster CPU speed, and a 2x faster Neural Engine to the iPhone, and similar improvements on Macs.  <br/>
<br/>
Apple is believed to be the first company that will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/apple-tsmc-first-2nm-chips/">receive chips built on TSMC's future 2nm process</a>, which is expected to go into production in the second half of 2025. The 2nm fabrication process, also known simply as "N2," is expected to offer a 10 to 15 percent speed improvement at the same power or a 25 to 30 percent power reduction at the same speed compared to chips made with the supplier's ‌3nm‌ technology.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC is building two new facilities to accommodate 2nm chip production, and is waiting on approval for a third. The Taiwanese fab giant is spending billions on the change, and Apple will also need to make chip design changes to accommodate the new technology. Apple is TSMC's main client, and it is typically the first to get TSMC's new chips. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-buys-all-3nm-tsmc-chips-2023/">acquired all of TSMC's 3-nanometer chips</a> in 2023 for iPhones, iPads, and Macs, for example.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/revegnus/">Revegnus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2nm/">2nm</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-designing-2nm-silicon-chips/">Apple Likely Already Designing Chips Based on TSMC&#039;s 2nm Process</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-already-designing-chips-based-on-tsmcs-2nm-process.2420633/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An all-new "Heavy Rotation Mix" playlist today rolled out on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, providing a convenient way for users to see and listen to a personalized collection of songs that they listen to most.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-music-heavy-rotation-mix.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938650" /><br/>
The Heavy Rotation Mix features 25 songs and joins the Favorites Mix, Get Up! Mix, Chill Mix, New Music Mix, and Friends Mix. Unlike the pre-existing personalized playlists which are all updated on a weekly basis, Heavy Rotation is updated daily, allowing it to evolve as your listening habits change. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; users can listen to their own Heavy Rotation Mix and add it to their library by navigating to Listen Now, where it appears under Top Picks.<br/>
<br/>
The Heavy Rotation Mix is the latest feature to join &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; after a series of small upgrades in recent months. Earlier in February, Apple launched a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-music-launches-monthly-replay-experience/">monthly Apple Music Replay experience</a>, as well as new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/apple-music-love-heartbreak-stations/">"Love" and "Heartbreak" personalized radio stations</a>. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; also seems to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-music-testing-playlist-import-feature/">testing a service</a> to import a music library from other streaming services.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-music-heavy-rotation-mix/">Apple Music Gains Personalized &#039;Heavy Rotation Mix&#039; Playlist</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-gains-personalized-heavy-rotation-mix-playlist.2420630/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple representatives met with the U.S. Justice Department last week in a last ditch effort to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the company, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-met-with-justice-department-in-final-bid-to-avoid-antitrust-suit">Bloomberg</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
Citing people familiar with the matter, the report states that Apple and its lawyers met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who will have the final say on whether to file a suit.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2019, the Justice Department has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/23/doj-tech-company-antitrust-review/">looking into Apple's App Store business practices</a> and whether iOS favors Apple's own apps and services over those provided by third-party developers and other companies.<br/>
<br/>
The DOJ began by inquiring about Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies, and reportedly met with developers to learn more about the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;'s review process. <br/>
<br/>
The department reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/15/doj-ramping-up-apple-antitrust-probe/">escalated</a> its probe in early 2023 by assigning additional litigators to the case and requesting documents and consultations with companies connected to the investigation.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been accused of or investigated for anticompetitive practices in several other countries over the past few years, with many of the complaints related to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Most recently, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">announced</a> major changes to the way the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and apps operate in the EU in order to comply with the bloc's inbound Digital Markets Act before March 7, and the DOJ has reportedly been monitoring these developments.<br/>
<br/>
The DOJ is expected to make its first legal move in the coming weeks, likely by the end of March, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s sources, potentially leaving Apple facing an antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. government.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-met-justice-department-antitrust/">Apple Met With DOJ Antitrust Chief in Bid to Head Off Antitrust Lawsuit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-met-with-doj-antitrust-chief-in-bid-to-head-off-antitrust-lawsuit.2420623/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After more than a year since announcing the feature, Google Maps is finally rolling out glanceable directions on Android and iOS (via <em><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-is-finally-making-glanceable-directions-widely-available/">Android Police</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Google-maps-feaure.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793593" /><br/>
The feature allows users to view turn-by-turn directions and a live ETA directly from their device's lock screen – information that was previously only visible when a phone was unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
Glanceable directions also work on the app's route overview screen that appears after launching directions, before users tap the Start button. Google Maps will show directions, live ETA, and even update the route if the user takes a different path, as shown in the GIF embedded below.<br/>
<br/>
Glanceable directions are off by default, but can be enabled in the app's main settings, under Navigation. In our tests on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, the setting only appeared after switching Google accounts, suggesting the feature is still rolling out. However, we are still not seeing support for Live Activities in iOS, which was promised a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/glanceable-directions-google-maps.jpg" alt="google maps" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938633" /><br/>
Google first announced glanceable directions last <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/sustainable-immersive-maps-announcements/">February</a>, and in June said the feature was rolling out that month for walking, cycling, and driving directions on Android and iOS, including compatibility with Live Activities in iOS 16.1. <br/>

Based on assets recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/google-maps-live-activities-support-continues/">unearthed</a> by <em>MacRumors</em> in an earlier version of the app, Google Maps continues to work on integrating Live Activities support for iPhones, but when we'll actually see it at this point is anyone's guess.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/google-maps-rolls-out-glanceable-directions/">Google Maps Finally Rolls Out Glanceable Directions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-finally-rolls-out-glanceable-directions.2420618/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Confirms iOS 17.4 Lets Video Calling Apps Turn Off Reactions</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today publicly confirmed that iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 allow developers of video calling apps to turn off the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-reaction-effects-facetime/">Reactions feature</a> by default in their apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/ios-17-facetime-effects.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1070" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900390" /><br/>
As we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-api-for-turning-off-3d-gesture-effects/">reported earlier this month</a>, developers can control the default behavior of Reactions in their apps with a new API for iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, and likely macOS 14.4. The updates are expected to be released to the public in March.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-17_4-release-notes">developer notes</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-release-candidate/">iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 Release Candidates</a>:<blockquote>Developers can control the default behavior of Reactions with the key […] This is controlled per application and user choice will override application declared defaults.</blockquote>For example, video conferencing app Zoom could use Apple's new API to turn off the Reactions feature in its app by default. iPhone and iPad users who manually turn Reactions back on in Control Center would still be able to use the feature in the app. <br/>
<br/>
Reactions remain turned on by default on iOS 17.4 overall, so they still work in FaceTime and in apps that do not use the API without any further steps required.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Reactions</h2><br/>
Starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, you can make hand gestures during video calls in the FaceTime app and other video conferencing apps to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-reaction-effects-facetime/">fill the screen with 3D effects</a>. For example, you can hold two thumbs up to show fireworks on the screen, or make two peace signs with your hands to show confetti.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, many users are unaware that this new feature is turned on by default, which has led to some awkward and embarrassing moments during important video calls, such as online therapy sessions and business meetings.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fetterman released the confetti on Zoom on MSNBC <a href="https://t.co/fpylDiU1uc">pic.twitter.com/fpylDiU1uc</a></p>&mdash; Andy Kaczynski (@KFILE) <a href="https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/1761108102575710607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Instead of turning off Reactions by default altogether, Apple is allowing developers to control the feature on a per-app basis with this new API.<br/>

As found by <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser"><em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser</a>, the spring colors include Light Blue, Ocean Blue, Pink, Raspberry, Soft Mint, and Sunshine (likely a light yellow). There are also two Hermes colors, Bleu Céleste and Jaune de Naples.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on an updated version of its popular Beats Solo on-ear headphones, according to code located in the iOS 17.4 release candidate that Apple put out today. <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris found several references to the Beats Solo 4 headphones, including images. <br/>

The Beats Solo 4 look similar to the Solo 3 headphones, but have design tweaks that bring them in line with the Beats Studio Pro. Spatial Audio is supported according to the code, but we don't know what other features to expect at this time. <br/>
<br/>
There are three colors in the files, including black, pink, and blue. We can expect some of the changes that were brought to the Beats Studio Pro last year, such as improved sound quality and support for Personalized Spatial Audio. The headphones will support the same gestures as the Studio Pro, with a press on the "b" button to play/pause and answer calls, a double press to skip songs, and a long press to activate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. Apple will also likely swap the old micro-USB port for a new USB-C port to bring the headphones in line with the rest of its products. <br/>

Apple first released the Solo 3 headphones way back in 2016, and while there have been multiple color updates, nothing else has changed since then. The Solo 4 will be the first major update to the on-ear headphones in many years. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-working-on-beats-solo-4-headphones/">Apple Working on Beats Solo 4 Headphones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-beats-solo-4-headphones.2420574/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
