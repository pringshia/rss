		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working to introduce a new fourth-generation Apple silicon chip across the Mac lineup, and while the first M4 Macs are coming in 2024, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> won't get updated until 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/macbook-air-m2-13-inch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939833" /><br/>
This guide highlights everything that we know about the next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="m4_chips">M4 Chips</h2><br/>
The 13-inch and 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models were just updated with M3 chips in March 2024, so it's no surprise that they're not going to be the first devices to get the M4 chip. Apple plans to wait until 2025, so there will be about a year between the M3 and M4 chip lineups.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-AI-Optimized-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945901" /><br/>
Rumors suggest that the M4 chip will have a focus on artificial intelligence to support AI features that are coming with the next round of software updates. Most AI talk has been about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, but Apple is expected to roll out AI integrations across its platforms. The M4 chip is expected to have a Neural Engine with more cores, with the Neural Engine handling AI and machine learning tasks. The M3 chip has a 16-core Neural Engine.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple is working on M4, M4 Pro, M4 Max, and M4 Ultra chips, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models are expected to get only the standard M4 chip. There will likely be at least two variants of the M4, with the difference being the number of GPU cores. For the current &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, for example, the base M3 chip has an 8-core GPU, but there is also a 10-core GPU option. The M3 CPU is the same for all versions, and that should be the case with the M4 as well.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 will be built on Apples 3-nanometer process, much like the M3. There won't be as big of a performance improvement between M3 and M4 as there was between <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and M3 because there's no change in node size, but we can still expect modest GPU and CPU speed boosts.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
Apple overhauled the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; design in 2022, and we're not expecting the design to be tweaked with the 2025 refresh. Apple often waits several years between design changes, and there are no rumors that there will be a refreshed look.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/macbook-air-m3-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945032" /><br/>
Apple is likely to stick with the 15.3 and 13.6-inch size options, and we can expect to see the same flat, MacBook Pro-style body with Force Touch trackpad, and display with notch. As of now, it looks like the 2025 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; refresh will be focused on internal updates.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="launch_date">Launch Date</h2><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; will get an update in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/m4-ai-chips-late-2024/">the spring of 2025</a>. Spring starts on March 20, 2025, and ends on June 20, 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2025-macbook-air/">Apple&#039;s 2025 M4 MacBook Air: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-2025-m4-macbook-air-what-to-expect.2425353/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held its earnings call for the second fiscal quarter of 2024 (first calendar quarter), with Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Apple CFO Luca Maestri providing us with some details on Apple's performance, Vision Pro sales, services growth, AI plans, and other topics.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834994" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1504" /><br/>
We've highlighted the most interesting takeaways from today's earnings call.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next Week's Announcements</h2><br/>
Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said Apple is prepping for "an exciting product announcement" that the company thinks "customers will love."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Generative AI</h2><br/>
Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that Apple is making "significant investments" in AI, and that it has some "very exciting things" to share with customers "soon."<br/>
<br/>
Cook also said that he believes Apple has "advantages that will differentiate" the company, including Apple's hardware and software integration, Apple silicon with Neural Engine, and focus on privacy.<br/>
<br/>
There's a "big opportunity" for generative AI across all of Apple's devices, and Cook said he is "extremely optimistic" about future consumer demand.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Digital Markets Act</h2><br/>
Cook said that it's too early to determine the security risks and privacy implications of the changes that it has made to the app ecosystem in Europe. Apple is focused on complying while mitigating impacts to user privacy and security.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro</h2><br/>
Leading enterprise companies have been investing in Vision Pro, and Apple is seeing it used for things like aircraft engine maintenance, real-time collaboration for racing, and immersive kitchen design. Cook said that Apple "couldn't be more excited about the spatial computing opportunity in enterprise."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Services</h2><br/>
Apple's services segment set a new all-time revenue record of &#36;23.9 billion, up 14 percent from &#36;20.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts and subscriptions showing double digit growth.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscriptions, more than double the number from four years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Sales</h2><br/>
With the launch of new M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models in March, Mac revenue saw growth, reaching &#36;7.5 billion. Mac sales were at &#36;7.17 billion in the year-ago quarter, for four percent growth.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Sales</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> revenue continued to drop with no new iPads released in 2024 as of yet. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue was at &#36;5.6 billion, down 17 percent from &#36;6.7 billion a year ago. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; sales should see some improvement next quarter as Apple next week is planning to unveil new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wearables</h2><br/>
Wearables, Home and Accessories came in at &#36;7.9 billion, down 10 percent compared to last year. Last year, Apple had launched the USB-C version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, and there was a "difficult compare" this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>June Quarter</h2><br/>
Maestri said that Apple expects June quarter revenue to grow low single digits year-over-year, but Services is expected to grow double digits, as is &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/apple-q2-2024-earnings-call-takeaways/">Apple&#039;s Q2 2024 Earnings Call Takeaways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-q2-2024-earnings-call-takeaways.2425346/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[During today's earnings call covering the second fiscal quarter of 2024, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> again spoke about Apple's work on generative AI. He said that Apple has "advantages" that will "differentiate" the company in the era of AI, and some "very exciting things" will be shared with customers in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947754" /><br/>
<blockquote>We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI. We are making significant investments and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon.<br/>
<br/>
We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry leading neural engines, and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create.</blockquote><br/>
Rumors have suggested that Apple's first AI features are designed to run on-device rather than contacting a cloud service, which would make Apple's AI much more private and secure than an online AI option. Apple's plan to have generative AI available on-device will require significant CPU and GPU power, and Apple is planning to focus on AI with the upcoming M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
We could see the M4 chip as soon as next week in new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, with <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">indicating last weekend</a> that there is a chance Apple will unveil the chip in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/tim-cook-on-generative-ai/">Tim Cook on Generative AI: &#039;We Have Advantages That Will Differentiate Us&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-on-generative-ai-we-have-advantages-that-will-differentiate-us.2425341/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/">announced</a> financial results for the second fiscal quarter of 2024, which corresponds to the first calendar quarter of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/aapl-2q24-line.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="772" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949054" /><br/>
For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of &#36;90.8 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;23.6 billion, or &#36;1.53 per diluted share, compared to revenue of &#36;94.8 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;24.1 billion, or &#36;1.52 per diluted share, in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/04/apple-2q-2023-earnings/">year-ago quarter</a>. Apple set an all-time quarterly record for Services revenue at &#36;23.9 billion, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> revenue dropped by over &#36;5 billion compared to the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Gross margin for the quarter was 46.6 percent, compared to 44.3 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple's board of directors also authorized an additional &#36;110 billion for share repurchases and declared an increased dividend payment of &#36;0.25 per share, up from &#36;0.24 per share. The dividend is payable May 16 to shareholders of record as of May 13.<blockquote>"Today Apple is reporting revenue of &#36;90.8 billion for the March quarter, including an all-time revenue record in Services," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "During the quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro and to show the world the potential that spatial computing unlocks. We're also looking forward to an exciting product announcement next week and an incredible Worldwide Developers Conference next month. As always, we are focused on providing the very best products and services for our customers, and doing so while living up to the core values that drive us."</blockquote>As has been the case for over four years now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current quarter ending in June.<br/>

Apple will <a href="http://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">provide live streaming</a> of its fiscal Q2 2024 financial results conference call at 2:00 pm Pacific, and <em>MacRumors</em> will update this story with coverage of the conference call highlights.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Conference call recap ahead...</b><br/>
<!--more--><br/>
<b>1:40 pm</b>: After closing up over 2% in regular trading today, Apple's share price is up another 6% in after-hours trading following the earnings release.<br/>
<br/>
<b>1:43 pm</b>: Services and Mac were Apple's only segments that saw year-over-year growth, with Services increasing by almost &#36;3 billion and Mac increasing by around &#36;300 million. But with &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; dropping by over &#36;5 billion, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> dropping by &#36;1.1 billion, and Wearables dropping by &#36;800 million, Apple's overall revenue declined by roughly &#36;4 billion. Increased gross margin meant, however, that Apple's net income declined by only around &#36;500 million, and with Apple's share count continuing to decline as it buys back shares, earnings per share actually increased by a penny year-over-year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:01 pm</b>: The call is beginning with the usual caveats about forward-looking statements. On the call is Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and CFO Luca Maestri.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:02 pm</b>: Tim is on the call, reporting revenue of &#36;90.9 billion and an earnings per share record of &#36;1.53 for the March quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:03 pm</b>: He is touting revenue records in a number of countries and regions, including March quarter records in Latin America, the Middle East, Canada, India, Spain and Turkey.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:03 pm</b>: He notes that in the year-ago quarter, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; demand was increased because of supply disruptions and a refill of channel inventory — "We estimate this one time impact added close to &#36;5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year. If we remove this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:04 pm</b>: Now talking up <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, revealing that half of Fortune 100 companies have bought &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; units and are exploring ways to use them for business. "An exciting product announcement" next week "that we think our customers will love."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:05 pm</b>: Mentions WWDC in June, and says: "We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI. we are making significant investments and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines, and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:06 pm</b>: Now going over &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue, &#36;46 billion, down 10% year over year, but notes growth in mainland China and that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and 15 Pro Max were the best-selling smartphones in Urban China.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:06 pm</b>: Reveals that he visited China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore and that customers and communities have a great affinity for Apple and it's one of the many reasons he is so optimistic about the future.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:07 pm</b>: Moving to Mac, revenue &#36;7.5 billion, up 4% year over year. Launched the new 13- and 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with M3.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:07 pm</b>: &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, &#36;5.6 billion, down 17% year over year following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and 10th-gen &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; last fiscal year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:08 pm</b>: Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was &#36;7.9 billion, down 10% thanks to a difficult compare on Apple Watch and AirPods. He notes that Apple is harnessing AI and machine learning to power fall detection and heart rhythm notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:09 pm</b>: Services appear to the the most successful category in the quarter, at &#36;23.9 billion, up 14% year over year with all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments.<br/>

<br/>
Products was &#36;66.9 billion, down 10% year over year, thanks to a challenging compare on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, partially offset by Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:14 pm</b>: Gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings, favorable mix to service, partially offset by leverage.

<br/>
<b>2:19 pm</b>: KLM is using &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; to train aircraft engine mechanics and Lowes is using it for immersive kitchen design.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:20 pm</b>: Apple revenue was roughly flat in the first half of the fiscal year, in spite of having one less week of sales and FX headwinds. There were first-half revenue records in Latin America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey. First half diluted EPS record of &#36;3.71/share was up 9% from last year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:21 pm</b>: Ended quarter with &#36;162 billion in cash and marketable securities. &#36;105 billion in debt, with &#36;58 billion in net cash. &#36;27 billion returned to shareholders, with &#36;3.7 billion in dividends and &#36;23.5 billion through open market repurchases of 130 million shares. &#36;110 billion for share repurchases was approved by the board, plus an increase of the dividend by 4% to &#36;0.25/share.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:22 pm</b>: Expects June revenue to grow low single digits year over year, despite 2.5% of FX headwinds. Services to grow low double digits, similar to what was reported in the first half of the year. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to grow double digits. Gross margin between 45.5 and 46.5. OpEx of &#36;14.3 to &#36;14.5 billion. Tax rate to be around 16%.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:22 pm</b>: Q&A with analysts is beginning.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:24 pm</b>: Q: Re the June quarter guidance, revenue outlook for low single digit growth, can you go through product assumptions, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, what gives you confidence around that? What was better than expected in Services?<br/>
<br/>
A: We expect to grow low single digits for the company, and expect services to grow double digits at a rate similar to the first half of the fiscal year. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; should grow double digits. This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter.<br/>
<br/>
In services, we see a very strong performance across the board, records in several categories and geographic segments. It's very broad-based. Subscription business is going well. Transacting and paid accounts are growing double digits. Seeing strong performance in both developed and emerging markets.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:26 pm</b>: Q: Should we expect changes to historical capex cadence with changes to AI, changes to how we've thought about the split between tooling, data centers and facilities?<br/>
<br/>
A: We are excited about the opportunity, pushing hard on innovation on every front and we've been doing that for many years. We've spent more than &#36;100 billion on R&D in the last five years. On CapEx, we have a hybrid model where we make some investments ourselves and share some with suppliers and partners, we purchase some of the tools and manufacturing equipment, and some of our suppliers buy things. Same with data centers. It's a model that has worked for us historically and we plan to continue on the same lines going forward.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:27 pm</b>: Q: What are the changes and implications to Apple from the EU third-party app stores, can hurt user experience but also result in lower revenue for Apple. What are developers and consumers doing?<br/>
<br/>
A: It's too early to answer the question, just implemented in March in the EU. We're focused on complying while mitigating the impacts to user privacy and security. That's our focus.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:28 pm</b>: Q: On product gross margin, you noted mix and leverage... are people mixing down across product lines? Trying to get some color on customer behavior.<br/>
<br/>
A: On a sequential basis, we were down, it's primarily the fact that we had a slightly different mix of products than the previous one. Leverage plays a big role as we move from the holiday quarter into a more typical quarter. Primarily leverage and a different mix of products. We haven't seen anything particuluar.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:29 pm</b>: Q: Mentioned excitement around GenAI a couple of times. There have been a few different ways to monetize and historically Apple hasn't made a lot of revenue from software upgrade cycles, any color you can share on that?<br/>
<br/>
A: Don't want to get in front of our announcements. We see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products, and we believe we have advantages that set us apart and we'll be talking more about it as we go through the weeks ahead.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:31 pm</b>: Q: A broad concern about headwinds at rising commodity costs having a hit on your gross margins. Thinking of all commodities that go into products collectively, are they rising or falling and what tools do you have to mitigate?<br/>
<br/>
A: During the last quarter, commodity and component costs behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up. They've gone up slightly during the March quarter. It's been a period, not only during this quarter but the last several that commodities have behaved well to us. They go in cycles, so always that possiblity — we are starting from a very high level of gross margin — 46.6% is something we haven't seen in decades, starting from a good point. We try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us, so we will try to mitigate if there are headwinds but particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: Any more color from your visit to China, I know you continue to be confident there in the long term, but any color as to when the tide turns?<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at our results in Q2, for Greater China we were down 8%, an acceleration from Q1. The primary driver was &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and if you look at &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; within mainland China, we grew on a reported basis, before any kind of normalization for supply disruptions. If you look at the top-selling smartphones, the top two in urban China were iPhones. While I was there, it was a great visit and we opened a new store in Shanghai, and the reception was very warm and highly energetic. I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there. I maintain a great view of China in the long term, I don't know how each quarter and week goes, but over the long haul I have a very positive viewpoint.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:34 pm</b>: Q: There's a fear out there that you may lose some traffic acquisition revenue, and I'm wondering if you thought AI, from a big picture, on a long term basis, is AI an opportunity for you to continue to monetize mobile real estate from a big picture. Is there a big picture color you can give and how to monetize that?<br/>
<br/>
A: I think AI, generative AI and AI, both are big opportunities for us across our products. We'll talk more about it in the coming weeks, but I think there are numerous ways there that are great for us. We think that we're well positioned.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:36 pm</b>: Q: Last quarter you spoke about getting traction in enterprise, is your AI going to be both consumer and enterprise?<br/>
<br/>
A: Our focus on enterprise has been, through the quarter and the quarters that preceded it, have been on selling iPhones and iPads and Macs and recently added Vision Pro to that. We're thrilled with what we see there in terms of interest and big companies buying some to explore ways they can use it. I see enormous opportunity in enterprise. I wouldn't want to cabin that to AI only. I think there's a great opportunity for us around the world in enterprise.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:37 pm</b>: Q: Seen a bias towards Pro model, seen growth in Services but weakness in product?<br/>
<br/>
A: Customers want to purchase the best product we offer in each category, we've done what we can to make it easier for customers through financing and other programs. Customers want to buy at the top of the range, but in developing markets where affordability issues are more pronounced, we have seen a trend where this is more sustainable.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:39 pm</b>: Q: On Capital Allocation, &#36;58 billion of net cash, as you get closer to net cash neutral, would you ever take leverage on the balance sheet or once you get to neutral, how do you feel about leverage or returning free cash to shareholders?<br/>
<br/>
A: I would say one step at a time. We put out the target to get to net cash neutral, we've worked hard to get there, our cash flow generation has been very strong. We've increased our allocation to the buyback, let's get there first, it's going to take a while still. We'll reassess what the optimal capital structure for the company when we get there.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:41 pm</b>: Q: On China discussion, could you step back, these numbers are still declining on a year over year basis. What are you seeing from a macro basis in China, do you think this is macro or micro driven over there?<br/>
<br/>
A: I can only tell you what we're seeing, I don't want to present myself as an economist so I'll steer clear of that. What we saw was an acceleration from Q1 and it was driven by &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in Mainland China before we adjust for this &#36;5 billion impact did grow. Other products didn't fare as well, so we clearly have work to do there. I think it has been and is through last quarter the most competitive market in the world. I wouldn't say anything other than that, I've said that before, I think it was last quarter as well.<br/>
<br/>
If you step back from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class, we've tried to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers and you can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there. I continue to feel very optimistic.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:44 pm</b>: Q: How are you thinking of the competitive landscape outside of China, what's the consumer demand and receptivity to new devices? Is this an AI thing or are there other drivers?<br/>
<br/>
A: There's a big opportunity with generative AI across all our devices, that's not within the next quarter and we don't guide at the product level, but I'm extremely optimistic. That's kind of how I view it. If you step back on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and you make this adjustment from the previous year, our Q2 results would be flat-ish on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. That's how we performed in Q2.<br/>
<br/>
On outlook, I'll repeat what we said before, the color for the quarter, we expect to grow in total, expect services to grow, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to grow, for the rest I'll let you make assumptions and then we'll report 3 months from now.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:46 pm</b>: Q: Services growth accelerated, what parts of services did you see that, and why isn't it more sustainable as you're guiding a little lower?<br/>
<br/>
A: Number of things on services, first of all, the overall performance was very strong. As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets, so Services do well across the world. Records in many of our services categories, there are some growing very fast because they're relatively small in the scheme of services, Cloud, Video, Payments. Those set all-time revenue records. We feel very good about the progress that we're making in services. As we go forward, if you look at our growth rates at year ago, they improved during the course of our fiscal year last year. The comps become more challenging as we go through the year but we expect to grow double digits in the June quarter at a rate that's similar for the first half.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:48 pm</b>: Q: For this India market, how much of the momentum you're seeing would you associate with retail expansion strategy versus supply chain or manufacturing changes and strategies?<br/>
<br/>
A: We did grow strong double-digits so we were very pleased about it, it was a new March revenue record for us. As I said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it's a major focus for us. In terms of the operational side, we are producing there. From a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive. Yes, the two things are linked from that point of view, but we have both operational things going on and we have go-to-market initiatives going on. We opened a couple stores last year and we see enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels and also working on developer ecosystem as well. We've been very pleased that there's a rapidly growing base of developers there and so we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing. I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:49 pm</b>: Q: At a high level, when we look at the data points reported through the quarter, what are people missing in Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; traction in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; market, given data points from the last quarter?<br/>
<br/>
A: I can't address the data points, I can only address what our results are. We did accelerate last quarter and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; grew in mainland China so that's what the results were. I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:50 pm</b>: Q: How would you characterize channel inventory dynamics for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;?<br/>
<br/>
A: We decreased inventory during the quarter, which we usually do during Q2 so that's not unusual. We're very comfortable with overall channel inventory.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:52 pm</b>: Q: Is Apple approaching a point where all emerging markets might become bigger than current Greater China segment?<br/>
<br/>
A: I think you're asking a really interesting question. We were looking at something similar recently. Obviously China is by far the largest emerging market we have, but when we start looking at India, Saudi, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia, the numbers are getting large. We're very happy because these are markets where our market share is low, the populations are large and growing, and our products are really making a lot of progress in those markets. The level of excitement for the brand was very high. It's very good for us and certainly the numbers are getting larger all the time, the gap to China is reducing and hopefully that trajectory continues for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:54 pm</b>: Q: Do you see ways to deploy capital more to spur replacement demand either with greater device financing, more investment in marketing, more promotions, do you need to produce those sorts of margins or more important to spur growth with replacements?<br/>
<br/>
A: Innovation spurs the upgrade cycle. There's economic factors as well that play in there but what kind of offerings from our carrier partners and so forth, but we work all of those. We price our products for the value that we're delivering. That's how we look at it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things, at the long arc of time that maybe isn't fully understood, we've gone through a long period of very strong dollar and what that means, given that our company sells 60% of revenue outside the US, the demand for our products in the US is stronger than the results that we report just because of the translation of local currency into dollars. That is something to keep in mind as you look at our results. Innovation, obviously, financing solutions, trade in programs, and we will continue to make all those investments.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:56 pm</b>: Q: For enterprise, what are some of the top two or three cases for Vision Pro, what are you hearing about?<br/>
<br/>
A: I wouldn't say one emerges at the top right now, the most impressive is the way people use the Mac is the way they use it for everything. People are using it for everything, field service, training, healthcare things like preparing a doctor for surgery or advanced imaging. Command and control centers, it's an enormous number of different verticals and our focus is on growing that ecosystem and getting more apps and more enterprises engaged. The event that we had recently, can't overstate the enthusiasm in the room. It was extraordinary. We're off to a good start with enterprise.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:57 pm</b>: Q: March quarter, commodity pricing was favorable, for memory and such for June and the full year?<br/>
<br/>
A: We just provide guidance for the current quarter. We are guiding to a very high level of gross margin, 45.5-46.5, within that guidance we expect memory to be a slight headwind (not a very large one), and the same applies for foreign exchange. Negative impact sequentially of about 30 basis points.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following this past weekend's sighting of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/">NBA superstar LeBron James carrying an unreleased Beats speaker</a> reminiscent of the former Beats Pill, F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo has also been seen <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6eY884oXAH/">teasing the unreleased speaker</a> at this week's Grand Prix stop in Miami.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/beats-pill-f1-daniel-ricciardo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949043" /><br/>
Details on the unreleased speaker remain unknown, but it features a similar pill-shaped design to the rest of the Pill family and includes a lanyard that has not been present on previous models. The most recent model in the Pill family was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/beats-pill-discontinued/">discontinued in 2022</a>, and this new one will likely include a USB-C port, updated Bluetooth specs, and other improvements.<br/>
<br/>
Beats has yet to officially announce the upcoming Beats Pill, so a release date similarly remains unknown.<br/>
<br/>
The Beats Pill teases come as part of a busy week for Apple's speaker and headphone brand, as Beats this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-4-launch/">introduced the Solo 4 on-ear headphones</a> and announced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">all-new Solo Buds earphones</a> that will be launching in June.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[At some point in the last 24 hours, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> seems to have forgotten how to relay the time. When asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; "what time is it?" &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is unable to answer and directs users to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-and-Mini-feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-882635" /><br/>
"I found some web results, I can show them if you ask again from your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;," is &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s full response to the time question. If you ask what time it is in a specific location, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is able to respond, and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac provides the time as usual when asked.<br/>
<br/>
This is a bug that Apple will be able to fix server side, so it will likely be addressed quickly. In the meantime, to get the time from &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; without having to swap to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, include your location.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has long been ridiculed for failing to understand requests and not providing the expected information, and small bugs like this are a bit embarrassing as Apple prepares for a major AI update.<br/>
<br/>
For the last several months, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has also been struggling with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> commands, and there have been many complaints from smart home users. Asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to "turn off the lights in the living room," for example, often results in the lights being turned on or turned off in another room entirely. Hopefully some of these issues will be solved with a &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; overhaul in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and its sister updates.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> Apple seems to have fixed the issue somewhat. Asking "what time is it?" provides the time, but &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is still not able to give the time if you ask "what's the time?" or "can you tell me the time?"<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today confirmed that it will be bringing all of the app ecosystem changes made to iOS in the European Union to iPadOS in the fall. Earlier this week, the European Commission said that iPadOS is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/eu-says-ipados-digital-gatekeeper-dma/">also a gatekeeper platform</a> under the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/ipad-pro-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940265" /><br/>
EU developers will be able to distribute <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> using alternative app marketplaces or websites, and all of the same terms will apply. The Core Technology Fee will be charged for apps that are distributed outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and have more than one million first annual installs, though there are exceptions for small developers, which Apple also announced today.<br/>
<br/>
With iPadOS being added to the mix, Apple has also confirmed that users who install the same app on both iOS and iPadOS in a 12-month period will only generate one first annual install for that app rather than two, which should help developers keep below the CTF threshold.<br/>

As with the changes to iOS, the upcoming changes to iPadOS only apply to developers who distribute apps in the European Union and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; users in the EU. For the rest of the world, there are no changes and apps will continue to be available only from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/ipados-eu-app-changes-fall/">Apple Confirms iPadOS Will Get Same EU App Changes as iOS This Fall</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-ipados-will-get-same-eu-app-changes-as-ios-this-fall.2425320/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that it is tweaking the terms of the 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee (CTF) that apps distributed using the new EU business terms must pay, introducing a solution that would keep small apps that go viral from being charged unreasonable fees. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
First, independent and small developers who earn no revenue at all will not have to pay the CTF. Students, hobbyists, and freeware app developers who distribute free apps and earn no money will not be charged the fee. Developers will need to declare their non-commercial status on an annual basis, and to maintain this status, developers must have no revenue in or out of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for their app product.<br/>
<br/>
Second, to address fears of the CTF causing outrageous fees for an app that suddenly goes viral, Apple has implemented a three year on-ramping process for small developers. The three year period begins when a developer agrees to the new &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; business terms, and during this time, if an app goes viral and exceeds the one million annual install threshold that triggers the CTF, the CTF won't be charged if the developer earns less than 10 million euros in global business revenue, and the fee is reduced after that.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Under 10 million euros: No CTF during the three year period.</li><br/>
 	<li>Between 10 million and 50 million euros: CTF must be paid, but it is capped at one million euros per year for the three year period.</li><br/>
 	<li>Beyond 50 million euros: Benefit is no longer available, and the full CTF has to be paid.</li><br/>
<li>After three years: Developers will pay for each first annual install after the initial one million first annual installs per year.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Note that this ramp up period is only available to small developers who have not previously exceeded one million first annual installs, and it is calculated based on global business revenue rather than just &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; revenue. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says that 99 percent of developers will not be subject to the CTF to begin with, but the new ramp up period will go further to make sure that small developers who get a breakout hit will have time to scale their businesses before having to pay fees.<br/>
<br/>
Back in March, developer Riley Testut spoke with Apple officials at a workshop on the Digital Markets Act, and he asked what would happen if a young developer had an app go viral and unwittingly racked up millions in fees. Testut asked the question because when he was a high school student, he released GBA4iOS outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. It was unexpectedly downloaded more than 10 million times, and that would have bankrupted him had he been subject to the Core Technology Fee.<br/>
<br/>
In response, Apple VP of regulatory law Kyle Andeers said that Apple was working on a solution because the company is not trying to stifle innovation. Apple believes that a free app going viral and being subject to exorbitant fees will be a rare occurrence, but the changes will keep that from happening. The CTF update will also be a welcome change for those who want to release entirely free apps outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The CTF is only applicable to apps that have opted in to the new &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; business terms in the European Union. Apps in the EU are now able to be distributed through alternative app stores and developer websites without having to rely on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models were its most purchased smartphones in the U.S. in the first quarter of this year, according to the latest <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/iphone-15-winners-and-losers">Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) report</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/iPhone-14-vs-iPhone-15-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-863031" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max accounted for 22% and 23% of all iPhones sold in Q1 2024, for a 45% combined share. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Plus took a 9% share of all iPhones sold, while the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> were the third most popular, each taking 14% of the share. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max share hardly changed compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and Pro Max the same quarter a year ago. However, Apple saw sales of the base model &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; decline relative to a year ago. The overall mix of &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models was lower, accounting for 68% of all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales. <br/>
<br/>
By contrast, in Q1 2023 the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; series had a 7% higher share of all iPhones sold, taking 75% combined. The percentages suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus were more popular than the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus over the equivalent quarter the previous year. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CIRP-iphone-14-15-quarters-compared.jpg" alt="" width="1127" height="827" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948990" /><br/>
Noting the change, CIRP comments:<br/>
<blockquote>We see this as a continuation of a trend from the past couple of quarters, as the lower- priced current models give up some share to older models. The once flagship, now base iPhone 15, is no longer the leading-edge choice, as the Pro and Pro Max models take that role.</blockquote>Last week, CIRP released a report indicating that new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; activations are down to a low not seen in the U.S. smartphone market <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/25/iphone-activation-market-share-decline/">for the last six years</a>. <br/>
<br/>
CIRP said that Apple's installed smartphone base was higher than recorded activations, but Apple's share of new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; activations fell from 40% to 33% over the past year, suggesting a shift away from the higher market shares Apple enjoyed in previous years.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/">CIRP</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/cirp-iphone-15-vs-14-sales-q1/">iPhone 15 and 15 Plus Proving Less Popular With Buyers This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-and-15-plus-proving-less-popular-with-buyers-this-year.2425315/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When Apple released iOS 17.3 in January, it introduced a Stolen Device Protection feature to provide iPhone users with added security. This article explains what it does, why you might want to turn it on, and how to go about doing so.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926120" /><br/>
In 2023, reports began emerging about a new method thieves were using to steal iPhones and access users' highly sensitive data. Thieves would surreptitiously spy on their victims in public while they entered their passcode, before going on to steal the device. With the passcode known to them, criminals could empty bank accounts, steal passwords, and make the iPhone untraceable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Enter, Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
To make it harder for a thief to access passcode-protected data on a stolen iPhone, Apple in iOS 17.3 included Stolen Device Protection. With the feature enabled, Face ID or Touch ID is required to access passwords in iCloud Keychain, Lost Mode settings, options for erasing the device, and making purchases in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the new biometric requirements, the feature also imposes a one-hour security delay on actions like changing an Apple ID password. In other words, if someone tries to change Apple ID login information, Face ID authentication is required, and then an hour must pass before the password can be changed. The only time this wait period is not imposed is when the device at a trusted location like home or work.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Actions Requiring Face ID/Touch ID With Stolen Device Protection Enabled</h2><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>Viewing/using passwords or passkeys saved in iCloud Keychain</li><br/>
 <li>Applying for a new Apple Card</li><br/>
 <li>Viewing an Apple Card virtual card</li><br/>
 <li>Turning off Lost Mode</li><br/>
 <li>Erasing all content and settings</li><br/>
 <li>Taking certain Apple Cash and Savings actions in Wallet</li><br/>
 <li>Using payment methods saved in Safari</li><br/>
 <li>Using your iPhone to set up a new device</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Note that these actions do not have a passcode backup, so you can't use a passcode to avoid using Face ID or Touch ID. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Actions Requiring 1-Hour Delay With Stolen Device Protection Enabled</h2><br/>
Actions that require biometric authentication and have a one-hour security delay include the following:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Changing your Apple ID password</li><br/>
 <li>Updating select Apple ID account security settings, including adding or removing a trusted device, trusted phone number, Recovery Key, or Recovery Contact</li><br/>
 <li>Changing your iPhone passcode</li><br/>
 <li>Adding or removing Face ID or Touch ID</li><br/>
 <li>Turning off Find My</li><br/>
 <li>Turning off Stolen Device Protection</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>How to Enable Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
Note that Stolen Device Protection is only available on iPhones that are able to run iOS 17, which includes the iPhone XS and newer. Also, make sure your iPhone is up-to-date and running iOS 17.3 or later (Settings ➝ General ➝ Software Update). Here's how to enable the feature.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Face ID & Passcode</strong> (or <strong>Touch ID & Passcode</strong>, depending on iPhone model).</li><br/>
<li>Enter your passcode at the prompt.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Stolen Device Protection</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle on the switch next to <strong>Stolen Device Protection</strong>, then tap <strong>Turn On</strong> at the prompt.</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/stolen-device-protection-iphone.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938365" /><br/>
<br/>
Note that if your iPhone is running iOS 17.4 or later, an additional option on this screen lets you choose to require a security delay when your device is <strong>Away from Familiar Locations</strong>, or <strong>Always</strong>. Otherwise, that's all there is to it. You can just as easily turn off the feature by toggling off the <strong>Stolen Device Protection</strong> switch, but you'll need to authenticate to do so.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/">Apple Security</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-stolen-device-protection/">How to Enable Stolen Device Protection on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-enable-stolen-device-protection-on-iphone.2425308/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AI safety and research company Anthropic has <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/team-plan-and-ios">announced</a> the launch of its Claude iOS app, offering users easier access to the conversational agent from their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/claude-ios-app.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948971" /><br/>
Similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, the Claude chatbot operates by processing large amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like responses. Its architecture is based on machine learning techniques including large language models (LLMs). <br/>
<br/>
Whereas ChatGPT is foremost designed for versatility and scalability, Anthropic says its focus is on creating a "steerable" AI so that users can direct the model's style and content more effectively, thereby mitigating potential harmful outputs and biases from the outset.<br/>
<br/>
The AI company says its Claude iOS app features:<br/>
<blockquote><ul><li>Seamless syncing with web chats: Pick up where you left off across devices.</li><br/>
<li>Vision capabilities: Use photos from your library, take new photos, or upload files so you can have real-time image analysis, contextual understanding, and mobile-centric use cases on the go.</li><br/>
<li>Open access: Users across all plans, including Pro and Team, can download the app free of charge.</li></ul></blockquote>According to Anthropic, early testers report that the Claude app is exceptional for brainstorming ideas on the go, getting quick answers to questions, or analyzing scenes and images from the real world. <br/>
<br/>
In March, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family">announced</a> that its Claude 3 language model surpassed ChatGPT and Google's Gemini in various critical industry benchmarks. According to the company, Claude 3 excelled in areas including graduate-level reasoning and multilingual math and coding, among other metrics. <br/>
<br/>
Anthropic also highlighted that their most advanced version of Claude 3, named Opus, demonstrated capabilities close to human level, particularly in delivering quick responses, making it well-suited for complex and urgent tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Claude for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> is a free download available from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/claude/id6473753684">Direct Link</a>] Users can get 5x more Claude usage than its free plan allows and access Anthropic's most powerful model (Claude 3 Opus) by upgrading to a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude">paid Pro plan</a>, which is &#36;20 per month.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/claude-ai-iphone-app-launch-anthropic/">Anthropic Announces Claude AI Chatbot App for iPhone and iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anthropic-announces-claude-ai-chatbot-app-for-iphone-and-ipad.2425307/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's atrial fibrillation (AFib) history feature on Apple Watch has been <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFDA/bulletins/399d551">qualified</a> by the FDA under its Medical Device Development Tools (MDDT) program, the first digital health technology feature of its kind to do so.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/watchos-9-afib-history.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-849842" /><br/>
Since 2022, Apple Watch has supported AFib History, which allows users diagnosed with atrial fibrillation to view an estimate of how frequently their heart is in this type of irregular rhythm. <br/>
<br/>
The feature analyzes pulse rate data collected by a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor to identify episodes consistent with AFib and provides the user with a retrospective estimate of AFib burden (a measure of the amount of time spent in AFib during past Apple Watch wear). Apple says the feature is intended for individuals aged 22 years or older who have been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.<br/>
<br/>
The AFib History feature received FDA clearance in the United States just prior to its announcement by Apple, after being validated in a clinical study. The MDDT program under which the feature was <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/178230/download?attachment">approved</a> today is the FDA's method of qualifying tools that medical device sponsors can choose to use in the development and evaluation of medical devices.  <br/>
<br/>
According to the FDA, the Atrial Fibrillation History feature is:<br/>
<ul><li>The first digital health technology qualified under the MDDT program, providing a non-invasive way to check estimates of atrial fibrillation (AFib) burden within clinical studies.</li><br/>
<li>Designed to be used as a biomarker test to help evaluate estimates of AFib burden as a secondary effectiveness endpoint within clinical studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of cardiac ablation devices to treat.</li><br/>
<li>Designed to be used throughout the clinical study, both before and after cardiac ablation devices, to monitor a study participant’s weekly estimate of AFib burden.</li></ul><em>(Via <a href="https://www.myhealthyapple.com/fda-qualifies-afib-history-mddt/">MyHealthyApple.com</a>.)</em><div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fda/">FDA</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/apple-watch-afib-history-evaluate-medical-devices/">Apple Watch AFib History Feature Qualified by FDA to Evaluate Medical Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-afib-history-feature-qualified-by-fda-to-evaluate-medical-devices.2425302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google paid Apple &#36;20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine for Safari on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/google-s-payments-to-apple-reached-20-billion-in-2022-cue-says">Bloomberg</a></em>. The information was revealed in court documents Google provided in its antitrust dispute with the United States Department of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916340" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/safari-google-search.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" /><br/>
The DoJ has accused Google of having a monopoly on search, and in the lawsuit against Google, the search engine deal with Apple has been a major focus. In November, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-google-safari-search-revenue/">lawsuit documents indicated</a> that Google was paying 36 percent of the total revenue that it earns from searches conducted on Safari, and now it turns out that equates to &#36;20 billion.<br/>
<br/>
Google has been the default search engine on Apple devices since 2002, though the deal has been renegotiated several times. Apple and Google have worked to keep the terms of the search engine agreement under wraps during the trial and before, but it has been well known that Google is paying Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/google-pays-apple-billions-default-search/">billions per year</a>.<br/>

Last October, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that the agreement between Apple and Google has made it impossible for search engines like Bing to compete. Microsoft at one point wanted Apple to buy Bing, but Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/">was not interested</a>. Microsoft blamed Google, but Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> said that Apple was concerned that Bing could not compete in "quality and capabilities." Cue claimed that Apple uses Google as the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s default search engine because Apple has "always thought it was the best."<br/>
<br/>
Google is the default search engine on Apple devices in most countries, but users can opt to swap to Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Ecosia as alternatives. Changing browser engines requires opening up the Safari settings.<br/>
<br/>
In Europe, the Digital Markets Act has required Apple to make changes to how browsers work. Users are able to choose a default browser when setting up their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and there are more options than the handful of providers that Apple allows in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
If Google loses the antitrust lawsuit against it, the deal between Apple and Google could be dissolved. Closing arguments are expected on Thursday and Friday, with the judge's ruling set to come later in 2024.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/">Safari</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/google-default-search-engine-safari-20-billion/">Google Paid Apple &#36;20 Billion in 2022 to Be Default Safari Search Engine</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-paid-apple-20-billion-in-2022-to-be-default-safari-search-engine.2425289/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the 10th anniversary of the Apple Watch approaching, we thought it would be fun to take a look back at an interesting bit of Apple Watch history.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ipad-demo-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1337" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948938" /><br/>
After the Apple Watch was announced in 2014, and before it became available in 2015, Apple sent out custom Apple Watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> demo kiosks to retail stores. The Apple Watch and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; units used for these devices were specially designed, had custom software, and represent the first and only time that an Apple Watch was able to pair with an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT">AppleDemoYT</a>, known for sourcing rare prototypes, shared images and detailed information about the demo units with <em>MacRumors</em>, offering up detailed insight on the lengths Apple went to for this custom experience. AppleDemoYT was able to acquire one of these now-rare demo units.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ipad-demo-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948939" /><br/>
Jony Ive and his design team came up with the Apple Watch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Kiosks as a way for customers to try out an Apple Watch without needing help from an employee. Apple used a modified <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> 2 running iOS 8.2 paired with an original Apple Watch running watchOS 1.0, with the two devices fused in a custom housing.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Apple used had multiple components removed, including the camera, microphone, and speakers, and the housing of the setup served as the body of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The Apple Watch was heavily modified as well, featuring a groove along the diagnostic port for cable routing, holes to affix it to the demo unit, and a special Sport Band that was shorter than normal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ipad-demo-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948940" /><br/>
The Apple Watch was paired to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; using a wired connection. A lightning cable attached to the Apple Watch diagnostic port connected to a converter board inside the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, allowing the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to communicate with and charge the Apple Watch. A special app called Apple Watch Demo was used to allow the Apple Watch to interface with the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and a connection to Apple's server was required.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ipad-demo-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948941" /><br/>
The server that Apple used for the Apple Watch Demo app has long since gone offline, so the only way to see how the setup worked is through a demo unit that was paired in 2014 and not reset since then. With a functional unit, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is able to mirror the Apple Watch, offering up transition animations and providing tips on the actions that can be performed on the Apple Watch. This functionality is demoed in AppleDemoYT's video:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Apple Watch Demo (2014) - Interactive Demonstration - The Forgotten Apple Device - Apple Demo" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vidGNxCuIA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The custom &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; was not only the sole model able to connect with an Apple Watch, it was also the only &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that could be charged using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> 2, originally designed for the Mac. A &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; connector charged the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, Apple Watch, and extra batteries inside the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. A Lightning port is available as well, but Apple's documentation suggests that it is only meant to be used for data transfer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple discontinued the demo unit in 2016 because it was riddled with issues. Updates to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or Apple Watch would erase demo content, and the front glass was prone to cracking because of the design of the housing. Batteries degraded quickly due to the always-on charging, and overheating and failure were continual problems. Apple also had to deal with pairing and syncing issues, and that caused Apple to tweak the interactive part of the demo functionality in 2015. After that change, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; provided Apple Watch info, but no longer mirrored the content on the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ipad-demo-5.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948942" /><br/>
Demo units that were decommissioned were supposed to be destroyed, and so finding one that is still available, functional, and in good working condition is unusual. The Apple Watch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; kiosk represents one of the most advanced custom devices that Apple had designed at the time, and it offers a neat look back at the Apple Watch's debut.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple has plans for the 10th anniversary of the Apple Watch, and as soon as this year, we may see a redesigned "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">Apple Watch X</a>" with an updated magnetic band attachment system, new health features, and more.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/apple-watch-ipad-demo-unit/">Check Out This Apple Watch iPad Demo Unit From 2014</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/check-out-this-apple-watch-ipad-demo-unit-from-2014.2425283/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 18, the Calendar app on the iPhone will feature integration with the Reminders app, according to information obtained <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/01/apples-ios-18-to-streamline-task-management-with-unified-events-and-reminders">by <em>AppleInsider</em></a>.<br/>

The report claims that iPhone users will be able to schedule and organize reminders directly within the Calendars app, without needing to open the Reminders app. Reminders are expected to be visible within the Day, Week, and Month calendar views.<br/>
<br/>
The change will extend to the Mac with macOS 15, the report says.<br/>
<br/>
The same publication recently reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/ios-18-notes-app-voice-memos-math-rumors/">Calculator and Notes app will also be integrated</a> on iOS 18, and said that the update will include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">new Safari features such as "Intelligent Search" and "Web Eraser."</a> We recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-18-rumor-recap-for-apps/">recapped iOS 18 rumors on a per-app basis</a>, with new features also expected for Apple Music, Messages, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models have been expected to feature the M3 chip for over a year, recent reports have unexpectedly suggested that the new devices will instead feature the as-yet-unannounced M4 chip. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUBArI37GvI" title="New iPad Pro with M4 LEAKED! AI-Focused iPad Coming Next Week?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Last week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that he now believes there is a "strong possibility" that the upcoming &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">equipped with Apple's next-generation M4 chip</a>, rather than the M3 chip that debuted in the MacBook Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> six months ago. He said a key new feature of the M4 chip will be an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">upgraded Neural Engine</a> that boosts performance for AI tasks, and he believes Apple will market the next &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; as an AI-powered device.<br/>
<br/>
Introducing the M4 chip in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and only six months after the previous chip generation would be unprecedented moves. Yet this is not the first time that the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models have been rumored to feature the M4 chip. In March, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/chip-details-of-16-upcoming-apple-devices-revealed/">chip details of 16 new Apple devices</a> were revealed by a source with a proven track record of sharing accurate information about Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>
The disclosed technical information contained four identifiers for an unreleased chip that relates to the upcoming 11- and 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models display sizes. This sequence of identifiers suggested that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will contain the M4 chip, rather than the M3. With Gurman now supporting this possibility and the potential of an AI focus, it seems like an increasingly likely eventuality.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple does introduce the M4 chip in the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, its Apple silicon roadmap would appear to be moving faster than expected. It is possible that TSMC's N3E production volume remains low, making it more suitable for a device like the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; rather than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or Mac at this point in time. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models at its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">"Let Loose" event on May 7</a>.

The Apple Watch SE lacks some of the upgraded features you'll find in some Series 9 or Ultra 2 models, like temperature sensing and ECG functionality, but it will otherwise provide you with all key Apple Watch features, and at the cheapest price possible.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[LG has updated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> app to support Dolby Atmos, making it the first smart TV manufacturer to do so (via <em><a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1714539123">FlatpanelsHD</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/apple-music-lg-tv.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-826014" /><br/>
The change allows users to experience immersive audio that enhances the spatial perception of sound, previously achievable only with external hardware. The feature was confirmed to be operational on the LG GX OLED TV from the 2020 lineup, with expectations that it will work on all LG TVs that are compatible with Dolby Atmos from 2020 onwards.<br/>
<br/>
While the TV's built-in speakers can utilize this new capability, LG suggests that the best audio experience is achieved with a compatible surround sound system, which can take advantage of the Dolby Atmos technology more effectively.<br/>
<br/>
The update to the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app on LG TVs circumvents the necessity for additional Apple hardware. Before this update, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s Dolby Atmos support was available on TVs singularly through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K, paired with either Apple's HomePods or Sonos speakers connected through the Sonos app. Other smart TV manufacturers are likely to follow suit and add support for Dolby Atmos in their own &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; apps. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg/">LG</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dolby-atmos/">Dolby Atmos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/lg-tv-support-for-apple-music-dolby-atmos/">LG TVs Gain Support for Dolby Atmos With Apple Music</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lg-tvs-gain-support-for-dolby-atmos-with-apple-music.2425255/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
