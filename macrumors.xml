		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/">shared a behind-the-scenes look</a> at the video production of its recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">"Scary Fast" M3 MacBook Pro event</a>, which was shot entirely on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max and edited on Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3dbG9pAi8I?si=x-T5g9jOpAsQEse4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Titled "Behind the Scenes: An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/">Apple Event</a>" and running two minutes and 16 seconds, the YouTube video reveals some of the additional professional equipment used to film the event, including cranes, dollies, gimabals, and drones. <br/>
<br/>
Interview clips with the directors, producers, and editors explain how the capabilities of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; allowed them to work effectively with low light conditions, which is traditionally a bit more challenging for a standard video camera. <br/>
<br/>
The production was advised by Apple’s Jon Carr, a Pro Workflow video specialist whose credits include <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> and <em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em>, and Jeff Wozniak, who has worked on productions including <em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>Iron Man 2</em>.<br/>
<br/>
The video specialists also espouse the benefits of being able to shoot directly to external storage and use Apple Log to access more dynamic range in post production.<br/>
<br/>
The ‌‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>‌ Pro‌ and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max models feature an improved camera system, including a main camera with a larger sensor, a new coating to reduce lens flare, optical image stabilization, and better low light performance for Portraits and Night mode.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shot-on-iphone/">Shot on iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/apple-video-scary-fast-event-shot-iphone-15-pro/">Apple Video Reveals How &#039;Scary Fast&#039; Event Was Shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-video-reveals-how-scary-fast-event-was-shot-on-iphone-15-pro-max.2409406/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Chrome users on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> can now opt to move the Chrome address bar to the bottom of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display, mirroring a design change that Apple implemented in Safari last year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/chrome-address-bar-ios.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919879" /><br/>
Chrome for iOS can be customized to have the URL bar at the top or the bottom of the interface depending on where the user prefers it to be. Google says this is a feature that Chrome users have been requesting for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
To move the Chrome address bar, long press on it and then choose the "Move address bar to the bottom" option. Users can also navigate to the Settings menu and choose "address bar" to change the bar's position.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome-for-ios/">Chrome for iOS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/chrome-ios-address-bar-reposition/">Google Chrome for iOS Now Lets You Move URL Bar to Bottom of iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-chrome-for-ios-now-lets-you-move-url-bar-to-bottom-of-iphone.2409404/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro has been discontinued in the wake of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">announcement</a> of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro. Because of this, we're tracking a few last-chance deals on the previous generation computer that should be enticing for anyone who wants to purchase the last MacBook Pro to get a Touch Bar before they're gone forever.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/macbook-pro-school.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905459" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

<br/>
<a href="https://howl.me/ckUgVjtNXAE">Best Buy</a> has the 256GB 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro for &#36;1,049.00, down from &#36;1,299.00.

<br/>
You'll find the same &#36;250 discount on the 512GB 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro at Best Buy. This model is on sale for &#36;1,249.00 in both colors, down from &#36;1,499.00. Amazon is not matching this sale.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[At its "Scary Fast" event, Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">new 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac models</a> with M3 series chips. It was a very quick and tidy 30-minute event, with no other products or surprises revealed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Event-October-2023.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919098" /><br/>
Below, we have listed some rumored products that were not announced at the event.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Magic Accessories With USB-C</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-Magic-Keyboard-and-Mouse.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919840" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that Apple's event would likely include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">updated versions of the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad</a> for the Mac with USB-C ports for charging, but the accessories are still equipped with Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPads</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPad-mini-6-orange-BG.jpg" alt="" width="1881" height="1058" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816576" /><br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Gurman both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">ruled out new iPads</a> for the rest of 2023, and this event indeed lacked any iPad announcements.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> had discovered that an Apple supplier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/apple-scary-fast-event-battery-filings/">resubmitted</a> a sixth-generation iPad mini battery filing in a Chinese regulatory database last week, but this ultimately did not relate to a seventh-generation iPad mini at the event.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said Apple does not plan to introduce new iPads <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-march-2024-launch/">until March 2024 or later</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iMac Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
While the Intel-based iMac Pro was discontinued in 2021, there have been rumors about an eventual Apple silicon replacement ever since.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Gurman said Apple still has plans to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">larger pro version of the iMac with a 32-inch display</a> in either late 2024 or in 2025. It's unclear which chips this Mac would be equipped with. On a speculative basis, it could use the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips announced yesterday, or perhaps even an upcoming M3 Ultra chip, but Apple might be on to the M4 series of chips by time the new iMac Pro is announced.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the new iMac Pro will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">feature mini-LED backlighting</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Air and Mac Mini</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898577" /><br/>
To be clear, new MacBook Air and Mac mini models were not expected to be announced at this event, but they are worth mentioning given that they will likely use the same M3 or M3 Pro chips that were announced yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman expects updated 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the standard M3 chip to be released <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect">in the first half of 2024</a>. He also said Apple is already working on a new Mac mini, but he did not provide a launch timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPower</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/09/airpower.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="448" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-587742" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C are available for the all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a> today on Amazon, down from &#36;249.00. This is a match of the previous low price that we tracked during Prime Day earlier in the month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895407" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Amazon is the only retailer offering this record low price as of writing, and there's an estimated delivery window of November 2 through November 5 for most places in the United States. The deal has been automatically applied, so you won't need to clip any coupon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset. Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
We're seeing a lot of AirPods-related deals on Amazon as we head into November, including the AirPods 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;99.00</strong></a> (&#36;30 off), AirPods 3 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;149.99</strong></a> (&#36;19 off), AirPods Pro 2 (Lightning) for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a> (&#36;60 off), and the AirPods Max for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZDSP2Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;479.99</strong></a> (&#36;69 off).<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Just over seven years after it was introduced, the Touch Bar has now been fully discontinued on all new MacBooks sold by Apple, marking the end of an era for a hardware feature that was loved by some users and derided by others.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Touch-Bar-13-Inch-MacBook-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1364" height="769" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853221" /><br/>
The first MacBook Pro models with the Touch Bar were released in October 2016, as part of a controversial redesign that also included a defective butterfly keyboard and the removal of many ports, including an SD card slot, HDMI, and MagSafe. Physical function and Esc keys were also removed in favor of the Touch Bar.<br/>
<br/>
Apple initially <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/10/apple-unveils-groundbreaking-new-macbook-pro/">described</a> the Touch Bar as a "revolutionary" and "breakthrough" interface, but it was clearly not popular enough to stick around.<br/>
<br/>
It was a slow death for the Touch Bar:<ul><li>In 2019, Apple released the first 16-inch MacBook Pro with a physical Esc key, but the Touch Bar lived on in place of physical function keys.</li><br/>
<li>In 2021, Apple removed the Touch Bar from higher-end MacBook Pro models, switching back to full-size physical function keys.</li><br/>
<li>This week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro</a>, the final model with a Touch Bar.</li></ul>For now, the Touch Bar can still be found on some <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/13-inch-macbook-pro">refurbished models</a> sold by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible that the Touch Bar could return at some point in the future, especially if the 13-inch MacBook Pro is ever re-released as a lower-cost model, but at this point there is no firm evidence to suggest this will happen.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-bar/">Touch Bar</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/">Touch Bar Fully Discontinued on New MacBooks After Seven Years</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/touch-bar-fully-discontinued-on-new-macbooks-after-seven-years.2409371/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/m3-macbook-pro-and-imac-orders-available/">M3 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> features two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, not three Thunderbolt 4 ports like the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by M3 Pro and M3 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-m3pro-max-ports.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919715" /><br/>
Apart from having fewer USB-C ports, the lack of Thunderbolt 4 support on the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the base M3 chip means it only supports one display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz, or one display with up to 4K resolution at 120Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
In comparison, like the M2 Pro chip it replaces, the M3 Pro supports up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt. The M3 Pro-powered MacBook Pro models also support one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the M3 Max supports up to four external displays in the following configuration: Up to three external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI. <br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, M3 Max MacBook Pro models can support up to three external displays by connecting two displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz, or one display with 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, both the M3 Pro and M3 Max also support native DisplayPort over USB-C, and one display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are available to order now, and they will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest M3 Pro chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> has 25% less memory bandwidth than the M1 Pro and M2 Pro chips used in equivalent models from the two previous generations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-pro-chip.jpg" alt="" width="5104" height="2868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919649" /><br/>
Based on the latest 3-nanometer technology and featuring all-new GPU architecture, the M3 series of chips is said to represent the fastest and most power-efficient evolution of Apple silicon thus far. For example, the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro chip is up to 40% faster than the 16-inch model with M1 Pro, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
However, looking at Apple's own hardware specifications, the M3 Pro system on a chip (SoC) features 150GB/s memory bandwidth, compared to 200GB/s on the earlier M1 Pro and M2 Pro. As for the M3 Max, Apple says it is capable of "up to 400GB/s." This wording is because the less pricey scaled-down M3 Max with 14-core CPU and 30-core GPU has only 300GB/s of memory bandwidth, whereas the equivalent scaled-down M2 Max with 12-core CPU and 30-core GPU featured 400GB/s bandwidth, just like its more powerful 12‑core CPU, 38‑core GPU version.  <br/>
<br/>
Notably, Apple has also changed the core ratios of the higher-tier M3 Pro chip compared to its direct predecessor. The M3 Pro with 12-core CPU has 6 performance cores (versus 8 performance cores on the 12-core M2 Pro) and 6 efficiency cores (versus 4 efficiency cores on the 12-core M2 Pro), while the GPU has 18 cores (versus 19 on the equivalent M2 Pro chip). <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, while the M3 chip's 16-core Neural Engine has the same number of cores as the one Apple featured in the 3nm-based A17 Pro chip that debuted in the iPhone 15 Pro series in September, it's comparatively weaker on paper in terms of maximum achievable throughput, which is measured in trillions of operations per second (TOPS). <br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, the M3 Neural Engine is capable of 18 TOPS, whereas the A17 Pro Neural Engine is capable of 35 TOPS. It's hard to say for certain, but it is possible that the iPhone 15 Pro requires a higher performing Neural Engine for features like computational photography and Face ID, whereas the M3 can compensate in other areas like machine learning by utilizing its additional GPU cores.<br/>
<br/>
Taken together, it's presently unclear what real-world difference these changes make to M3 performance when pitted against Apple's equivalent precursor chips in various usage scenarios, especially given that the latest processors include new Dynamic Caching memory allocation technology which ensures that only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-pro-soc.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1903" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919672" /><br/>
This opaqueness is not helped by the fact that Apple advertises the power of the new M3 Pro and M3 Max chips by repeatedly emphasizing comparisons to the M1 Pro and M1 Max, rather than the more recent M2 variants, against which performance gains appear more modest. Hopefully we will learn more in time when the first thoroughgoing third-party benchmarks become available.<br/>

Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/">tech specs</a> for the laptops indicate that all of the latest 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models provide up to 600 nits of peak brightness for SDR content, which is a 20% increase over the 500 nits maximum on the previous models. For HDR content, all of the models can achieve peak brightness of up to 1,600 nits, which is unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
"The Liquid Retina XDR display is the world's best laptop display, with an exceptional 1000 nits sustained and 1600 nits of peak brightness for HDR content, impressive contrast ratio, vivid colors, and an outstanding viewing angle," said Apple. "SDR content is now displayed at up to 600 nits, which is 20 percent brighter than before."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's top-of-the-line 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro costs &#36;7,200 when you opt for all upgrades. Pricing used to top out at &#36;6,499, but with support for 128GB Unified Memory, maximum memory now costs &#36;1,000.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919526" /><br/>
The highest-end 16-inch MacBook Pro has a base cost of &#36;4,000 with 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 48GB Unified memory, and 1TB SSD. Fully upgrading the memory costs &#36;1,000, while opting for an 8TB SSD adds another &#36;2,200. The 14-inch MacBook Pro can be purchased with the same upgraded specs for &#36;6,899.<br/>
<br/>
128GB Unified Memory is only available with the M3 Max chip. The M3 chip is limited to 24GB Unified Memory like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, while the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro supports up to 36GB Unified Memory.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> has been updated with the new M3 chip that offers notable speed improvements over the prior <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>, but as it has not been refreshed since 2021, there are also a few other new features. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-M3-Blue-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917291" /><br/>
The machine's design has not been updated, and it comes in the same colors, but the more advanced M3 chip allows the 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; to be outfitted with up to 24GB Unified Memory, up from the 16GB maximum in the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; version.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also added Wi-Fi 6E support to allow the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; to connect to 6GHz networks, and it supports the Bluetooth 5.3 protocol for improved connectivity and range. <br/>
<br/>
The M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; still comes in two-port and four-port varieties with the latter featuring an extra two USB 3 ports. The two-port model has an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, while the four-port model has an 8-core GPU and 10-core GPU. The version with more ports also supports up to 2TB of storage, while the two-port model is limited to 1TB.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,299 for the two Thunderbolt port model, while the model with two Thunderbolt ports and two USB 3 ports is priced starting at &#36;1,499.

		<description><![CDATA[The new MacBook Pro models that Apple announced today feature Apple's latest 3-nanometer M3 chips, with the new technology bringing a notable improvement in battery life. The new models offer the "longest battery life ever in a Mac," according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>

The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip now lasts for up to 22 hours when watching movies with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app, or up to 15 hours when browsing the web. This model has a 70-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery.<br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips last for up to 18 hours when watching moves with the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app or up to 12 hours when browsing the web. The M3 Pro and M3 Max 14-inch models come with a slightly larger 72.4-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro or M3 Max chips are able to last for up to 22 hours when using the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app to watch movies, or 15 hours when browsing the web. The M3 Pro and M3 Max 16-inch models are equipped with a 100-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery.<br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro models can fast charge with a 96W USB-C power adapter (the M3 Pro and Max models ship with one while the M3 model ships with a 70W adapter), and the 16-inch MacBook Pro models can fast charge with the included 140W USB-C power adapter.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/m3-macbook-pro-models-battery-life/">Apple&#039;s New MacBooks With M3 Chips Offer Up to 22 Hours of Battery Life</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-macbooks-with-m3-chips-offer-up-to-22-hours-of-battery-life.2409263/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Accordingly, Apple has released its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUVQ3AM/A/usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-2-m-space-black">USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable in Space Black</a> for &#36;49.<br/>
<br/>

Apple already includes a color-matched MagSafe 3 charging cable in the box with the new MacBook Pro models, but the cable can be ordered individually from Apple's online store for those who want an extra one or need a replacement. The cable also remains available in Space Gray, Midnight, Starlight, and Silver.<br/>
<br/>
The cable is also compatible with 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M2 chip.<br/>
<br/>
MagSafe technology allows the cable to magnetically attach to a MacBook. If someone trips on the cable, it releases so that the MacBook does not go tumbling. The cable is two meters long and features a woven design for added durability.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-space-black/">Apple&#039;s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable Now Available to Order in Space Black</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-now-available-to-order-in-space-black.2409262/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-imac-whats-in-the-box.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919481" /><br/>
In recent months, Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">widely expected</a> to be planning to switch the Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse to USB-C upon the release of the M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, but that has not occurred. These peripherals continue to feature a Lightning port and are completely unchanged following Apple's series of Mac-related announcements. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to leave the accessories unchanged is notable because the company has otherwise progressively been moving to USB-C. The entire <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, all latest-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Remote for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, and new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> all now feature a USB-C port. Other than the three peripherals that accompany the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, the only latest-generation Apple devices that still have a Lightning port are the AirPods, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lightning/">Lightning</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-mouse/">Magic Mouse</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/">Magic Keyboard</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-trackpad/">Magic Trackpad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/magic-accessories-still-feature-lightning/">Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse Still Feature Lightning Instead of USB-C</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magic-keyboard-magic-trackpad-and-magic-mouse-still-feature-lightning-instead-of-usb-c.2409261/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of the new M3 14-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is no longer listed for sale through Apple's store, with the MacBook Pro section offering only 14-inch and 16-inch models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/13-inch-macbook-pro-2022-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1100" height="619" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850662" /><br/>
The 13-inch MacBook Pro was the last Mac with a Touch Bar, so the sunsetting of the 13-inch MacBook Pro also means that the Touch Bar has been officially discontinued.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> MacBook Pro was priced at &#36;1,299, making it &#36;100 more expensive than the very similar 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the new M3 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,599, which means the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is the only option for those looking for a more affordable notebook at the current time.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch MacBook Pro will still be available from Apple's refurbished store and from retailers until supplies run out.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/">MacBook Pro 13"</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13">13" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">Apple Discontinues 13-Inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro-with-touch-bar.2409256/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-supercharges-24-inch-imac-with-new-m3-chip/">announced</a> an updated version of the 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> featuring the all-new M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="902" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919460" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with M3 is up to 2x faster than the previous &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, which featured the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. For those upgrading from an Intel based &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, Apple says that the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is up to 2.5x faster than previous 27-inch models and 4.5x faster than previous 21.5-inch models.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; now supports up to 24GB of memory and the M3 chip's all-new GPU brings hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing to the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
The new machine also features Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. It continues to be available in the same green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and silver color options as the previous model, but it comes with new color-matched wallpapers.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; starts at the same &#36;1,299 price of the previous model.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple at its "Scary Fast" October event has announced a new dark aluminum <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">Space Black</a> color for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">M3 Pro and M3 Max chips</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
Apple calls the new MacBook Pro in Space Black, "a gorgeous dark aluminum finish, with a breakthrough anodization method that resists fingerprints." The enclosure is created from a custom alloy that uses 100% recycled aluminum and is described as "very durable."<br/>
<br/>
M3 Pro and M3 Max models are also available in Silver, while the 14‑inch MacBook Pro with M3 is available in Silver and Space Gray – but not Space Black.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-new-macbook-pro-featuring-m3-chips/">announced</a> next-generation 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro personal computers during its "Scary Fast" event. These new computers include the new M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, which were also announced during the event.<br/>
<br/>

Every model of the new lineup features a Liquid Retina XDR display with 20 percent brighter SDR content, a built-in 1080p camera, and a six speaker sound system. The new MacBook Pros offer up to 22 hours of battery life as well. The display also features 1,000 nits sustained and 1,600 nits of peak brightness for HDR content.<br/>
<br/>
The standard M3 chip has up to an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, the M3 Pro chip has up to a 12-core CPU and up to a 18-core GPU, and the M3 Max chip has up to a 16-core CPU and up to a 40-core GPU. The M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips support up to 24GB, 36GB, and 128GB of unified memory, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro is up to 60 percent faster than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1. For users with more demanding workflows, the 14-inch and 16-inch M3 Pro MacBook Pro is up to 40 percent faster than the 16-inch model with M1 Pro.<br/>
<br/>

For ultimate performance, the 14-inch and 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro models offer up to 2.5x faster speeds than the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max, and up to 11x faster speeds than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips are built using 3-nanometer technology and offer a faster, more efficient next-generation GPU. They feature "Dynamic Caching" technology, meaning the GPU allocates the use of local memory in hardware in real time, ensuring only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the internal upgrades, there's also a new color in the MacBook Pro lineup: Space Black. Only M3 Pro and M3 Max versions of the computer are available in Space Black. Apple says the finish greatly reduces fingerprints thanks to an anodization seal. M3 Pro and M3 Max models also come in Silver, and the 14-inch M3 model comes in Silver and Space Gray.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are available to order today, and they will launch on Tuesday, November 7. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,599 (&#36;1,499 for education); the 14-inch M3 Pro MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,999 (&#36;1,849 for education); and the 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;2,499 (&#36;2,299 for education).<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">Apple Announces New 14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Models With M3 Series Chips</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-new-14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-with-m3-series-chips.2409248/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
