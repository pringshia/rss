		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced a new beta firmware update for the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, AirPods 2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A307, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2/">prior 6A300 firmware</a> released in September. The updates are limited to developers at the current time. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not often provide details or notes on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ or ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.3 beta that Apple released today once again includes support for collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists, allowing &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscribers to build playlists with friends, family members, and others who share their musical tastes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="5484" height="3085" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918890" /><br/>
Apple initially announced collaborative playlist features when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> was released, but the option did not come out at launch. Apple then tested it in iOS 17.2, but ended up pulling the collaborative functionality <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-beta-4-features/">in the fourth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, when you create a new playlist or select an existing playlist, there's a little person-shaped icon that can be tapped to enable collaboration. Choosing this option provides a link where anyone can contribute a song.<br/>
<br/>
Those who want to try it out in iOS 17.3 can click on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/pl.u-kaJH7JG97e?a=join&amp;it=zr6IZVEGZ6tVoblq">the MacRumors playlist link</a> to try adding a song.<br/>
<br/>
The person who started the collaboration can opt to approve those who ask to add songs, but this is not enabled by default. Anyone with the link to a playlist can add music, though the owner can turn off collaboration at any time or remove people.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said earlier this week that collaborative &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; playlists would launch in 2024, which is the right timing for when we expect iOS 17.3 to launch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-beta-apple-music-collaborative-playlists/">iOS 17.3 Beta Adds Collaborative Apple Music Playlists Again</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-adds-collaborative-apple-music-playlists-again.2413531/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the updates available a day after the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-releases-ios-17-2-and-ipados-17-2/">iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3 introduces a Stolen Device Protection feature that limits access to your private information in case someone obtains both your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and your passcode. When activated, it requires <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> identity verification to do things like accessing passwords in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain, turning off Lost Mode, making purchases through Safari with saved payment credentials, and more.<br/>
<br/>
There are also features that require verification <em>and</em> have a one-hour delay to access, such as changing an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; passcode, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; passcode, turning off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and turning off &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;. More details can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">found in our article on Stolen Device Protection</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We are also still waiting on a handful of new features that Apple promised would be coming in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-delays-airplay-in-hotel-rooms/">AirPlay on Hotel Room TVs</a>. Apple recently said that both of these features will be coming in 2024, so we could see them in this beta as iOS 17.3 is expected to launch sometime in January 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also working on app sideloading in the European Union, a next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> feature, and the adoption of<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/"> rich communication services (RCS)</a>, but these may be features that instead come in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-3-and-ipados-17-3-to-developers.2413527/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first iOS 17.3 beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-beta-1-to-developers/">rolling out to developers today</a> includes a new "Stolen Device Protection" feature that is designed to add an additional layer of security in the event someone has stolen your iPhone and also obtained the device's passcode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926120" /><br/>
Earlier this year, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern and Nicole Nguyen reported about instances of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/19/apple-responds-to-iphone-theft-recovery-key-report/">thieves spying on a victim's iPhone passcode before stealing the device</a>, often in public places like bars. The thief can then reset the victim's Apple ID password, turn off Find My, view passwords stored in iCloud Keychain for banking and email accounts, and more. All in all, the report said thieves can essentially "steal your entire digital life."<br/>
<br/>
When Stolen Device Protection is turned on, Face ID or Touch ID authentication is required for additional actions, including viewing passwords or passkeys stored in iCloud Keychain, applying for a new Apple Card, turning off Lost Mode, erasing all content and settings, using payment methods saved in Safari, and more. This extra step ensures that a thief cannot perform these actions with the iPhone's passcode alone.<br/>
<br/>
For especially sensitive actions, including changing the password of the Apple ID account associated with the iPhone, the feature adds a security delay on top of biometric authentication. In these cases, the user must authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, wait one hour, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again. However, Apple said there will be no delay when the iPhone is in familiar locations, such as at home or work.<br/>
<br/>
The opt-in feature can be found in the Settings app under Face ID & Passcode → Stolen Device Protection. iPhone users who update to the iOS 17.3 beta will be prompted with the option to test a preview of the feature following installation, but Apple said this screen will not be shown to users who install the public version of iOS 17.3 coming later.<br/>
<br/>
Actions that will require Face ID or Touch ID authentication when the feature is turned on:<ul><li>Viewing/using passwords or passkeys saved in iCloud Keychain</li><br/>
<li>Applying for a new Apple Card</li><br/>
<li>Viewing an Apple Card virtual card</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Lost Mode</li><br/>
<li>Erasing all content and settings</li><br/>
<li>Taking certain Apple Cash and Savings actions in Wallet</li><br/>
<li>Using payment methods saved in Safari</li><br/>
<li>Using your iPhone to set up a new device</li></ul>Actions that will require Face ID or Touch ID authentication and have a one-hour security delay when the feature is turned on:<ul><li>Changing your Apple ID password</li><br/>
<li>Updating select Apple ID account security settings, including adding or removing a trusted device, trusted phone number, Recovery Key, or Recovery Contact</li><br/>
<li>Changing your iPhone passcode</li><br/>
<li>Adding or removing Face ID or Touch ID</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Find My</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Stolen Device Protection</li></ul>Apple said it plans to share additional documentation about Stolen Device Protection over time to clarify how the feature works. The option will be available on all iPhone models that are compatible with iOS 17, including the iPhone XS and newer. iOS 17.3 will likely be released to the public in January or February.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">iOS 17.3 Beta Adds New Stolen Device Protection Feature to iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-adds-new-stolen-device-protection-feature-to-iphone.2413526/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the seventh beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that runs on the Vision Pro headset. The sixth beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-releases-visionos-beta-6/">came out in November</a>, so it has been a month since Apple last released a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people do not have access to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta, and it is not entirely clear what Apple is adding in each &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is letting developers attend Vision Pro labs around the world, and developers who visit these locations are able to test the Vision Pro in person and get help from Apple engineers on their &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is not expected until early 2024, so Apple still has time to refine the hardware and software.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-releases-seventh-beta-of-visionos/">Apple Releases Seventh Beta of visionOS</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-seventh-beta-of-visionos.2413520/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.geekbench.com">Geekbench</a> developer Primate Labs has announced a new 0.6 preview version of Geekbench ML that expands beyond iOS and Android to offer benchmarking capabilities for AI and other machine learning workflows on desktop platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/geekbench-ml-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926100" /><br/>
<blockquote>AI and ML-related workflows aren’t just confined to mobile, and hardware architecture on desktop and laptop devices is changing to accommodate this shift in computing. With this latest 0.6 preview, Geekbench ML now supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. This means you’ll be able to see how machine learning-powered tasks run on your desktop, laptop, or even a server — whether it has new AI-specific hardware or not. And, as always, our models and data sets are identical across all supported platforms, making scores comparable.</blockquote>With new and improved frameworks, Geekbench ML supports faster performance on the latest hardware using more up-to-date models including for Core ML on iOS and macOS.<br/>
<br/>
New workloads for Geekbench ML include Depth Estimation to reflect capabilities related to software-assisted portrait mode photo effects, Style Transfer to measure the ability to transform one image into the style of another one, and Image Super-Resolution to assess AI-driven image upscaling.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/geekbench-ml-mac.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1041" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926101" /><br/>
Geekbench ML 0.6 is still a preview release that Primate Labs will continue to tweak based on results and feedback, so scores from version 0.6 can't be directly compared to those from the previous 0.5 release. Primate Labs is looking toward a polished 1.0 release at some point in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench ML is available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geekbench-ml/id1563487010">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.primatelabs.banff">Google Play Store</a>, and Primate Labs is directly hosting preview versions for <a href="https://cdn.geekbench.com/GeekbenchML-0.6.0-Mac.zip">macOS</a>, <a href="https://cdn.geekbench.com/GeekbenchML-0.6.0-WindowsSetup.exe">Windows</a>, and <a href="https://cdn.geekbench.com/GeekbenchML-0.6.0-Linux.tar.gz">Linux</a> on its website.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/geekbench-ml-macos/">Geekbench Machine-Learning Benchmark Tools Add Support for macOS and Other Desktop Platforms</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/geekbench-machine-learning-benchmark-tools-add-support-for-macos-and-other-desktop-platforms.2413518/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[TSMC has already demonstrated prototype 2nm chips to Apple ahead of their expected introduction in 2025, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9be182f-ec9e-4426-9cd2-d5181fd64778"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>

Apple is said to be closely aligned with TSMC in the race to develop and implement 2nm chip technology, which will surpass their current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> chips and associated nodes in terms of transistor density, performance, and efficiency. 2nm chips are expected to be integral in underpinning future Apple silicon chips, as well as next-generation data center and artificial intelligence technology. Test results for TSMC's "N2" 2nm prototype chips have already been showcased to Apple and several other key TSMC clients as plans for upcoming chips begin to solidify.<br/>
<br/>
In a separate report, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231211PD229.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a> points out that Apple is a key player in TSMC's battle against Samsung and Intel to bring 2nm chips to market, with no sign of the close relationship between the two companies waning. Apple reportedly has no plans to reduce its &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; or 2nm chip orders from TSMC before 2027 at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was the first company to utilize TSMC's &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; technology with the A17 Pro chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, and the company is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker's N2 chips. TSMC's production of 2nm chips is slated to begin in 2025, with their first appearance in Apple devices likely to follow soon after.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ft-com/">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology/">TSMC Demos Next-Gen Chip Technology to Apple Ahead of 2025 Debut</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology-to-apple-ahead-of-2025-debut.2413498/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple introduced its long-awaited Journal app for iPhone in iOS 17.2. Here is everything you need to know about using Journal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Journal-App-iOS-17-Feature-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2612" height="1469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918878" /><br/>
Apple in June 2023 announced it was bringing its own journaling app to iOS 17, and it is finally here as part of Apple's December software update, iOS 17.2. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's Journal app lets you record your daily thoughts and activities, incorporating data like photos, music listened to, workouts, and more, plus it suggests topics to write about.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Creating Your First Journal Entry</h2><br/>
The Journal app has a simple, straightforward interface. When you open it up, you're presented with a "+" button, and tapping on it lets you start a new entry. When you have added a few entries, the button at the top-right lets you filter them based on photos and activities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/create-first-journal-entry.jpg" alt="" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925892" /><br/>
The writing interface includes several buttons along the top of the keyboard that you can use to access the aforementioned "moments," as well as add photos, take pictures, add voice recordings, and add location tags, respectively. Before you can use them, you will be prompted to allow the app to access your pictures, camera, microphone, and location. Journal entries are automatically dated, and you can bookmark your favorite ones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/journal-suggestions.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922984" /><br/>
By default, the Journal app will suggest recent and recommended "moments" from your week that include photos, workouts, or places you visited, and you can use these as writing prompts or you can tap New Entry and start writing. (To write new entries without viewing suggestions first toggle on the switch in Settings ➝ Journal ➝ Skip Journaling Suggestions.)<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Using Journaling Reflections</h2><br/>
If you have a serious case of writer's block, the Journal app can offer you entry prompts in the form of "reflections." When starting a new entry, these reflections appear in between your recommended and recent "moments," are designed to inspire and guide you, providing ideas and topics to explore in each entry.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/journal-prompts.jpg" alt="journal" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922986" /><br/>
The reflections can vary from thought-provoking questions to creative writing cues, and if the one you're offered doesn't get your gears turning, you can generate a new one by tapping the two arrows that form a circle.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Setting a Journaling Schedule</h2><br/>
Staying consistent with journaling can be difficult, but your iPhone can make it a lot easier with the new Journal app's scheduling feature. Here's how to set it up.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap Journal.</li><br/>
<li>Tap Journaling Schedule, then toggle on the switch next to Schedule.</li><br/>
<li>Choose the days of the week that you want to be reminded to write, and select a time of day to receive the prompt.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/journal-schedule.jpg" alt="journal" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922941" /><br/>
<br/>
The scheduling option isn't just a reminder – it's about building a habit. So whether it's a gentle reminder notification that you need in the morning or a prompt before bed, you can adapt the feature to your personal routine.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Lock Your Journal</h2><br/>
Privacy and security are paramount when it comes to personal journaling. That's why Apple's Journal app introduces enhanced security features, including encryption and password protection, to safeguard your journal from unauthorized access.<br/>
<br/>
To lock your journal using your device's passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID, follow these steps.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap Journal.</li><br/>
<li>Tap Lock Journal and enter your passcode when prompted.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle on the switch next to Lock.</li><br/>
<li>Tap Require Passcode, then select from the options: Immediately, After 1 minute, After 5 minutes, After 15 minutes.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/lock-journal.jpg" alt="" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923156" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. Your journal is now inaccessible without entering your device passcode, or using Face ID or Touch ID, providing you with peace of mind every time you record sensitive or personal information.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-apple-journal-app/">iOS 17.2: How to Use Apple&#039;s New Journal App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-how-to-use-apples-new-journal-app.2413478/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has reportedly offered to open up the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> near-field communication (NFC) system that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> uses to other payment services, in a possible effort to forestall impending EU regulatory action.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-pay-feature-dynamic-island.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921515" /><br/>
In a brief report Tuesday, <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-offers-settle-eu-antitrust-charges-apple-pay-sources-say-2023-12-12/">Reuters</a></em> said that Apple has offered to let rivals access the NFC system in iPhones, but it is not yet clear what Apple's proposal involves. Banks have complained that Apple's exclusive access to the NFC contactless chip in its devices privileges &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; over other payment systems.<br/>
<br/>
In May 2022, the EU antitrust watchdog <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/02/eu-apple-pay-nfc-objection/">officially objected</a> to Apple restricting rivals' access to its mobile tap-and-go technology, making it difficult for competitors to develop alternative mobile wallet services on Apple devices. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; competitor PayPal and other rivals <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/03/paypal-eu-antitrust-complaint-apple/">reportedly</a> played a role in the EU's decision to target Apple with antitrust complaints about its mobile wallet. The company was said to have filed informal complaints about the way Apple restricts third-party apps from accessing the NFC capabilities of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, which led to the EC's Statement of Objections against Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission will now likely seek feedback next month from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept Apple's offer, according to people familiar with the matter who are cited in the report.<br/>
<br/>
This is not the first time that Apple has faced criticism for restricting access to NFC on the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌. Australian banks back in 2017 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/13/australian-banks-access-nfc/">wanted access to NFC</a> in order to launch an alternative to ‌&zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;‌, but they were not successful.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/">NFC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-offers-nfc-apple-pay-rivals-eu/">Apple Offers iPhone NFC Chip Access to Apple Pay Rivals in EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-offers-iphone-nfc-chip-access-to-apple-pay-rivals-in-eu.2413474/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> has won its antitrust lawsuit against Google, after the nine-member jury in the case unanimously agreed that the tech giant abused its power by operating an app store monopoly and charging developers unduly high fees.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/06/fortnite-mobile-100-million-hero.jpg" alt="" width="1450" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-642461" /><br/>
The unanimous verdict came after three hours of deliberation following a four-week trial looking into Google's Play store. Among Epic's allegations were that Google illegally tied together its Play store and Play Billing payment services, leaving developers having to use both for their apps to be included in the store.<br/>
<br/>
Google collects a commission ranging from 15% to 30% on transactions completed within apps, similar to how Apple takes its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> fees.<br/>
<br/>
The jury also agreed that Google's distribution agreement with developers was anticompetitive, and that Epic had been unfairly stifled by the company's behavior by forcing its own billing system on developers. The trial was brought by Epic against Google in 2020 for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/google-pulls-fortnight/">removing Fortnite</a> from the Google Play Store, after Epic allowed players to bypass Google's in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
The reasoning in the jury case was not revealed, but in a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-v-google-trial-verdict-a-win-for-all-developers">statement on its website</a>, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; CEO Tim Sweeney said the verdict "proves that Google's app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation."<br/>
<br/>
Sweeney added that the jury had seen "evidence that Google was willing to pay billions of dollars to stifle alternative app stores by paying developers to abandon their own store efforts and direct distribution plans, and offering highly lucrative agreements with device manufacturers in exchange for excluding competing app stores."<br/>
<br/>
Google said it would appeal. "We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners and the broader Android ecosystem," said Wilson White, vice-president of government affairs and public policy at Google.<br/>
<br/>
The ruling could have profound implications for digital app store regulation, particularly within Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apple won a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">similar case against Epic in 2021</a>. Rather than a jury made up of consumers though, that ruling was made by a single judge. <br/>
<br/>
Epic has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to revive key claims in the Apple case, and Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-epic-appeal-supreme-court/">fighting</a> part of a ruling for Epic regarding Apple's "anti-steering" rule that bars developers of many iOS apps from directing users to methods of purchase available outside of the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌, circumventing Apple's revenue cut.<br/>
<br/>
The Supreme Court will decide in the coming months whether it will hear either or both of Epic's and Apple's appeals, but if it does not take up either petition, the previous rulings will stand. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/epic-wins-antitrust-trial-against-google/">Epic Games Wins Antitrust Lawsuit Against Google Play Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-wins-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-play-store.2413470/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, iOS 17.2 allows you to record spatial video for viewing in the Photos app on Apple's forthcoming Vision Pro headset. Here's how you can do it.<br/>
<br/>

Apple's Vision Pro headset is expected to be released around March 2024. Until then, one way you can prepare for it is to use your iPhone to record videos in a special format called spatial video that is made to be viewed on Apple's headset.<br/>
<br/>
When viewed on iPhone, spatial video appear as normal videos, but they provide an immersive viewing experience on Vision Pro that is almost three-dimensional. Combined with advanced computational videography techniques and HEVC compression, spatial memories are saved in a relatively compact file size, recorded at 30 frames per second at 1080p, and taking up to 130MB of storage space for one minute of video. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Enabling Spatial Video</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max.</li><br/>
<li>Select Camera ➝ Formats.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down to "Video Capture" and toggle on the switch next to Spatial Video for Apple Vision Pro.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/enable-spatial-video.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925920" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Recording Spatial Video</h2><br/>
Apple says that spatial video is best recorded when your iPhone is stable and in landscape orientation. In the Camera app, switch to Video recording and then look for the Vision Pro headset icon in the viewfinder. Tap the icon to switch to spatial video mode. When you are ready to record, simply hit the red record button. <br/>
<br/>

Remember that a spatial video will look like a normal video if you watch it in the Photos app on your iPhone. But there is nothing to stop you from recording special moments in spatial video so that you can experience them on Apple Vision Pro when the headset is released in early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
You can find all of the spatial videos you capture within a new Spatial album in the Photos app, and all of your spatial videos will sync across their devices with iCloud.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/record-spatial-video-iphone/">iOS 17.2: How to Record Spatial Video on iPhone 15 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-how-to-record-spatial-video-on-iphone-15-pro.2413461/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released iOS 17.2, a major update that adds the new Journal app, a Translate option for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Action Button, a Favorites playlist for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxMh7pKD97w" title="iOS 17.2 Available Now: Here&#39;s What&#39;s New!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
In this guide, we've rounded up all of the new features in the iOS 17.2 update.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="journal_app">Journal App</h2><br/>
iOS 17.2 introduces the Journal app that Apple announced as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. With the Journal app, users can record their daily activities and thoughts, with Apple providing optional prompts that can be used as inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918878" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Journal-App-iOS-17-Feature-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2612" height="1469" /><br/>
Journal entries can be added by tapping on the "+" button in the Journal app, and from there, users can choose a suggestion as the basis for their writing or just opt for "New Entry" to write anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
Entries are automatically tagged with a date for organizational purposes, but there are options for bookmarking, too. Journal entries can include images, voice recordings, and location tags.<br/>
<h2 id="messages_app_sticker_reactions">Messages App Sticker Reactions</h2><br/>
You can long press on any chat bubble in the Messages app to add a sticker response that serves as an alternative to a tapback reaction. Tapping on "Add Sticker" lets you choose either a sticker or an emoji to apply to the corner of an iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918892" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-tapback-reply-sticker.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
There was already an option to drag a sticker or an emoji onto any message bubble, but this is a much quicker method of quickly responding to an incoming message with a quick graphic that is more expressive than a tapback reaction.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="spatial_video_recording">Spatial Video Recording</h2><br/>
With iOS 17.2, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are able to record spatial video that will be viewable in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app on the Vision Pro headset that's coming out next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911687" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-apple-visioin-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" /><br/>
Spatial video recording can be enabled by going to the Settings app, tapping into the Camera section, selecting Formats, and toggling on "Spatial Video for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>." Apple says that for best results when recording spatial video, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> should be held stable in landscape orientation while capturing video. Video is recorded at 30 frames per second at 1080p, and one minute of video takes up 130MB of storage space.<br/>
<br/>
When spatial videos captured with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; are viewed on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, they appear as normal videos. Viewing the video in 3D requires the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<h2 id="improved_telephoto_focusing_speed">Improved Telephoto Focusing Speed</h2><br/>
On the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, the Telephoto camera now focuses faster when capturing small, faraway objects.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="favorites_apple_music_playlist">Favorites Apple Music Playlist</h2><br/>
Songs that you have favorited in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app are now automatically aggregated into a Favorites playlist.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918891" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-favorite-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="apple_music_favorite_songs">Apple Music Favorite Songs</h2><br/>
In the Music section of the Settings app, there is an option to add songs to your Music Library when they are favorited. The feature is toggled on by default, but it can be turned off if desired.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922545" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-2-music-add-favorite-songs.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
The option to "Favorite" songs was first added in iOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_music_listening_history_focus_filter">Apple Music Listening History Focus Filter</h2><br/>
Apple added a Focus Filter for the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Listening History feature, so if you want to let someone else use your device to listen to music, you can activate this to turn off the Listening History so their song choices won't affect your recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918906" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-focus-filters.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="action_button_translate">Action Button Translate</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max users can now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-translate-action-button/">choose a new Translate option</a> for the Action button.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918874" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-translate.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
When the Action button is set as Translate, pressing to hold causes the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to pop up a Translate window that listens for spoken text. It is able to translate from one set language to another, using the languages that you have previously set up in the Translate app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2><br/>
Apple added an option to disable inline predictions when typing. It can be accessed by opening up the Settings app, choosing General, going to Keyboard, and scrolling down to the "Show Predictions Inline" option.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922546" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/keyboard-inline-predictions.jpg" alt="" width="1808" height="1017" /><br/>
<br/>
There are also new keyboard layouts for eight Sámi languages.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="imessage_contact_key_verification">iMessage Contact Key Verification</h2><br/>
First previewed in December 2022, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-imessage-contact-key-verification/">iMessage Contact Key Verification</a> is a feature designed for those who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876653" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/Apple-advanced-security-iMessage-Contact-Key-Verification_screen-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Users can ensure that there is no "man in the middle" snooping on iMessage conversations, and there is an option to display a Contact Verification Code so that iMessage users can verify that they're speaking to the correct individual during in-person meetings or on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messages_in_icloud_syncing">Messages in iCloud Syncing</h2><br/>
The "Messages" section in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> in the Settings app has been renamed to "Messages in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;." It shows the total amount of storage that messages are taking up, the number of messages synced to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, and the time of the last sync. There's also a "Sync Now" option to force an update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918896" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-messages-in-icloud.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Apple previously said that additional settings would be synced through Messages in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, like Text Message Forwarding, Send &amp; Receive accounts, and SMS filters across devices, so this may see those additional settings syncing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messages_catch-up">Messages Catch-Up</h2><br/>
If you have a Messages thread that has a lot of activity, you can use the new catch-up arrow to jump to the first unread message in a conversation. It shows up as an arrow in the top right corner of the display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_tv_app">Apple TV App</h2><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">removed the separate tabs</a> for Movies and TV shows in the Store section of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918905" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-tv-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="itunes_app">iTunes App</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/ios-17-2-itunes-store-tv-movie-removed/">eliminated the option</a> to purchase and access TV shows and movies through the iTunes Store app, and is directing users to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app instead. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-17-2-itunes-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926061" /><br/>
<h2 id="phone_and_facetime">Phone and FaceTime</h2><br/>
In the Phone and &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; settings, there's a Share Name and Photo option that uses the Contact Poster. Name and Photo Sharing can be toggled off, set to Contacts Only, or set to Always Ask, which prompts you before sharing that information with others.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922547" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/phone-share-photo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
This setting was previously available for the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="facetime">FaceTime</h2><br/>
If you join a &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; call that includes a contact you have blocked, you will now get a warning. Apple provides warnings when joining a call with a blocked contact, or when a blocked contact is joining a call you're already on.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="emergency_alerts_local_awareness">Emergency Alerts Local Awareness</h2><br/>
Under Notifications &amp; Emergency Alerts in the Settings app, there is a new "Local Awareness" option that can be turned on. Apple says that Local Awareness uses your approximate location to improve the timeliness, accuracy, and reliability of emergency alerts.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918902" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-emergency-local-awareness.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_weather_app_features">New Weather App Features</h2><br/>
Precipitation amounts are shown for the next 10 days to provide more insight into upcoming rain and snow conditions, and there is a wind map snapshot that shows wind patterns and animations for the next 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
An interactive moon calendar provides a visualization of the phase of the moon on any day for the next month.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="weather_widgets">Weather Widgets</h2><br/>
There are new Details, Daily Forecast, and Sunrise/Sunset widgets for the Weather app. Details shows information like precipitation chance, UV index, wind speed, and air quality, while Daily Forecast offers the weather for the next few days in a small widget size. Sunrise/Sunset shows the sunrise and sunset times for each day.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918889" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/weather-app-widgets.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="digital_clock_widget">Digital Clock Widget</h2><br/>
There is a new Digital Clock widget that can be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918894" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-clock-widget.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="contact_posters">Contact Posters</h2><br/>
You can now select rainbow-colored text for your name when setting up a Contact Poster in the Contacts app.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918893" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-contact-poster-rainbow.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="books_page-turning_animation">Books Page-Turning Animation</h2><br/>
There's a "Fast Fade" option for the page-turning animation in the Books app. Apple has also removed the icon that you could turn on to scroll through content quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918897" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-page-turn-animation.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="airplay">AirPlay</h2><br/>
There's now an "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> Receiver" setting that will allow the upcoming &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; headset to stream or share content to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-airplay-handoff.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="memoji">Memoji</h2><br/>
Apple added a "Body" section for Memoji where users can customize waist, bust, shoulders, and arms.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918895" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-memoji-body.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="news_app">News App</h2><br/>
The News app supports Live Activities for following news-related events such as elections.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918899" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-apple-news-live-activities.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="expanded_sensitive_content_warnings">Expanded Sensitive Content Warnings</h2><br/>
Apple's opt-in Sensitive Content Warning feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-expands-sensitive-content-warnings/">is expanding</a> to Contact Posters in the Contacts and Phone apps, as well as in stickers in the Messages app. Sensitive Content Warnings use on-device machine learning to blur out photos or videos with any nudity detected before users view them.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922023" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Sensitive-Content-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
<h2 id="app_store_categories">App Store Categories</h2><br/>
The "Apps" and "Games" sections of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-beta-app-store/">new top bar navigation</a> that allows users to scroll through various app categories, exploring apps in that category with a tap.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922085" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/app-store-categories.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
The categories mirror the categories that can be found at the bottom of each &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; section, and it is a layout that Apple has previously used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="siri">Siri</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> in iOS 17.2 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-allows-siri-to-access-health-data/">can access data</a> from the Health app, so the personal assistant can provide details on Health information. You can, for example, ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; questions like "What's my heart rate?" or "How many steps have I taken today?" if that data is logged in the Health app via an accompanying Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; also provides details on an estimated time of arrival when there are active turn-by-turn directions in the Maps app, and the personal assistant can provide altitude data.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="airdrop">AirDrop</h2><br/>
AirDrop <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/ios-17-namedrop-like-wallet-passes-sharing/">now supports</a> the sharing of boarding passes, movie tickets, and other eligible Wallet app passes by bringing two iPhones next to one another and following the "Share" prompts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/AirDrop-1Pass-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925566" /><br/>
<h2 id="recording_to_an_external_device">Recording to an External Device</h2><br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, ProRes video can be recorded directly to an external device. iOS 17.2 appears to include a new pop up message that lets users know that external recording is not working because of a USB-C cable that is too slow.<br/>
<br/>
There was previously a warning about an external storage device not having a fast enough write speed to support external recording, but now there is an added message about the write speed of the USB-C cable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="applecare_settings">AppleCare Settings</h2><br/>
The "Coverage" section under Settings &gt; General has been renamed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> &amp; Warranty. It still includes &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; info for your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and connected devices such as the Apple Watch and AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924448" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/applecare-warranty-ios-17-2.jpg" alt="" width="2452" height="1379" /><br/>
The &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ "Coverage" menu is now in Settings &gt; General rather than Settings &gt; General &gt; About, making it more visible than before. The Coverage interface lists &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ on your device and any paired AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="default_notification_sound">Default Notification Sound</h2><br/>
Under Sounds &amp; Haptics, there's a "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" /><br/>
All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound, plus there is an option to also change the haptic vibration of default notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="autofill_for_pdfs">AutoFill for PDFs</h2><br/>
Enhanced AutoFill for PDFs identifies fields in PDFs and other documents, and allows them to be filled in with information stored in the contacts app. As with websites, fields like names, addresses, and phone numbers can be autofilled.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="qi2_support">Qi2 Support</h2><br/>
The update adds Qi2 support to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, allowing them to work with wireless chargers that use the Qi2 standard. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models already included Qi2 support.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="wireless_car_charging_bug_fix">Wireless Car Charging Bug Fix</h2><br/>
There is a fix for a bug that was preventing some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-wireless-charging-bug-fix/">iPhones from wirelessly charging</a> on the wireless charging pads included in a select number of vehicles.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists, a feature that Apple has promised for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, won't be coming in 2023. With today's iOS 17.2 release, Apple updated its &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; features list [<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/pdf/iOS_All_New_Features.pdf">PDF</a>] to note that the option to collaborate on playlists has been delayed.<br/>
<br/>

Apple tested collaborative playlists in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">early iOS 17.2 betas</a>, but ended up removing the feature in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-beta-4-features/">fourth iOS 17.2 beta</a>. There were likely bugs in the option that Apple was not able to remedy in time to bring the feature to iOS 17.2, and as iOS 17.2 will be the last publicly available update to &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; in 2023, we won't be getting collaborative playlists until 2024.<br/>
<br/>
In the iOS 17.2 beta, playlists gained a "Collaborate" option that created a link to a playlist, and anyone with access to that link was able to add to the playlist. Users had control over who was able to contribute, with an option to approve each person that asked to join and tools for removing users.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear when collaborative playlists in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; might launch, but we will likely get an iOS 17.3 update in January, with testing to begin in December.<br/>
<br/>
While collaborative playlists did not come in the iOS 17.2 update, Apple did add a Favorites &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; playlist that aggregates songs that are favorited.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">Apple Pushes Collaborative Apple Music Playlists Launch to 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pushes-collaborative-apple-music-playlists-launch-to-2024.2413408/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
