		<description><![CDATA[Samsung's 27-inch ViewFinity S9 5K display has hit a new all-time low price today on Amazon, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0CB71BY87%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,060.42</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.99. The display has an estimated delivery date of December 12 if ordered today.<br/>

<br/>
This price is available directly from Amazon, so if you don't see it make sure you're looking at the right seller. Scroll down to the "new and used" option on the right side of the page and browse through the listings for new models of the display until you see Amazon's seller page and the &#36;1,060.42 price tag.<br/>

Samsung itself is hosting a <a href="https://howl.me/ck9zilTUkVb">monitor sale</a> right now, offering up to 40 percent off select products. This does include the ViewFinity S9 5K display, but it's not quite as low as Amazon's discount. You can still find a few solid markdowns in this sale, with monitors starting at just &#36;349.99 and totaling up to &#36;600 off select models.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iMessage chat service may dodge EU regulatory demands for platform interoperability after all. <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/apple-imessage-set-to-avoid-eu-s-digital-dominance-crackdown">Bloomberg</a></em> reports that an investigation by the bloc's antitrust watchdog has tentatively concluded that the chat service is not popular enough with business users to warrant being subject to the new rules.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
The EU has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/01/dma-eu-law-could-force-major-changes-apple/">working on legislation</a> under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that would have required Apple to make changes to iMessage to make it available on other platforms. The rules will apply to tech giants that meet its "gatekeeper" criteria, force them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers.<br/>
<br/>
The interoperability rules theoretically mean that Meta apps like WhatsApp or Messenger could request to interoperate with Apple's iMessage framework, and Apple would be forced to comply within the EU. But today's report suggests iMessage may fall outside the legislation because it is not widely used by businesses.<br/>
<br/>
The report notes that the possible reprieve for Apple is part of a five-month market investigation by the European Commission, and Apple's exemption has not and will not be officially confirmed until the probe is completed in February.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of the investigation's conclusions, the DMA will likely still force Apple to make major changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> work in Europe.

		<description><![CDATA[Unidentified governments are surveilling smartphone users by tracking push notifications that move through Google's and Apple's servers, a US senator warned on Wednesday (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iOS-16-4-Web-Push.jpeg" alt="" width="794" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-885967" /><br/>
In a letter to the Department of Justice, Senator Ron Wyden said foreign officials were demanding the data from the tech giants to track smartphones. The traffic flowing from apps that send push notifications put the companies "in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps," Wyden said. He asked the Department of Justice to "repeal or modify any policies" that hindered public discussions of push notification spying.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement given to <em>Reuters</em>, Apple said that Wyden's letter gave them the opening they needed to share more details with the public about how governments monitored push notifications.<br/>
<blockquote>"In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information," the company said in a statement. "Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests."</blockquote>According to the report, Wyden's letter said a "tip" was the source of the information about the surveillance. A source familiar with the matter confirmed that both foreign and U.S. government agencies have been asking Apple and Google for metadata related to push notifications. The data is said to have been used to attempt to tie anonymous users of messaging apps to specific Apple or Google accounts.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Reuters</em>' source would not identify which governments were making the data requests but described them as "democracies allied to the United States." They did not know how long the requests had been going on for. <br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification">advises developers</a> not to include sensitive data in notifications and to encrypt any data before adding it to a notification payload. However, this requires action on the developers' part. Likewise, metadata (like which apps are sending notifications and how often) is not encrypted, potentially giving anyone with access to the information insight into users' app usage.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/privacy/">Privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/apple-governments-surveil-push-notifications/">Apple Confirms Governments Using Push Notifications to Surveil Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-governments-using-push-notifications-to-surveil-users.2412959/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has told component suppliers it wants iPhone 16 batteries to be made in India, as part of the company's efforts to diversify its global supply chain and reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-battery-kosutami.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923492" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Leaked image of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/">alleged iPhone 16 Pro battery</a> with new design, updated connector, and 3355mAh capacity.</em></div><br/>
The <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1eee7956-a5be-4df0-a9a9-139c573c4f8f">Financial Times</a></em> reports that Apple has informed battery suppliers including China's Desay and Taiwan's Simplo Technology of its preference to have batteries for next year's iPhone made in India, and has encouraged the manufacturers to establish new factories there or scale up production at existing sites for future orders.<br/>
<br/>
"If all goes well with iPhone 16 battery supply, Apple plans to move more iPhone battery production to India," said one of the people close to Apple who spoke to <em>FT</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already works with Foxconn, Pegatron, and Tata (new owner of Wistron) to manufacture iPhones in India, with Foxconn handling 75 to 80 percent of the device assembly. Foxconn has invested more than &#36;500 million in India to ramp up its manufacturing capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/iphone-17-assembly-india/">believes</a> that 12 to 14 percent of global ‌iPhone‌ shipments are made in India, with that proportion to increase to 20 to 25 percent by 2024. Introductory production on the standard iPhone 17 will start in India in the second half of 2025, according to Kuo, marking the first time that Apple begins development of a new ‌iPhone‌ outside of China.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to allowing Apple to move manufacturing away from China, increasing production in India provides Apple with an opportunity to strengthen its relationship with the Indian government. India is a key market for Apple due to growing demand for Apple products in the country.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/make-iphone-16-batteries-in-india-apple/">Make iPhone 16 Batteries in India, Apple Tells Component Suppliers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/make-iphone-16-batteries-in-india-apple-tells-component-suppliers.2412953/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://ee.co.uk/tv/apple-tv-4k">EE TV</a>, a new broadband TV platform from EE, today launched as a BT TV replacement service in the UK, offering subscribers the option of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K with customized remote control.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ee-tv-apple-tv-4k.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925395" /><br/>
EE TV offers access to more than 70 Freeview channels, a Netflix subscription, as well as premium channels from Sky, Discovery, Eurosport, TNT Sports, and more.<br/>
<br/>
To access the platform, subscribers can opt to receive one of three set-top boxes: A standard EE TV "mini" box, a "pro" EE TV box that includes a hard drive for recording live TV, or – in what EE is calling a "UK-first" – a bespoke &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K set up for EE TV content consumption.<br/>
<br/>
Made in partnership with Apple, the custom &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K features a streamlined setup process and the EE TV app preinstalled, featuring live streaming and on-demand content, with quick access to live channels and third-party apps such as BBC iPlayer, as well as a unified search to find content across multiple platforms. The &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; also comes with a custom EE-branded remote including a special TV guide button and channel rockers.<br/>
<br/>
The EE TV boxes offer a similar hub that combines live broadcast TV, access to UK catch-up and on demand apps, and the ability to buy and rent content, but they lack access to the other services that &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; typically provides. Those new to EE TV are also eligible to six months of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> for free. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ee-apple-tv-remote.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925396" /><br/>
All 24-month contracts come with live free-to-air channels and catchup. The platform also offers a range of additional services and premium channel packages, priced between £4.99 and £76, with customers able to flexibly add or remove packages from month to month. EE also offers subscribers a bonus EE TV Box Mini for "free multi-room TV." For more information, see the <a href="https://ee.co.uk/tv/apple-tv-4k">EE website</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Korean suppliers have begun developing smartphone under-display cameras (UDC), paving the way for the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a true "all-screen" appearance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793995" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=24568">The Elec</a></em>, LG Innotek has entered the preliminary development of the UDC, which sits under the display and does not result in a visible hole in the panel when the camera is not in use.<br/>
<br/>
A UPC differs from a typical front camera module, since it delivers less light to the image sensor. This is because light loss occurs as it passes through the display area before it reaches the camera lens, which can result in a deterioration in image quality and brightness.<br/>
<br/>
To compensate for this, LG Innotek is developing a special "freeform optic" multiple lens system that can reduce optical aberrations and increase the light intensity ratio around the optical module to improve peripheral image quality. LG Innotek has been publishing patents for the technology since December last year, and more are expected now that development has begun.<br/>
<br/>
LG Display, an affiliate of LG Innotek's LG Group, has also started UPC development, according to the report. LG Display aims to increase the UPC's light transmittance to 20% by 2023 and 40% after 2024, bringing it closer to the standard that Apple expects. Apple reportedly already received a UPC sample from an unnamed vendor, but rated it as unsatisfactory in performance.<br/>
<br/>
Before Apple uses the perfected under-screen camera technology, it is expected to adopt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">under-panel Face ID technology in 2025's iPhone 17 Pro</a>. This is expected to be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple will then adopt the UPC in 2027's "Pro" &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, according to respected analyst Ross Young of research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/">The Elec</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-under-display-camera/">&#039;All-Screen&#039; iPhone Under-Display Camera Enters Development</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-screen-iphone-under-display-camera-enters-development.2412943/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> gaming service with several new titles, including <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/disney-dreamlight-valley/id6456945575">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sonic-dream-team/id1609094795">Sonic Dream Team</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/puzzle-dragons-story/id1636844853">Puzzle & Dragons Story</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/turmoil/id6446276883">Turmoil+</a>.<br/>

Disney Dreamlight Valley is a life simulation game starring Disney characters, and it has previously been available on console platforms. The &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; version of the game includes the base version and the A Rift in Time expansion that is a paid option on other platforms.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to other versions of the game, the &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; version does not have in-app purchases and thus does not include Star Path seasons or the Premium Shop.<br/>
<br/>
Sonic Dream Team is a racing game that stars popular Sonic characters, while Puzzle &amp; Dragons Story is an RPG adventure match-3 game. Turmoil+ is an oil rush simulation game that tasks players with digging oil to make money and grow the nearby town.<br/>
<br/>
Many of these games were <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/8-new-games-and-more-than-50-updates-coming-to-apple-arcade-this-holiday-season/">announced back in November</a> following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">October price increase</a> to the &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; service. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; now costs &#36;6.99 per month in the United States, up from &#36;4.99 per month. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; games are free from all in-app purchases and ads.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-arcade-game-additions-december-2023/">Apple Arcade Gains Disney Dreamlight Valley, Puzzle &amp; Dragons Story, and Sonic Dream Team</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-arcade-gains-disney-dreamlight-valley-puzzle-dragons-story-and-sonic-dream-team.2412925/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adventure game "Stray," which is designed to let players take on the role of a daring orange cat, is available for download on the Mac as of today.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="STRAY Launch Trailer" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4uP2MyUL49s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Though the game was first released in 2022, it has been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation and Xbox consoles until today.<br/>
<br/>
In this third-person adventure title, a stray cat's curiosity causes him to get stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria, and the aim in the game is to get back up to the surface using B-12, the cat's drone companion.<br/>
<br/>
Stray asks players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding security bots and evil bacteria. The game is platform-based, so players will need to climb up various obstacles and interact with the environment to open up new pathways.<br/>
<br/>
Since the main character is a cat, players can sneak, sleep, meow at robots, and nuzzle up to NPCs. Stray is limited to Apple silicon Macs, and it uses Metal Upscaling for accelerated graphics performance and high-quality visuals.<br/>
<br/>
Stray can be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stray/id6451498949?mt=12">downloaded from the Mac App Store</a> for &#36;30.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/stray-apple-silicon-macs/">Popular Adventure Game &#039;Stray&#039; Now Available for Apple Silicon Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/popular-adventure-game-stray-now-available-for-apple-silicon-macs.2412922/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The first version of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; came out in March 2016, which means it has been seven years since it launched.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iphone-se-2016.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925333" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; was sold until September 2018, so it has been five years since it was last available for sale, making it eligible for Apple's vintage designation. Products are marked as vintage five years after the device was last sold by Apple, while products are marked as obsolete at the seven year point.<br/>
<br/>
Vintage devices are not guaranteed to be eligible for repairs through Apple or Apple Authorized Service Providers, though Apple will offer repairs if the parts are available.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has continued on with the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; line, and today, it continues to be the only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> fingerprint sensor. There have been three generations released to date, with the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3 introduced in March 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Apple today has also marked the second-generation 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> as vintage, as well as the special edition Mickey Solo3 Wireless headphones. The Powerbeats 2 and Solo2 Wireless headphones are now considered obsolete.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-original-iphone-se-vintage/">Apple&#039;s First iPhone SE Now Considered Vintage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-iphone-se-now-considered-vintage.2412918/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 17.2 addresses a bug that was preventing some iPhones from wirelessly charging on the wireless charging pads included in some vehicles, according to Apple's release notes for the iOS 17.2 RC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">that came out today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-wireless-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1005" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-788160" /><br/>
There <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-15-gm-charging-issue/">have been multiple complaints</a> from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> owners who have had charging issues in their Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Buick vehicles. In some of these cars, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> placed on the wireless charging pad would either not charge at all or start to charge and then stop.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the complaints were from &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; owners, and came after the iOS 17.1 update. General Motors said in November that it was aware of an issue and investigating the problem.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second charging-related bug fix that Apple has implemented in recent weeks. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/">iOS 17.1.1 update</a> that came out in early November addressed an issue that caused some &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models charged in BMW vehicles to lose NFC functionality.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 is expected to see a public release next week. The update also adds the Journal app, a Translate Action button option for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, new features in Messages, Weather and Clock widgets, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">and more</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-wireless-charging-bug-fix/">iOS 17.2 Fixes Bug Preventing Wireless Charging From Working in Some Vehicles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-fixes-bug-preventing-wireless-charging-from-working-in-some-vehicles.2412907/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new firmware update for both the Lightning and USB-C versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2. The new firmware is version 6B34, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/airpods-pro-2-firmware-6b32/">6B32 firmware</a> introduced in November.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware beyond "bug fixes and other improvements," so it is unclear what's new in the update, but prior software releases have been refining functionality introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> such as Adaptive Audio.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not give customers instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">iOS 17.2</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-rc-to-developers/">watchOS 10.2</a>, Siri can access data from the Health app for health and fitness queries, according to Apple's release notes for the updates, which are currently in beta. For the Apple Watch, this functionality is limited to the Series 9 and Ultra 2, as these are the only models that support on-device Siri processing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iOS-17-Health-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906604" /><br/>
For example, Apple says users can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, ask about the progress of closing their Activity rings for the day, or ask about their blood glucose level if they have a connected monitor.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2142151/ios-17-2-watchos-10-2-siri-health-features.html"><em>Macworld</em> shared</a> examples of supported queries:<ul><li>How many steps have I taken today?</li><br/>
<li>How many steps have I taken this week?</li><br/>
<li>What's my heart rate?</li><br/>
<li>What's my blood oxygen level?</li><br/>
<li>Check my Exercise ring.</li><br/>
<li>How does my Move ring look today?</li><br/>
<li>What's my average walking heart rate?</li><br/>
<li>How many calories have I burned?</li></ul>On the Apple Watch, health data is limited to the previous week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Siri is also gaining the ability to log data in the Health app. <em>Macworld</em> shared another list with examples of supported queries:<ul><li>My weight is 195.3 pounds.</li><br/>
<li>I started spotting today.</li><br/>
<li>I've taken my 6 pm medications.</li><br/>
<li>My body temperature is 98.5 degrees.</li><br/>
<li>My period started today.</li><br/>
<li>My blood sugar is 143.</li><br/>
<li>Record my blood pressure as 118 over 76.</li></ul>This functionality must be enabled first to work. On the iPhone, open the Settings app and select Health → Data Access & Devices → Siri, and then toggle on "Access Health Data." On the Apple Watch, open the Settings app and select Health → Apps and Services → Siri, and then toggle on "Allow Siri Access to Health Data."<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 and watchOS 10.2 are expected to be released next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-allows-siri-to-access-health-data/">iOS 17.2 and watchOS 10.2 Allow Siri to Access and Log Health Data</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-and-watchos-10-2-allow-siri-to-access-and-log-health-data.2412897/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Qi2 is a next-generation Qi wireless charging technology that incorporates a Magnetic Power Profile. Qi2 devices will work like accessories that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, using magnets for alignment and speedier charging. Apple added Qi2 support to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models ahead of release, so they are already compatible with the standard.<br/>
<br/>
The Magnetic Power Profile was designed based on ‌&zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;‌ contributions from Apple, and it is being combined with the new Extended Power Profile (EPP) to form what is considered "Qi2." Qi2 is meant to ensure that phones and other battery-powered mobile products are perfectly aligned with chargers for improved energy efficiency and faster charging. It will allow for new accessories that would not be chargeable wirelessly using existing flat surface-to-flat surface devices.<br/>
<br/>
While Qi2 chargers will be able to charge devices at up to 15W, it is not yet clear if Apple's iPhones will support faster wireless charging speeds with Qi2 accessories. For the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, for example, Apple's technical specifications page says that the devices still support Qi wireless charging "up to 7.5W" despite the fact that they work with Qi2.<br/>
<br/>
The first Qi2 accessories are set to launch during the holiday season.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qi2/">Qi2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-qi-iphone-13-14-models/">iOS 17.2 Brings Qi2 Support to iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-brings-qi2-support-to-iphone-13-and-iphone-14-models.2412896/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate versions (RCs) of upcoming iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-releases-ios-17-2-beta-4/">the fourth betas of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>. The RCs represent the final version of the software that is expected to be provided to the public. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918852" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Cool.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest new feature in iOS 17.2 is the Journal app, which can be used to record daily activities and thoughts. You can write about your day to day life, but Apple also provides topic suggestions based on the music you listen to, the places you visit, and the people you see. Journal entries support pictures, voice recordings, and location information, with the app organized by entry date.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, there's a Favorites playlist that houses everything you've favorited, plus Apple added support for collaborative playlists. You can now share a playlist with multiple people, and each participant can add songs.<br/>

Stickers can now be used to reply to iMessages when you long press on a chat bubble in the Messages app, and there's also now support for the extra-secure iMessage Contact Key Verification option.

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.2 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes, but tvOS 17.2 introduces an overhauled &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
The app now includes a sidebar that houses content from both Apple's services and streaming services that integrate with the tvOS Watch Now feature. There are dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>‌, MLS Season Pass, Sports, the Store, and the Library at the top of the sidebar, along with dedicated sections for streaming services like ABC, CBS, Comedy Central, Hulu, ESPN, Discovery, Peacock, Prime Video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
You can click into each streaming service to see content that's available specifically on that service, and there's also a new My TV section that replaces "My Channels."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-rc-to-developers/">Apple Seeds tvOS 17.2 Release Candidate to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-release-candidate-to-developers.2412888/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beeper Mini, a new app that ostensibly brings iMessage to Android devices with no need for sign-in with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> credentials, today launched <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeper.ima">on the Google Play Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/beeper-mini.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925247" /><br/>
Beeper Mini operates by identifying text message conversations from iMessage users and converting them to the recognizable blue bubbles associated with Apple's exclusive messaging service. This enables Android users to interact with iMessage features such as reactions, threads, high-quality media sharing, and group chats, without the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users noticing any difference.<br/>
<br/>
The app represents a departure from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/nothing-announces-imessage-compatibility/">previous methods</a> of accessing iMessage on non-Apple devices, which typically involved relaying messages through a Mac hosted in the cloud or signing in with an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;. Beeper Mini's approach involves direct communication with Apple's servers by registering a user's phone number with iMessage, a process that apparently required extensive reverse engineering of Apple's messaging system.<br/>
<br/>
<iframe width="477" height="848" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B19HBmw0gKU" title="iMessage for Android is Here Right Now | Beeper Mini" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
Beeper is a startup led by Eric Migicovsky that aims to consolidate various messaging services into a single platform. Since its initial launch on desktop devices in 2021, Beeper raised &#36;16 million in funding. Beeper claims that Beeper Mini does not access messages, contacts, or &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; passwords. The app's code will also be made open source, offering transparency and allowing for independent review.<br/>
<br/>
Beeper Mini is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeper.ima">now available for download</a> on the Google Play Store, with a seven-day free trial followed by a subscription fee of &#36;2 per month. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/">iMessage</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android/">Beeper Mini Brings iMessage to Android With No Need for Apple ID Sign-In</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android-with-no-need-for-apple-id-sign-in.2412881/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Twelve South says that when closed, the ButterFly is about the size of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> case. When unfolded, a small strip of vegan leather connects the magnetic fast charger for Apple Watch and MagSafe-compatible charger for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or AirPods.<br/>

You can fold the accessory into a hands-free display stand for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or tilt the Apple Watch magnetic charger up and use Nightstand Mode. The device includes a 30W USB-C power adapter and four international plug adapters. <br/>
