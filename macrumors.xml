		<description><![CDATA[Satechi today added a range of new accessories to its line of FindAll products, all of which integrate with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> app. Satechi is debuting a new FindAll Luggage Tag, a FindAll Keychain, a FindAll Card, and a FindAll Glasses Case. Satechi's FindAll products work like Apple's AirTags, but come in different shapes and sizes that are more convenient than the &#36;29 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-findall-devices.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003119" /><br/>
The <a href="https://satechi.net/products/vegan-leather-findall-keychain">FindAll Keychain</a>, priced at &#36;30, is an alternative to the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;. It is made from a vegan leather material and can be attached to keys or any other item with the included keyring. The battery lasts for up to 12 months before it needs to be recharged.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-keys.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003120" /><br/>
Satechi's <a href="https://satechi.net/products/vegan-leather-findall-luggage-tag">FindAll Luggage Tag</a> is &#36;44.99 and also made of the same vegan leather material as many of the FindAll products. It is designed to attach to a suitcase, and it includes a name card slot that's protected with a privacy flap and an adjustable strap. Since it looks like a regular luggage tag, it is more covert than an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;. Its battery lasts for up to eight months before needing to be recharged.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/luggage-keys-findall.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003121" /><br/>
For wallets, the <a href="https://satechi.net/products/findall-card">FindAll Card</a> is &#36;34.99. It is sized to fit inside a wallet, and it is made from aluminum and tempered glass. To ensure that it can withstand any conditions, it features IP67 water resistance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-card-findall.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003122" /><br/>
To keep glasses or sunglasses safe and easy to find, Satechi offers the &#36;49.99 <a href="https://satechi.net/products/vegan-leather-findall-glasses-case">FindAll Glasses Case</a>. The Glasses Case has a collapsible design that folds out to accommodate a pair of glasses, with a microsuede lining to prevent scratches and a magnetic closure. The battery in the case lasts for up to eight months before it needs to be recharged.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-sunglasses.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003123" /><br/>
The FindAll devices can be purchased in black, white, or desert rose, and they recharge wirelessly with a Qi, Qi2, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charger. All of the products can be added to the Items tab in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, and can be tracked alongside Apple devices. Apple's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network is able to leverage nearby Apple devices owned by other people to get location information when a device is out of Bluetooth range.<br/>
<br/>
The new FindAll products can be <a href="https://satechi.net">purchased from the Satechi website </a>as of today.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/satechi/">Satechi</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/satechi-findall-lineup/">Satechi Expands Find My Lineup with Rechargeable Luggage Tag, Glasses Case, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/satechi-expands-find-my-lineup-with-rechargeable-luggage-tag-glasses-case-and-more.2457820/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the United States, the Apple Card offers a high-yield savings account option, allowing you to earn far more interest on your money compared to the average bank's basic savings account. However, the account's interest rate was lowered this week, with the annual percentage yield (APY) <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-card-savings-account-rate-lowered-again/">dropping from 3.75% to 3.65%</a>.<br/>
<br/>

If you deposited &#36;1,000 into the account, and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn &#36;36.50 in interest based on the current APY.<br/>

<br/>
Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. To open an account, you must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/">is &#36;1 million</a>, up from &#36;250,000 originally.<br/>
<br/>
When the account launched, Apple and Goldman Sachs offered an APY of 4.15%, but the rate has fluctuated, often in line with U.S. Federal Reserve benchmark rate changes. The APY peaked at 4.5% in early 2024, and the current 3.65% is an all-time low.<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots in it, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up next to Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs may <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/goldman-sachs-apple-card-partnership-end-early/">end its consumer lending partnership with Apple early</a>, but it is unclear if this will have any impact on Apple Card holders. According to a report earlier this year, there were at least <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/apple-card-new-partner-talks/">three companies vying to replace Goldman Sachs</a> as the Apple Card's financial partner, including Barclays, Synchrony, and JPMorgan Chase. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/01/visa-american-express-apple-card-deal/">Visa or American Express</a> may succeed Mastercard as the Apple Card's payment processor.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-card-savings-account-comparison/">Apple Card Savings Account vs. Competitors: Which Can Earn You More?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-account-vs-competitors-which-can-earn-you-more.2457818/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<category>Apple Genuine Parts Distributor Program</category>
		<category>Right to Repair</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that it recently launched a <a href="https://support.apple.com/genuine-parts-distributor">Genuine Parts Distributor program</a> in the U.S. and Europe, broadening access to genuine repair parts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-Self-Service-Repair.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976474" /><br/>
The program allows repair shops that do not have a direct relationship with Apple to order genuine Apple parts via third-party distributors, including <a href="https://www.mobilesentrix.com/gapp/">MobileSentrix</a> and <a href="https://www.mobileparts.shop/en/page/genuine-apple-parts-service">Mobileparts.shop</a>. Currently, these distributors are offering display, battery, camera, and charging port components for the iPhone 12 series and newer, and SIM card trays are available for the iPhone X and newer. Apple said that iPad parts will be available starting tomorrow. <br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 include a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/11/ios-18-repair-assistant/">Repair Assistant feature</a> for completing post-repair configuration on a device, if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
This new program has fewer limitations compared to Apple's existing <a href="https://support.apple.com/irp-program">Independent Repair Provider program</a>. Repair shops do not need to apply to be part of the program, technicians do not need to be certified by Apple, and repairs are not limited to devices with expired warranty coverage. On the other hand, the Independent Repair Provider program provides access to parts for select Macs and a wider range of iPhone models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple now provides both repair shops and customers with access to genuine parts, tools, and repair manuals through a variety of programs, including the Self-Service Repair program, the Independent Repair Provider program, and now the Genuine Parts Distributor program. As always, customers can also take their devices to the Genius Bar at an Apple Store or to an Apple Authorized Service Provider for repairs.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today, Apple announced that the Self-Service Repair program <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-launches-self-service-repair-for-ipad/">now covers select iPad models</a>, and it will be launching in Canada this summer.<br/>
<br/>
All three programs launched amid mounting "Right to Repair" legislation in the U.S. and other countries over the past several years.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/right-to-repair/">Right to Repair</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-genuine-parts-distributor-program/">Apple Now Offers More Repair Shops Expanded Access to Genuine Parts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-offers-more-repair-shops-expanded-access-to-genuine-parts.2457817/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has low prices across <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZDC3WW5%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">nearly the entire M4 MacBook Air</a> lineup, with up to &#36;223 off both 13-inch and 15-inch models. Some of the notebooks in this sale are seeing delayed delivery estimates, with most arriving in early or mid June, but if you're interested you can lock in these deals now ahead of those delivery dates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M4-MacBook-Air-13-and-15-inch-Feature-Pink-and-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994260" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the 13-inch models, Amazon has up to &#36;182 off all three of the new configurations of this notebook. Prices start at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZDC3WW5%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;867.88</strong></a> for the 256GB model, then raise to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZDB9JTT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,037.19</strong></a> for the 16GB/512GB model and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZDBHQPQ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,216.87</strong></a> for the 24GB/512GB model. While the 256GB model is a solid second-best price, the latter two models are new record low prices for the M4 MacBook Air.<br/>

<br/>
Moving to the larger display models, Amazon has both 512GB versions of the 15-inch M4 MacBook Air on sale this week, as well as the 256GB model. The 16GB/512GB model is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZDBS1YD%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,236.59</strong></a> and the 24GB/512GB model is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZDBQD4K%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,375.85</strong></a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/logic-pro-amplifies-beat-making-on-mac-and-ipad-with-advanced-new-capabilities/">announced</a> that it has updated its professional music-making app Logic Pro with several new features on the Mac and iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Logic-Pro-Amplifies-Beat-Making-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1103" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003164" /><br/>
First, a new Flashback Capture feature lets you recover a performance that otherwise may have been lost because you forgot to set Logic Pro to record.<br/>
<br/>
Next, there are enhancements to the Stem Splitter feature that allows you to extract stems from an audio track for vocals, bass, drums, and other instrumental parts. With today's update, Apple says Stem Splitter now supports guitar and piano, and the feature now offers even greater audio fidelity. Stem Splitter requires a Mac with an M1 chip or newer, or an iPad with an A12 Bionic chip or newer running iPadOS 18.4 or later.<br/>
<br/>
The new version of Logic Pro also includes a new Dancefloor Rush sound pack for the Mac and iPad, offering drum-and-bass sounds with over 400 dynamic loops and punchy drum kits. Two more sound packs added to the Mac app include Magnetic Imperfections with analog tape sounds, and Tosin Abasi with progressive metal guitar sounds.<br/>
<br/>
On the Mac, Logic Pro's built-in notepad now supports Apple Intelligence's Writing Tools.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/-/id634148309">Logic Pro version 11.2 for Mac</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logic-pro-for-ipad/id1615087040">version 2.2 for iPad</a> are available now in the App Store, as free updates for existing users. In the U.S., Logic Pro costs &#36;199.99 on the Mac for new users, and &#36;4.99 per month or &#36;49 per year on the iPad.<br/>
<br/>
For a list of all new features and changes introduced today, read Apple's full <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109503">release notes for the latest versions of the Mac app</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/101628">iPad app</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/logic-pro/">Logic Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-updates-logic-pro/">Apple Updates Logic Pro for Mac and iPad With Several New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-updates-logic-pro-for-mac-and-ipad-with-several-new-features.2457813/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The interest rate on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>'s savings account was today lowered from 3.75% to 3.65%—an all-time low.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/apple-card-savings-account-feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-980867" /><br/>
The drop follows the last <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/apple-card-savings-rate-lowered/">interest rate cut</a> in March, where it reduced from 3.9% to 3.75%. If you deposited &#36;1,000 into the account, and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn &#36;36.50 in interest based on the current annual percentage yield (APY).<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced its high-yield savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a> in partnership with Goldman Sachs. Available in the Wallet app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, the account features no fees, no minimum deposit, and no minimum balance requirements. To be eligible, users must have an &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, reside in the U.S., and be at least 18 years old.<br/>
<br/>
The account enables &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users to earn interest on both their Daily Cash rewards and any additional funds deposited via a linked bank account or Apple Cash. The balance cap <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/">was raised to &#36;1 million</a>, up from the previous limit of &#36;250,000.<br/>
<br/>
At launch, the APY was set at 4.15%, but it has varied in response to U.S. Federal Reserve rate changes. It reached a peak of 4.5% in early 2024, while the current rate sits at a record low of 3.65%.<br/>
<br/>
To get started, open the Wallet app, select your &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, tap the three-dot icon, go to Daily Cash, and tap "Set Up" next to Savings.<br/>
<br/>
While Goldman Sachs is reportedly looking to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/goldman-sachs-apple-card-partnership-end-early/">exit its partnership with Apple early</a>, it remains unclear whether this will impact current &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users. Recent reports indicate that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/apple-card-new-partner-talks/">Barclays, Synchrony, and JPMorgan Chase</a> are among the contenders to become the new financial partner.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-card-savings-account-rate-lowered-again/">Apple Card Savings Account&#039;s Interest Rate Lowered Again</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-accounts-interest-rate-lowered-again.2457807/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Ordered to Change App Store in Europe Again</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has been given until June 22 to bring the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> into full compliance with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) or face recurring financial penalties following a €500 million fine imposed in April.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
The European Commission yesterday <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202522/DMA_100109_906.pdf">published</a> its complete 67-page ruling outlining Apple's violations of the DMA's anti-steering provisions. The Commission concluded that Apple's business terms continue to restrict developers' ability to inform users about alternative payment methods outside the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and to facilitate transactions through external platforms. <br/>
<br/>
The Commission determined that Apple's remaining restrictions contravene Article 5(4) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1925, which mandates that designated gatekeepers must allow app developers to communicate freely with their users and offer competing payment systems without being subject to unfair conditionsg or excessive fees.<br/>
<br/>
The Digital Markets Act came into force in November 2022 and became applicable to designated gatekeepers in 2023. It prohibits platform owners like Apple from using its market position to impose anti-competitive limitations on how developers operate within or outside their ecosystems. The law explicitly requires that gatekeepers enable developers to inform users about more favorable offers available outside the gatekeeper's platform, to include links to external payment methods, and to do so free of charge.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously argued that its newly introduced business terms, which allow developers to add one external link per app to direct users to their own websites, met the DMA's requirements. Under these rules, developers are required to follow a standardized Apple-designed flow, which includes an interstitial warning screen that appears before users are redirected to external sites. In addition, Apple prohibits developers from pre-filling user-specific data such as login credentials or purchase details into the URL used for redirection.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these changes, the Commission found that Apple's implementation falls significantly short of the law's intent and legal requirements. According to the ruling, developers are still unable to promote alternative payment systems within their apps in a meaningful way, and the structure imposed by Apple continues to create friction and discourage user redirection. Furthermore, Apple still imposes a 27% commission on any digital purchases made through external websites linked from within an app, which is only slightly lower than the 30% standard in-app purchase commission and allegedly undermines the concept of allowing free steering.<br/>
<br/>
The Commission rejected Apple's interpretation of the DMA, in which the company claimed it was only required to "allow" steering, not to "facilitate" it. In its ruling, the Commission said that Apple's technical and procedural barriers had the effect of discouraging developers from directing users to external purchasing options and therefore violated the law. It added that Apple had "not put forward any convincing arguments calling into question the serious gravity of the non-compliance." The ruling also criticized Apple's claim that its measures were designed to protect user security and privacy. <br/>
<br/>
In a statement provided to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/27/apple-dma-30-days-deadline/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> following the publication of the full ruling, Apple said:<blockquote>There is nothing in the 70-page decision released today that justifies the European Commission's targeted actions against Apple, which threaten the privacy and security of our users in Europe and force us to give away our technology for free. Their decision and unprecedented fine came after the Commission continuously moved the goalposts on compliance, and repeatedly blocked Apple's months-long efforts to implement a new solution. The decision is bad for innovation, bad for competition, bad for our products, and bad for users. While we appeal, we'll continue engaging with the Commission to advocate on behalf of our European customers.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Apple has until June 22 to rectify the issues or face "periodic penalty payments." These ongoing fines would be determined based on the seriousness of the infringement and the company's revenue. Apple must also pay the initial €500 million fine by July 23 or begin accruing interest.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ordered-to-change-app-store-in-europe-again/">Apple Ordered to Change App Store in Europe Again</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ordered-to-change-app-store-in-europe-again.2457805/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/m3-ipad-air-blue.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-996101" /><br/>
The program will provide &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; owners with manuals, genuine Apple parts, Apple Diagnostics troubleshooting sessions, tools, and rental toolkits to conduct their own repairs. It will now support the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and later), <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> (M4), <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> (A17 Pro), and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; (A16) starting tomorrow for display, battery, camera, and charging port repairs. <br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the &zwnj;Self Service Repair&zwnj; program in 2022 to support individuals who are comfortable with undertaking their own device repairs, with the same resources used by Apple. &zwnj;Self Service Repair&zwnj; now supports 65 Apple devices, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>. The program is set to expand to Canada this summer, becoming the 34th country to offer it.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also today <a href="https://support.apple.com/genuine-parts-distributor">revealed more details</a> about its Genuine Parts Distributor program, which allows businesses who do not have a direct service relationship with Apple to order genuine Apple service parts and components. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; displays, batteries, and charging ports can be ordered from MobileSentrix in the U.S., and MobileSentrix and Mobileparts.shop in Europe.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/">Self Service Repair</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-launches-self-service-repair-for-ipad/">Apple Launches Self Service Repair for iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-self-service-repair-for-ipad.2457800/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> update could make it easier for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to transfer an eSIM to an Android smartphone, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/ios-19-esim-transfer-to-android-3561644/">Android Authority</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Phone-App-Icon-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954687" /><br/>
The site found strings in the Android 16 beta version of Google's SIM Manager that reference a new "Transfer to Android" feature. The setting would include an option for wirelessly transferring an eSIM from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to an Android phone.<br/>
<br/>
While it is simple to transfer an eSIM from &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, that is not true when trying to transfer an eSIM from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to an Android device as of right now. Moving from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to an Android phone typically requires contacting a carrier, but that might not be the case in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Transfer to Android could be added to the "Transfer or Reset &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;" interface that's located under the General section of the Settings app. Apple may expand the eSIM Quick Transfer feature for swapping an eSIM between iPhones to Android devices, plus it looks like there may be a QR code backup in case a wireless connection fails.<br/>
<br/>
Code in the Google SIM Manager suggests that &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; will be required to initiate a transfer, hence why it may be an &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; feature.<br/>
<blockquote>On your other device, go to <b>Settings</b> app > <b>General</b> > <b>Transfer or Reset iPhone</b> > <b>Transfer to Android</b> > <br/>
<br/>
<b>"Still can't connect wirelessly?"</b>" Make sure your other device is running iOS 19 or later versions."</blockquote><br/>
We could perhaps hear more about the eSIM transferring feature at WWDC, though it may also be something that's quietly introduced. Google could also be working on a reciprocal feature that would make it easier for an Android user to transfer to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/ios-19-esim-android-transfer/">iOS 19 Might Make Transferring an eSIM From an iPhone to an Android Phone Easier</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-19-might-make-transferring-an-esim-from-an-iphone-to-an-android-phone-easier.2457788/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Texas Governor Greg Abbott today signed into law the App Store Accountability Act, which will require Apple and Google to verify the age of App Store and Play Store users, respectively. The law will require users who are under the age of 18 to receive parental consent to download apps or make in-app purchases, according <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/texas-poised-enforce-age-verification-apple-google-app-stores-2025-05-27/">to <em>Reuters</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook had <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/tim-cook-called-texas-governor-to-stop-online-child-safety-legislation-22858ad4">reportedly</a> asked Abbott to veto the legislation on a phone call, but evidently his attempt was unsuccessful.<br/>
<br/>
The bill had already passed both the Senate and House of Representatives in Texas, and now that it has been signed by Abbott, it will take effect on January 1, 2026. Texas is the second U.S. state to pass a child safety law of this kind, following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/utah-app-store-age-verification-law/">Utah in March</a>. Utah's law took effect earlier this month, but it will not be fully enforced until next year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/apple-child-age-verification-overhaul/">several new child safety measures</a> in February, after these bills were proposed. While setting up an iPhone or iPad running iOS 18.4 or iPadOS 18.4 or later, the person who will be using the device must select their age range, with the available options including 12 or younger, 13 to 18, and 19 or older. If the account is for a child under the age of 13, there is a Connect to Family option. A parent needs to provide consent for a child to use the ‌App Store‌ and other features, with Face ID or Touch ID authentication required.<br/>
<br/>
It remains to be seen if Apple's expanded age-verification measures will be enough to fully satisfy the laws in Texas and Utah, and others that may follow.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and Google both opposed these age verification laws, citing privacy concerns related to having to collect age information for all users.<br/>
<br/>
"If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it's an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores," said Apple.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-child-safety-features/">Apple Child Safety Features</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/texas-signs-app-store-age-verification-law/">Texas Governor Signs Off on App Store Law Against Tim Cook&#039;s Wishes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/texas-governor-signs-off-on-app-store-law-against-tim-cooks-wishes.2457784/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a standalone multi-platform app for games, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/apple-to-debut-dedicated-gaming-app-within-days-of-switch-2-s-arrival">Bloomberg</a></em>. The app will let Apple users launch games, plus it will have sections for in-game achievements, leaderboards, editorial content, and communication.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-Arcade-hero.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984891" /><br/>
Apple plans to preinstall the app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Mac, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> later this year, which corresponds with the launch timing of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>, macOS 16, and tvOS 19. The gaming app will debut at the Worldwide Developers Conference that's set to take place on June 9.<br/>
<br/>
The upcoming app is set to replace Game Center, which Apple has long used for inviting friends to play mobile games and tracking achievements. While Apple plans to use the new gaming app to promote <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, it will include all of the third-party games that are currently located in the Games section of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like Apple is aiming to split out the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;'s gaming, making it easier for customers to find and download games on their devices. On the Mac, the app will also "tap into" games that are downloaded outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/">Mac App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While the gaming app will be previewed at WWDC, it will roll out to iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TVs in September when the operating systems launch to the public.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/apple-ios-19-gaming-app/">Apple to Launch Dedicated Gaming App in iOS 19</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-dedicated-gaming-app-in-ios-19.2457782/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has purchased game studio RAC7, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/">Digital Trends</a></em>. RAC7 is a small, two-person company that developed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> game Sneaky Sasquatch, and the acquisition was confirmed by an Apple spokesperson.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/sneaky-sasquatch.jpg" alt="" width="1028" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003079" /><br/>
From <em>Digital Trends</em>:<br/>
<blockquote>We love Sneaky Sasquatch and are excited that the 2-person RAC7 team has joined Apple to continue their work on it with us. We will continue to deliver a great experience for Apple Arcade players with hundreds of games from many of the best game developers in the world.</blockquote><br/>
RAC7 will become an internal game studio within Apple, and Apple purchased the company to help Sneaky Sasquatch continue to grow on &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;. Sneaky Sasquatch was one of the first games to launch on &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; when the service went live, and it has continued to be popular with subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already works with developers and game companies to create titles for &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;, but this is the company's first game studio acquisition. <em>Digital Trends</em> notes that Apple does not appear to be implementing a new gaming strategy, describing the RAC7 acquisition as a unique situation.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; is Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/">subscription gaming service</a>, priced at &#36;6.99 per month. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; has hundreds of games, with no additional subscription fees or in-app purchases.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/apple-acquires-gaming-studio-rac7/">Apple Acquires Gaming Studio RAC7</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-acquires-gaming-studio-rac7.2457780/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To complete the challenge, Apple Watch owners will need to record a running workout of at least five kilometers (aka a 5K run) on June 4.<br/>
<blockquote>Let's run this one together. On June 4, record a running workout and go at least 5K (3.1 mi) to earn this special badge. Record it with any app that adds workouts to Health.</blockquote><br/>
Completing the challenge will provide Apple Watch users with a dedicated award in the Fitness app along with animate stickers that can be used in the Messages app.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-invites/id6472498645?eventid=6745800884">updated the Invites app</a> to introduce a new option to add a link to an invitation. Event creators can use the feature to send important details to invitees.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988154" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/General-Apple-Invites-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple says that links can be used for things like planning a trip, adding a gift registry, or working out who is bringing what to a potluck. Links are open ended, so any website can be added to an invite that you create.<br/>
<br/>
Links are located in a new "Tiles" section in the Invites app. Tapping on "Add Tile" at the bottom of the app allows for link insertion, with users able to include the link, a link title, and a link description.<br/>
<br/>
Introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/04/apple-launches-new-invites-app/">earlier this year</a>, Invites is an event planning app designed by Apple. It supports creating custom invitations with unique background images, fonts, and relevant information like directions and weather. Today's 1.2 app update is the first feature update that Invites has received.<br/>
<br/>
Invites is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>+ service, and an &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ subscription is needed to create an event. &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ is Apple's paid &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; storage upgrade option, with plans that start at &#36;0.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
While an &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ subscription is needed for creating an event, anyone can respond to an invitation through an RSVP feature. Invitations can be sent to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users and Android users alike, with the app facilitating planning and RSVPs.<br/>
<br/>
The Invites app can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for free.

		<description><![CDATA[A <a href="https://cellularinsights.com/comparative-5g-performance-report-android-smartphones-vs-iphone-16e/">new Cellular Insights report</a> commissioned by Qualcomm has found that two unnamed Android smartphone models equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 and Snapdragon X80 modems achieved faster 5G speeds compared to the iPhone 16e, which is equipped with Apple's first-ever, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">custom-designed C1 modem</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-iPhone-16e-C1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990833" /><br/>
Testing was conducted with T-Mobile's sub-6GHz 5G network in New York City, across a variety of real-world environments, according to Cellular Insights.<br/>
<br/>
The report found that the Android devices "consistently outperformed" the iPhone 16e in terms of 5G connectivity, especially indoors. Specifically, the Android devices achieved up to 35% faster download speeds compared to the iPhone 16e, and up to 91% faster upload speeds. The report also found that the iPhone 16e frequently became hot to the touch during testing, but it could not confirm if this directly impacted performance.<br/>
<br/>
The two Android smartphones were priced at &#36;619 and &#36;799 in the U.S., the report said, while the iPhone 16e starts at &#36;599.<br/>
<br/>
Based on its findings, Cellular Insights concluded that the Qualcomm-powered devices "hold a clear edge" over the iPhone 16e for individuals seeking "consistent, high-throughput 5G performance." Qualcomm's PR department is now touting the favorable results, which they relayed to us in an email sent earlier today.<br/>
<br/>
The full report is <a href="https://cellularinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5G-sub6-Report-Final-Cellular-Insights.pdf">available as a PDF</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's C1 modem achieved equal to faster performance than some Qualcomm modems <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-c1-modem-5g-speed-tests/">in some earlier tests</a>, but a Qualcomm spokesperson said this study is the "only comprehensive, scientific" comparison completed on a U.S. network so far.<br/>
<br/>
Performance is not the only metric that matters for a smartphone modem, with power efficiency also being an important factor. Apple has advertised the C1 modem as being the most power-efficient iPhone modem ever, which contributes to the iPhone 16e offering the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/">longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone model ever</a>. With its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/">next-generation C2 and C3 modems</a>, Apple hopes to continue to close the gap on the performance front.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/c1/">C1</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/qualcomm-vs-iphone-16e-study/">Android Phones With Qualcomm Modems Top iPhone 16e in New 5G Test</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/android-phones-with-qualcomm-modems-top-iphone-16e-in-new-5g-test.2457774/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is testing a 200-megapixel camera sensor, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>, a user with a large following on Chinese social media platform Weibo. The account has previously shared accurate information about Apple's future products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Cameras.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913544" /><br/>
While the <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PtJ4ZzwhL">account's post today</a> does not provide any further details, this 200-megapixel camera sensor would likely be for the main rear camera on a future high-end iPhone model. Samsung introduced a 200-megapixel rear camera <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/01/samsung-galaxy-s23-lineup/">on its Galaxy S23 Ultra in 2023</a>, and the follow-up S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra models also have one.<br/>
<br/>
With a 200-megapixel camera, an iPhone would be able to shoot photos with greater detail. The increased megapixel count would also result in higher-resolution photos, which can be cropped further and printed at larger sizes without a loss of image quality.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/">entirely 48-megapixel cameras</a>, so the 200-megapixel camera is unlikely to be available this year. In addition, a 200-megapixel camera has yet to be rumored for the iPhone 18 Pro models. Ultimately, the upgraded camera specification could be at least a few years away.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/iphone-200-megapixel-camera-rumor/">iPhone Rumored to Get 200MP Camera Like Samsung&#039;s Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-rumored-to-get-200mp-camera-like-samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra.2457771/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are not expected to launch until September, there are already plenty of rumors about the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Pro-Blue-Feature-Tighter-Crop.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999328" /><br/>
Below, we recap key changes rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro models as of May 2025:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Aluminum frame:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-pro-models-aluminum-frame-rumor/">have an aluminum frame</a>, whereas the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have a titanium frame, and the iPhone X through iPhone 14 Pro have a stainless steel frame. The back of the devices will supposedly have a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/iphone-17-pro-dummies-highlight-apples-new-design/">"part-aluminum, part-glass" design.</a></li><br/>
<li><strong>Rectangular camera bump:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/iphone-17-pro-no-two-tone-rear-design/">large rectangular camera bump</a> with rounded corners. Apple apparently plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/iphone-17-pro-to-stick-with-triangular-camera/">stick with a triangular arrangement</a> for the rear camera lenses.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Sky Blue finish:</strong> Like the latest MacBook Air, the iPhone 17 Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/iphone-17-pro-sky-blue-color/">rumored to be available in a Sky Blue color</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Larger battery:</strong> The iPhone 17 Pro Max is rumored to have a slightly thicker design that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/">allows for a larger battery</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>A19 Pro chip:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to use Apple's next-generation A19 Pro chip, which will reportedly be manufactured <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/">with TSMC's newer third-generation 3nm process</a>. Like usual, expect modest year-over-year performance gains and power efficiency improvements compared to the current iPhones.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip:</strong> All four iPhone 17 models are rumored to get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-17-air-wifi-7-rumor/">Wi-Fi 7 chip designed by Apple</a> rather than Broadcom.</li><br/>
<li><strong>24-megapixel front camera:</strong> All four iPhone 17 models are said to feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/">upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera</a>, whereas all iPhone 16 models are equipped with a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been embroiled in a battle with Apple over its satellite connectivity features, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-satellite-ambitions-threatened-elon-musk-internal-resistance"><em>The Information</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-Satellite-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2072" height="1166" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-977666" /><br/>
The report claims when SpaceX CEO Elon Musk heard that Apple was planning to announce a satellite connectivity feature for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14 in partnership with Globalstar, he approached the company with an offer. He proposed that SpaceX would exclusively provide satellite connectivity to iPhones for 18 months, for an upfront cost of &#36;5 billion. After that, Apple would pay SpaceX &#36;1 billion per year for Starlink service.<br/>
<br/>
Musk threatened that if Apple did not agree to a deal with SpaceX within 72 hours, he would announce a similar satellite feature on his own that could work with iPhones. Apple rejected the proposal, and two weeks before the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 was announced SpaceX revealed a partnership with T-Mobile that allowed smartphone users to send and receive text messages in areas with no reception using Starlink.<br/>
<br/>
SpaceX has also filed legal challenges to Globalstar's use of the radio spectrum it has licensed, which could cripple the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s satellite service if they succeed. As part of this litigation, SpaceX challenged Globalstar's application to launch new satellites in 2023, accusing the satellite company of underutilizing the spectrum it already possessed. SpaceX accused the company of trying to block competition by hogging spectrum for itself.<br/>
<br/>
SpaceX also named Apple in the regulatory filings, which apparently irked Apple executives who wanted to keep their distance from the conflict. Moreover, Apple employees are said to believe that Musk's close relationship with the Trump administration could give him an advantage over Apple and others with the FCC.<br/>
<br/>
More recently, Apple and SpaceX have clashed over how far Apple would support SpaceX's partnership with T-Mobile. Over the past year, Musk asked Apple to support the T-Mobile satellite feature across a broad range of its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, which would help maximize the potential market for the service, but Apple was reluctant to support the service on models older than the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14, which frustrated Musk.<br/>
<br/>
The series of satellite connectivity spats added to animosity between Musk and Apple, who have also grappled with disagreements over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> fees. In recent years, Musk has plotted the idea of building his own phone to get around Apple's "gatekeeper" position in the market. Musk has reportedly discussed Tesla building the phone and satellite connectivity being provided by Starlink.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emergency-sos-via-satellite/">Emergency SOS via Satellite</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-satellite-features/">iPhone Satellite Features</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/elon-musk-battled-apple-over-satellite-features/">Elon Musk Battled Apple Over Satellite Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/elon-musk-battled-apple-over-satellite-features.2457765/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; support comes more than 15 years after the messaging service launched. In September, Meta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/whatsapp-beta-native-ipad-support/">started beta testing</a> WhatsApp for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; via TestFlight.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp allows users of the encrypted messaging platform to link up to four devices to their account even when their main smartphone is not connected to the internet. Each linked device connects to WhatsApp independently, ensuring that personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end encrypted.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to WhatsApp, Meta owns Facebook, Threads, and Instagram. There is an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app for Facebook, but the Threads app remains <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> only. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/instagram-ipad-app/">Instagram app for the iPad</a> is reportedly in the works.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997">available to download from the App Store</a> now.<br/>
