		<description><![CDATA[Apple is now accepting pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max through <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/">its online storefront</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948">Apple Store app</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> app is typically the quickest way to get a pre-order in as it is often accessible before the website comes up.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-and-15-Pro-Pre-Orders-Live-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911294" /><br/>
Pre-orders are being accepted in more than 40 countries and regions around the world, and those who used Apple's "Get Ready" feature should be able to hit a button to get their orders in without hassle.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; starts at &#36;799 or &#36;33.29 per month in the United States, while pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus starts at &#36;899 or &#36;37.45 per month. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; is available starting at &#36;999 or &#36;41.62 per month, and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is available starting at &#36;1,199 or &#36;49.95 per month. Pricing will vary depending on country.<br/>
<br/>
The lowest-priced &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, 15 Plus, and 15 Pro Max models have 128GB of storage, but the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max starts with 256GB of storage. Storage upgrades are available for an increased price, with up to 1TB of storage available. Apple is encouraging customers to use trade-in credits to lower the price of the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, and it is also <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/carrier-offers">promoting carrier deals</a> from AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
All of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are equipped with USB-C ports, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a new Ultra Wideband chip, Qualcomm 5G modems, and a range of camera updates. The more affordable &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus have an A16 chip, an aluminum frame, and a frosted glass back, as well as a new 48-megapixel Main camera. There have been updates to Portrait mode, Night mode, and general improvements to image quality thanks to Smart HDR updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Colors.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910250" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models feature a new titanium frame that makes them much lighter than prior-generation models, with titanium also offering increased strength and durability. Apple replaced the mute switch with an Action button that can be customized with a number of functions, and display bezels have been slimmed down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911148" /><br/>
Pro models are also equipped with a faster A17 Pro chip with major GPU improvements that enable them to play console-level games, and they feature all of the camera improvements from the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, plus more.<br/>
<br/>
Both models have improved Ultra Wide cameras, and while the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; still has a 3x Telephoto lens, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max has a new tetraprism mechanism for its Telephoto lens, enabling 5x optical zoom.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-blue-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911150" /><br/>
It's not yet clear on whether there will be shortages of the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, but it is a good idea to pre-order right away just in case. There were rumors of production difficulties with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, so it is possible it will sell out. The 5x zoom lens, the new titanium material, and the A17 Pro chip make it especially enticing.<br/>
<br/>

U.S. carriers like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are accepting preorders for the new devices, as are other carriers worldwide. Big box retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart have pre-orders available too.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who pre-order one of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models can expect to begin receiving their deliveries on Friday, September 22, the official launch date for the new devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-preorders-now-available/">iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Models Now Available for Pre-Order</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-models-now-available-for-pre-order.2401920/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple does not advertise battery capacities for its new iPhone 15 lineup, but <em><a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/apple-iphone-15-series-battery-capacity-wattage-support-revealed-by-chinese-regulatory-database/">MySmartPrice</a></em> has obtained this information from a Chinese regulatory database.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-lineup-store.jpg" alt="" width="2976" height="1538" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911377" /><br/>
The Chinese regulatory listing reveals that the iPhone 15 has a 3,349mAh battery (rated capacity) and a wattage of 12.981Wh, while the iPhone 15 Pro has a 3,274mAh battery and a wattage of 12.70Wh.<br/>
<br/>
Battery capacities for the full iPhone 15 lineup:<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 15: 3,349mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Plus: 4,383mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro: 3,274mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 4,422mAh</li></ul><br/>
Battery capacities for the 2022 iPhone 14 lineup:<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 14: 3,279 mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro: 3,200 mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro Max: 4,323 mAh</li></ul><br/>
The same database accurately revealed battery capacities for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/11/iphone-14-battery-capacities-mah/">all four iPhone 14 models</a> ahead of those devices launching last year. <br/>
<br/>
Apple did not highlight any battery life improvements for its new iPhone 15 models compared to their direct predecessors. This comes contrary to a multitude of rumors prior to Apple's event, which suggested that the major efficiency improvements of the A17 Pro chip would bring battery life improvements.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, the approximate battery life of each of iPhone 15 model is as follows:<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 15: 20 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Plus: 26 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro: 23 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 29 hours</li><br/>
</ul>This is exactly the same as the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro Max, and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Of course, efficiency improvements may still result in slightly better real-world performance in Apple's latest models. <br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models were announced by Apple earlier this week and will be available to pre-order on Friday. The devices are set to launch on September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-battery-capacities-revealed/">iPhone 15 Battery Capacities Revealed in Regulatory Database</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-battery-capacities-revealed-in-regulatory-database.2401911/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple to Issue iPhone 12 Software Update in France to Address Radiation Concerns</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple said on Friday it would issue a software update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> users in France to address <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/france-orders-end-to-iphone-12-sales-radiation/">radiation concerns</a> raised by the country's regulators (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-implement-iphone-12-update-next-few-days-france-minister-2023-09-15/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iphone-12-preorder-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1213" height="682" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-794852" /><blockquote>"We will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators. We look forward to iPhone 12 continuing to be available in France," Apple said in a statement.<br/>
<br/>
"This is related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators and not a safety concern," added the company.</blockquote>The French regulator ANFR said it would test the software update. If it made a difference to the electromagnetic waves the device emitted, the regulator said it would bring the model into compliance with European standards applied in France, and the marketing withdrawal order would be lifted.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, France <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/france-orders-end-to-iphone-12-sales-radiation/">ordered</a> Apple to halt &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; sales and "fix" existing devices to bring them into electromagnetic radiation compliance with European standards. The increase in emitted electromagnetic radiation observed over time by regulators appears to have been the result of successive software updates issued by Apple, and was not present when the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; was launched in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
The ANFR ordered Apple to "remove the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌ from the French market from September 12 due to the model exceeding the limit" for electromagnetic absorption by the body. The agency also told Apple to recall every ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌ it has ever sold in the country. Ministers later said that though the radiation level was above the accepted standard, it was not dangerous and people were safe to continue using the phones, local media reported. <br/>
<br/>
Following the controversy, Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-14/apple-tech-support-staff-urged-to-stay-mum-on-iphone-12-radiation-issue">reportedly</a> advised its tech-support staff not to volunteer any information when consumers ask about the issue, and tell any concerned customers that that all Apple products go through rigorous testing to ensure that they're safe, according to guidance.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/france/">France</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-iphone-12-software-update-france-radiation/">Apple to Issue iPhone 12 Software Update in France to Address Radiation Concerns</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-issue-iphone-12-software-update-in-france-to-address-radiation-concerns.2401857/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_JEezynhrc">shared an ad</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, exclusively highlighting the new titanium finish of the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_JEezynhrc?si=Umn0q-DK-7Tep0T-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The 38-second spot depicts a titanium fragment exploding into view and torpedoing through the Solar System towards the surface of the Earth. "From the edge of the universe... to the palm of your hand," reads the ad's tagline.<br/>
<blockquote>Might meets light. Introducing the new titanium iPhone 15 Pro. Featuring a whole new level of gaming performance with the A17 Pro chip. A more versatile, more advanced Pro camera system. And an aerospace-grade titanium design. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are our lightest, most powerful Pro models ever.</blockquote>For the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max, Apple is using a new titanium frame rather than a stainless steel frame, which cuts down on weight. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max, yet the chassis is more durable.<br/>
<br/>
The use of titanium on the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ also brings with it a change to the chassis finish. Previously, all Pro iPhones used heavily polished stainless steel with a mirror finish as the chassis material. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ has a brushed finish that is considerably less reflective than the finish of previous Pro iPhones, and is also less prone to fingerprints.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;‌ Plus continue to feature a chassis made from aluminum. Pre-orders for all &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models begin on Friday, September 15, with in-store availability beginning a week later on September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ads/">Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-showcases-iphone-15-pros-titanium-ad/">Apple Showcases iPhone 15 Pro&#039;s Titanium Chassis in New Ad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-showcases-iphone-15-pros-titanium-chassis-in-new-ad.2401845/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
Customers in the United States <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pre-order-setup/">can still "Get Ready"</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; launch with a pre-order setup process that allows them to select an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, confirm it with a carrier, and enter a payment method and shipping address.<br/>
<br/>
Those hoping to get a device on launch day should pre-order right away, as we do not yet know what the available supplies will look like. Popular &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models often sell out quickly, so we could see the new colors disappear within a matter of minutes to hours.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models starts at &#36;799, while pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models starts at &#36;999. Many U.S. carriers are offering discounts, and Apple is offering the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Upgrade Program and trade-in options to drop the price.<br/>
<br/>
After pre-orders on September 15, the first &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; orders will arrive to customers on Friday, September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/iphone-15-preorder-times/">Here&#039;s When You Can Pre-Order the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max in Every Time Zone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-when-you-can-pre-order-the-iphone-15-iphone-15-plus-iphone-15-pro-and-iphone-15-pro-max-in-every-time-zone.2401798/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/apple-releases-ios-16-6-1/">launch of iOS 16.6.1</a> on September 7, Apple has stopped signing iOS 16.6, the previously available version of iOS. Now that iOS 16.6 is no longer being signed, it is not possible to downgrade to that version of iOS after upgrading to iOS 16.6.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iOS-16.6-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892299" /><br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases come out to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date, so it is not unusual that the iOS 16.6 update is no longer being signed.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 16.6.1 is an update that addresses a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/ios-16-6-1-macos-13-5-2-active-vulnerabilities/">zero-day security vulnerability</a> that Apple says was actively exploited in the wild.

		<description><![CDATA[Blackmagic Design today <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagiccamera">announced the launch of Blackmagic Camera</a>, a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> app that integrates with Blackmagic Cloud and uploads content directly to the DaVinci Resolve video editing app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/blackmagic-camera-ios.jpg" alt="" width="2007" height="1129" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911286" /><br/>
The app features the same digital film camera controls and image processing functions that are available with Blackmagic Design's cameras. The company says that users can create YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram content with a "Hollywood" cinematic look and feel.<br/>
<br/>
All settings are adjustable, including frame rate, shutter angle, audio levels, tint, shutter speed, lens, white balance, and ISO, with a simple tap-based interface. The interface includes record parameters, histogram, focus peaking, levels, and frame guides, and it can be brought up with a swipe. Focusing can be done by tapping on the screen, and there are options for shooting in 16:9 or vertical aspect ratios.<br/>
<br/>
4K ProRes video can be recorded directly to Blackmagic Cloud and synced directly into DaVinci Resolve. Cloud integration allows video footage to be sent to a post production studio in a matter of minutes for simpler editing, and it is available to all members of a project.<br/>
<br/>
Video can also be recorded to the phone's storage and then exported to an external drive for those who prefer not to use Blackmagic Cloud, or uploaded manually to Blackmagic Cloud. Footage from multiple iPhones can be sent to DaVinci Resolve and lined up using the software's Sync Bin tool.<br/>
<br/>
More information on the Blackmagic Camera app for iOS can be <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagiccamera">found on the Blackmagic website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Blackmagic Camera is free to use and can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> as of today. [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241">Direct Link</a>]<br/>

		<title>Apple Watch Blood Glucose Team Gains New Lead</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has done some internal shuffling and appointed Tim Millet, vice president of platform architecture, to lead the team that is working on blood glucose monitoring functionality for the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/Apple-Watch-Blood-Glucose-Monitoring-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-888310" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-14/apple-taps-new-chief-for-team-developing-watch-s-glucose-tracker">Bloomberg</a></em>, Millet is now in charge of the Exploratory Design Group or XDG that has been developing noninvasive blood glucose testing for years. The team was previously led by longtime Apple employee Bill Athas, but he unexpectedly died in late 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Millet has been at Apple for almost 20 years, and he reports to Apple chip chief Johny Srouji. <em>Bloomberg</em> says that Millet has played a key role in the transition to Apple silicon, leading several teams that work on the processors.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's work on blood glucose monitoring is being overseen by the semiconductor team rather than a health team because it requires advanced sensors and chips. Apple is exploring a noninvasive monitoring technique that involves shooting a laser underneath the skin to determine the concentration of glucose in the blood.<br/>
<br/>
Noninvasive blood glucose monitoring would allow diabetics to test their blood glucose levels without needing to prick the skin, plus it would likely be able to detect pre-diabetes and other blood glucose issues.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Apple reached a milestone "proof-of-concept" stage with hardware that is about the size of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but Apple needs to condense the components into a size that can fit into an Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will begin accepting pre-orders for the new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max this Friday, September 15 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time. As usual, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-pro/">Pro models</a> have a long list of new features, including a USB-C port, lightweight titanium frame, customizable Action button, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Below, we have highlighted 12 new features on the iPhone 15 Pro models:<br/>
<ul><li>Lightning has been replaced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-pro/">with a <strong>USB-C port</strong></a> for a more universal charging standard and faster data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps.</li><br/>
<li>All four iPhone 15 models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/all-iphone-15-models-support-displayport/"><strong>support DisplayPort</strong></a> for up to 4K HDR video mirroring and video output to an external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable, according to Apple's tech specs for the devices.</li><br/>
<li>A new <strong>titanium frame</strong> results in the iPhone 15 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/titanium-iphone-15-pro-weight/">weighing up to 10% less</a> than the iPhone 14 Pro models with a stainless steel frame.</li><br/>
<li>A customizable <strong>Action button</strong> replaces the traditional mute switch on previous iPhones. By default, the button is set to toggle between Ring and Silent modes, but it can also be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-action-button-everything-it-can-do/">assigned to a different action</a> for quick access to the camera, flashlight, Voice Memos, Shortcuts, Focus modes, and more.</li><br/>
<li>The new <strong>A17 Pro chip</strong> enables <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/iphone-15-pro-geekbench-scores/">up to 10% faster CPU performance</a> and up to 20% faster GPU performance compared to the A16 Bionic chip.</li><br/>
<li>The devices are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/iphone-15-pro-features-specs-rumors/">equipped with <strong>8GB of RAM</strong></a>, up from 6GB in the iPhone 14 Pro models. Along with the new A17 Pro chip, extra RAM benefits overall system performance, particularly for multitasking.</li><br/>
<li>There are <strong>thinner bezels</strong> around the screen compared to the iPhone 14 Pro models.</li><br/>
<li>Like the latest Macs and iPad Pro, the iPhone 15 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-models-wi-fi-6e/">support <strong>Wi-Fi 6E</strong></a> (6GHz) for faster wireless speeds and less signal interference. Remember, you'll need a Wi-Fi 6E router in order to take advantage of this functionality.</li><br/>
<li>The iPhone 15 Pro Max exclusively features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/"><strong>up to 5x optical zoom</strong></a>.</li><br/>
<li>The devices are equipped with a <strong>second-generation Ultra Wideband chip</strong>. Apple says two iPhones with this chip can connect from 3x farther away.</li><br/>
<li>The devices feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/iphone-15-pro-models-more-repairable/"><strong>more repairable internal design</strong></a>, with a redesigned frame that allows for the back glass panel to be easily removed from the devices. This change was first made to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus last year.</li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/new-iphone-15-pro-color-options-no-gold/"><strong>New colors</strong></a>: Natural Titanium, Blue Titanium, White Titanium, and Black Titanium.</li></ul>For more details about the devices, read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro roundup</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/iphone-15-pro-pre-orders-tomorrow/">iPhone 15 Pro Available to Order Tomorrow With These 12 New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-available-to-order-tomorrow-with-these-12-new-features.2401761/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The earbuds are &#36;19 on Apple's online store.<br/>
<br/>

Apple now sells three versions of EarPods, including ones with a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTJY3AM/A/earpods-usb-c">USB-C connector</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-lightning-connector">Lightning connector</a>, and a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-35mm-headphone-plug">3.5mm headphone plug</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Released in 2012, the EarPods have become far less popular since Apple launched wireless AirPods in 2016. Starting with the iPhone 12 series in 2020, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/iphone-12-ships-without-earpods-or-charger/">stopped including EarPods</a> and a charger in the box with new iPhones in order to be more environmentally friendly, a decision that was controversial at the time.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset is not launching until early 2024, some developers have access to the device in order to develop <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> apps. Though Feedback Assistant, Apple is collecting opinions on the Vision Pro "Persona" that is created for each person for use with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-facetime.jpg" alt="" width="2432" height="1368" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900260" /><br/>
The Persona is a digital representation of the user, with Apple using the headset's cameras to recreate the face and hands. While the &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; call is ongoing, the Persona is able to make the same facial expressions and hand movements as the user, so that &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; calls feel more like a person-to-person interaction.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/vision-pro-headset-survey.jpg" alt="" width="1074" height="1388" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911183" /><br/>
There is likely some degree of uncanny valley with this experience, so it is no surprise that it is a feature that Apple is working to refine. Apple is asking developers a number of questions about the Persona experience.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>How do you feel about your Persona?</li><br/>
 	<li>To what extent do you feel this Persona represents your appearance?</li><br/>
 	<li>To what extent do you feel your Persona responds to your facial expressions?</li><br/>
 	<li>What do you like most about your Persona?</li><br/>
 	<li>What do you like least about your Persona?</li><br/>
 	<li>What do you like/not like about this Persona?</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Respondents are given multiple choice answers for most of the questions, with the last one being an open feedback form. For the "How do you feel about your Persona?" question, for example, responses include "Very Happy - I'm excited to use it," "Happy - I would be okay using it," "Unhappy - I would be hesitant to use it," and "Very Unhappy - I would never use it."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: Apple is asking developers with the Vision Pro to fill out a feedback survey about FaceTime Personas.<br><br>Some questions include: <br><br>How do you feel about your Persona?<br><br>To what extent do you feel this Persona represents your appearance? <a href="https://t.co/wKgQlKrODL">pic.twitter.com/wKgQlKrODL</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1702364571053248573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple does not plan to release the Vision Pro headset until early 2024, so it still has several months of software refining and hardware tweaking to do before the device needs to be mass produced in order to sell.<br/>
<br/>
The headset will be priced at &#36;3,500 when it launches, and it will first be available in the United States before expanding to other countries.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/apple-vision-pro-developer-survey/">Apple Surveys Devs With Vision Pro About Digital &#039;Persona&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-surveys-devs-with-vision-pro-about-digital-persona.2401745/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple has made sharing files and media easier than ever, thanks to a cool new AirDrop proximity feature that does most of the work for you. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airdrop-videos-ios-17.jpg" alt="" width="2484" height="1391" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900711" /><br/>
In prior versions of iOS, transferring a file or photo between Apple devices involves opening the file in question, tapping the Share button, selecting AirDrop, then choosing the nearby device you want to send the file to.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, this procedure still exists for sharing between Apple devices, but if you're transferring between iPhones or iPads then you can cut out some of the typical sharing steps by using AirDrop's new proximity feature.<br/>
<br/>
To initiate a transfer, select the photo or file that you want to share with someone. From there, simply bring your unlocked ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>‌ (or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>) next to the other person's unlocked ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and your device will pop up a share interface without you having to tap on the Share Sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Tap the Share button that pops up to send the photo or file to the person next to you, and it will be received on the other device automatically, with permission granted through their proximity.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airdrop-proximity-sharing.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1327" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905665" /><br/>
<br/>
Note that sharing files this way works even if AirDrop receiving is turned off or limited to contacts, so it offers a way to share a file with someone without having to change your overall AirDrop settings. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Enable or Disable AirDrop Proximity Sharing</h3><br/>
 We're used to AirDrop working with someone in the same room and involving a few manual steps, but the proximity sharing feature makes transfers between two devices virtually effortless. Of course, if you don't like the idea of proximity sharing, you can turn it off. Here's how it's done in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 17&zwnj;.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>Tap through to <strong>General -> AirDrop</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle the switch next to <strong>Bringing Devices Together </strong>on or off.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/enable-disable-airdrop-proximity-sharing.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911172" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. Note that disabling this setting will also prevent the sharing of contacts via NameDrop. To learn about how contact sharing has also become easier than ever in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, check out our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-share-contact-details-with-namedrop/">dedicated NameDrop how-to</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airdrop/">AirDrop</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-share-files-media-airdrop-proximity/">iOS 17: How to Send Files and Photos With AirDrop Proximity Sharing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-how-to-send-files-and-photos-with-airdrop-proximity-sharing.2401729/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> replaces the first-generation model that was introduced last year in Apple's smartwatch lineup, but how different are the two successive smartwatch generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-vs-Ultra-2-Buyers-Guide.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911116" /><br/>
In 2023, Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Ultra, introducing a more durable design and titanium casing, a larger and brighter display, additional speakers and microphones, considerably longer battery life, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-8-vs-apple-watch-ultra/">more</a>. The first-generation Apple Watch Ultra has now been discontinued by Apple, and as a year-old model, prices at third-party resellers are falling. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to upgrade to a first- or second-generation Ultra‌.<br/>
<br/>
The two Apple Watch Ultra models share the overwhelming majority of their features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the first-generation to save money? This breakdown also serves as a way to see all the differences that the Ultra 2 brings to the table.<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>

 <tr><br/>
 <td>32GB storage</td><br/>
 <td>64GB storage</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 </table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Overall, the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; is a very minor upgrade over the first-generation model, with the S9 chip, Double Tap, and Precision Finding for &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models being the most significant changes. As a result, it is very difficult to recommend upgrading.<br/>
<br/>
Most users of the existing Apple Watch Ultra will not be able to justify upgrading to the Ultra 2, but some customers coming from an older Apple Watch or those who do not have one at all could still have good reason to prefer the latest model, namely those who heavily use a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, plan to buy an &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model and can take advantage of Precision Finding, need additional storage for downloaded media, or think one-handed use with the Double Tap gesture would be useful.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; is very similar to the first-generation model, so most customers who are interested in buying an Ultra model may prefer to look for a discounted first-generation model. If the original device can be found for a substantially lower price, it remains a solid buy. The Ultra 2 is priced at &#36;799, so if you are not interested in its new features and can find the original model for less than ~&#36;650, it may be worth getting that instead.<div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-ultra-vs-ultra-2/">Apple Watch Ultra vs. Ultra 2 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 12 Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-vs-ultra-2-buyers-guide-12-differences-compared.2401719/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">announcement</a> of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro at this week's "Wonderlust" event, carrier discounts and offers have quickly emerged for the latest generation of iPhone.

<br/>
Like years past, most of the carriers are all offering similar discounts. Apple even mentioned these sales during its keynote, stating it was working with multiple carriers to offer customers as much as &#36;1,000 off the new iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[As widely expected, all four iPhone 15 models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-and-15-plus/">equipped with a USB-C port</a> instead of a Lightning port. Apple also made the AirPods Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/">available with a USB-C charging case</a>, and released wired EarPods with a USB-C connector.<br/>
<br/>

Nevertheless, there are a handful of Apple devices and accessories that are still sold with Lightning, which debuted on the iPhone 5 back in 2012:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone SE</li><br/>
<li>Ninth-generation iPad</li><br/>
<li>Second-generation and third-generation AirPods</li><br/>
<li>AirPods Max</li><br/>
<li>First-generation Apple Pencil</li><br/>
<li>Magic Keyboard (Mac version)</li><br/>
<li>Magic Mouse</li><br/>
<li>Magic Trackpad</li><br/>
<li>Various cables and adapters</li></ul>Apple did <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">discontinue its MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Charger</a> accessories with Lightning following the iPhone 15 event.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these products will likely be updated with USB-C in the future, such as the AirPods Max and the trio of Magic accessories for the Mac, while previous-generation products in the list like the older iPhones, iPad, and Apple Pencil will eventually be discontinued. Until then, the Lightning era of Apple is not completely over.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lightning/">Lightning</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/remaining-apple-products-with-lightning/">These Apple Products Are Still Sold With Lightning Following iPhone 15&#039;s Switch to USB-C</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-apple-products-are-still-sold-with-lightning-following-iphone-15s-switch-to-usb-c.2401711/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you ever been into an Apple Store to purchase something small, like a new iPhone case or Apple Watch band, but passed by that colorful iMac or pixel-perfect Studio Display along the way and just couldn't resist buying one?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/imac-2021-box-feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2566" height="1443" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-799803" /><br/>
For those spur-of-the-moment purchases, Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-offers-more-ways-to-order-the-all-new-iphone-15-and-apple-watch-lineups/">announced</a> a new solution called Easy Pay Online Ordering that gives customers the option to have the products they purchase in store delivered to their home. Apple said its retail stores are also now able to sell out-of-stock items to customers that are delivered to their home at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
This new option means that customers will no longer have to drag heavy, large-boxed products to their vehicle in the parking lot or on public transportation. Alternatively, ordering via Apple's online store remains an option to avoid this dilemma as well.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's plans to offer Easy Pay Online Ordering were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-retail-stores-home-delivery-option/">reported by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> in July, and the company officially announced the feature today.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/apple-store-delivery-option/">Buy a Large Product at an Apple Store?

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus are Apple's latest standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, sporting some bigger upgrades than seen in recent years, but how different really are the two successive &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-14-vs-15-Buyers-Guide.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910683" /><br/>
In 2022, Apple unveiled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> as the successor to the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, offering 2GB more memory, longer battery life, the Photonic Engine, Action mode, Emergency SOS via satellite, Crash Detection, and more. As devices that are more affordable than the "Pro" models, but more full-featured than the low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus will likely be the most popular option for many customers, starting at a price of &#36;799 for the 128GB model. The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus continue to be available from Apple for &#36;699 and &#36;799, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
As the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; share the overwhelming majority of their features, should you consider buying or sticking with the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; to save money? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models is best for you, and serves as a way to clearly see the differences that the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; brings to the table. This article focuses on the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, Apple's standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, but to understand the differences between the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, see our other buyer's guide:<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; both feature the same display sizes, battery life, 12-megapixel ultra wide camera, and more. Nevertheless, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; still offers a number of substantial upgrades, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, USB-C port, and 48-megapixel camera.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;'s upgrades over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; are fairly substantial, offering a more refined and appealing design with contoured edges, frosted back glass, and the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;. Features like the brighter display and USB-C port are meaningful quality-of-life enhancements that all users will be able to take advantage of. The 48-megapixel main camera, 2x optical zoom option, next-generation portraits, Smart HDR 5, and improved Night mode also make for a significant overall camera improvement for average users. Iterative changes like the A16 Bionic and support for Qi2 are also welcome refinements.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on what sort of user you are, it may not be worth upgrading from an &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; model to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; unless you actively want several of the new features, but the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus seem to be an unusually large upgrade for Apple's non-Pro iPhones. As a result, a large number of users with one of these older devices may be able to justify upgrading to an &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model. Those with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 or older will definitely receive a major upgrade by purchasing an &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
For everyday users, it is worth noting that the switch to USB-C on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; will make any Lightning cables and accessories you have redundant, meaning you'll need to purchase a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-usb-c-lightning-adapter-and-more/">&#36;29 adapter</a> or use a new cable. If you're coming from a much older device, you will also likely need to buy a new power adapter. If you are unhappy about this change, then it may be worth sticking with what you have for another year, but it is worth highlighting that the switch to USB-C is beneficial in the long term since it is a standard port used across a wide range of devices.<br/>
<br/>
Since the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; is a mostly noteworthy upgrade, it is generally not worth buying an &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; model instead, unless it can be found for a significantly lower price. The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus are only a year old and still very good devices, but the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; has a range of improvements that are likely to make it age better and be slightly more useful over time, which warrants its higher price.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14">iPhone 14 (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-vs-iphone-15/">iPhone 14 vs. iPhone 15 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 20 Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-vs-iphone-15-buyers-guide-20-upgrades-compared.2401686/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-apple-watch-ultra-2/">all-new Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> is available to order in the U.S. and more than 40 other countries, with pricing set at &#36;799. The high-end Apple Watch will launch in stores and begin arriving to customers on September 22, but some configurations are already facing lengthy shipping delays as of late Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>

A quick spot check of Apple's online store in the U.S. reveals that models with an Alpine band in Blue in Medium/Large sizes face 2-3 week shipping estimates for orders placed on late Wednesday, while models with the Trail Loop in Orange and Beige   for both S/M and M/L sizes face an even lengthier 6-7 week delay at this time. That said, there are still at least a half-dozen band options available with September 22 launch day delivery overall.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation Apple Watch Ultra offers all of the features of the original Ultra, plus a faster new S9 SiP chip, a new double tap gesture, Apple's brightest display ever, expanded altitude range, quicker on-device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, Precision Finding for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, and new capabilities for water adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch Ultra is advertised as having up to 36 hours of battery life per charge during normal usage, and up to 72 hours of normal usage with Low Power Mode enabled – up 12 hours from the previous generation.<div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/apple-watch-ultra-2-shipping-delays/">Apple Watch Ultra 2 Already Facing 6-7 Week Shipping Delay for Some Configurations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-2-already-facing-6-7-week-shipping-delay-for-some-configurations.2401682/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">iPhone 15 event on Tuesday</a>, Apple released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-usb-c-lightning-adapter-and-more/">few related accessories</a>, including a USB-C to Lightning adapter and a one-meter Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable. It turns out the company has also made available a new <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU2G3AM/A/240w-usb-c-charge-cable-2-m?">60W 1-meter USB-C Charge Cable (&#36;19)</a> and a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU2G3AM/A/240w-usb-c-charge-cable-2-m?">240W 2-meter USB-C Charge Cable (&#36;29)</a>, designed for charging iPhone 15 models, iPads, and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/USB-C-60w-240w-charge-cable.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911066" /><br/>
Apple advertises the new woven charge cable with USB-C connectors on both ends as "ideal for charging, syncing, and transferring data between USB-C devices." It supports charging of up to 240 watts and transfers data at USB 2 rates. <br/>
<br/>
Compatible with all iPhone 15 models and Apple's latest iPad and Mac models, the cable can be paired with a compatible USB-C power adapter to charge the devices from a wall outlet and take advantage of fast-charging capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
While the new standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with a USB-C port, data transfer over a cable remains limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps, which is equal to the Lightning port on previous iPhones. <br/>
<br/>
The higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also equipped with a USB-C port, but those devices support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps over a cable. For this reason, Apple made its previously-existing Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable available in a shorter one-meter size for &#36;69. <br/>
