Other news this week included Apple starting to pay out claims for the high-profile class action lawsuit that claimed Apple was "secretly throttling" older iPhones with degraded batteries, an approaching release of iOS 17.3 and related updates, and the annual CES tech event in Las Vegas, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Vision Pro Launches February 2, Pre-Orders Start Next Week</h2><br/>
After being unveiled at WWDC 2023 last June, Apple's long-awaited Vision Pro mixed reality headset <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">now has a release date: Friday, February 2</a>. Pre-orders begin on Friday, January 19 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time. Availability is limited to the U.S., with more countries to follow later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
Pricing starts at &#36;3,499 with 256GB of storage, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/vision-pro-lens-inserts-to-start-at-99/">ZEISS optical inserts will be available for &#36;99 to &#36;149</a>. If you're planning to order, make sure to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/12/apple-vision-pro-preorder-tips/">check out Apple's tips</a> to make sure you're ready.<br/>
<br/>
Apple refers to the Vision Pro as a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/vision-pro-developers-asked-to-avoid-vr-branding/">spatial computer</a>," and it offers a combination of augmented reality and virtual reality features. The headset is powered by an all-new visionOS operating system, which can be controlled with a user's eyes, hands, and voice.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Apple Vision Pro: Here's Everything You Get in the Box</h2><br/>
In its press release announcing the Vision Pro's launch date, Apple revealed the various <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-vision-pro-everything-included-in-box/">items that will be included with the headset</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929939" /><br/>
Apple says the headset will ship with two types of head bands (a Solo Knit Band and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/vision-pro-ships-with-dual-loop-band/">Dual Loop Band</a>), a light seal, two light seal cushions, a cover for the front glass, a polishing cloth, an external battery pack, a USB-C power adapter, and a USB-C charging cable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Vision Pro Features 16GB of RAM</h2><br/>
Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-vision-pro-how-much-ram-and-storage/">equipped with 16GB of unified memory</a>, according to files related to the device in Xcode 15.2.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-chips.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898904" /><br/>
Our finding in Apple's app development tool confirms a June 2023 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/apple-wwdc-2023-mixed-reality-headset-ios-17-and-other-products-to-expect">report from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> that said the Vision Pro would be equipped with 16GB of RAM, and that is also the same amount of memory that was included in Vision Pro development kits.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Sends &#36;92 'Batterygate' Payments to iPhone Users</h2><br/>
Apple in 2020 agreed to pay up to &#36;500 million to settle a class action lawsuit in the U.S. that accused the company of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/">"secretly throttling" some iPhone models</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/06/apple-starts-iphone-batterygate-payouts/">payouts finally started going out this week</a> to individuals who submitted a claim.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-6s-MacRumors-YouTube.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929156" /><br/>
iPhone users have received &#36;92.17 per claim from Apple, according to multiple <em>MacRumors</em> readers. The deadline to submit a claim was in October 2020.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.3 Coming Soon With These Two New Features for Your iPhone</h2><br/>
iOS 17.3 has been in beta testing since mid-December, and the upcoming software update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/ios-17-3-coming-soon/">includes two new features for the iPhone</a>, including Stolen Device Protection and collaborative Apple Music playlists.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" /><br/>

<br/>
Apple seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-releases-ios-17-3-beta-3-to-developers/">third beta of iOS 17.3</a> this week, and the update will likely be widely released later this month.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> prototypes seen by <em>MacRumors</em> indicate that Apple has again tweaked the design of the Action button, and now it looks much like the Action button found on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. Apple has been toying with the size and design of the Action button for the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;, but in the latest "Proto2" development stage, the company is sticking with a tried and true design.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Left-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928696" /><br/>
During the different &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; development stages, Apple has tested four button configurations and two sizes for the Action button.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Unified volume button with small Action button</li><br/>
<li>Unified volume button with large Action button and new Capture button</li><br/>
<li>Separate volume buttons with large Action button and Capture button flush with frame</li><br/>
<li>Separate volume buttons with small Action button and Capture button flush with frame (current)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The earliest known prototypes of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; had a unified volume button and small multi-purpose Action button, both on the left side, with a power button on the right. This design was initially developed as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-haptic-button-overview/">Project Bongo</a>, which was an attempt to bring haptic buttons the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. While the project was ultimately canceled due to unsatisfactory test results and high hardware failure rates, parts of the Bongo design, namely the unified volume button, found their way onto early designs of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The second prototype variant of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; also used a unified volume button, but it had a larger Action button that was close in size to the volume buttons. This prototype also had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">an additional "Capture button"</a> on the right side below the power button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913688" /><br/>
Later prototypes (pictured above) featured separate volume buttons rather than the unified button design. With these more recent units, Apple planned to include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">capacitive Action button</a> and Capture button, both of which were flush with the frame and featured force sensor technology.<br/>
<br/>
With the most recent "Proto2" design, Apple has once again changed the Action button. Apple has now adopted a smaller Action button that mirrors the Action button on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, doing away with the larger, flush look. While it is currently unclear how this affects the future of Apple's work on a capacitive Action button, a design change as significant as this indicates it has been canceled or postponed for future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> iterations.<br/>
<br/>
Although the information presented here accurately describes existing internal designs, it is important to note that additional design changes are always possible, and the information presented here may not reflect finalized design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Hundreds of companies are at CES in Las Vegas this week showing off new products, and <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera has been spending time on the show floor to check out what's new, exciting, and worth taking note of.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZuzgBud-TPo" title="CES 2024 Day 3: Clicks iPhone Keyboard, Qi2 Chargers, AR Glasses and More" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
We wrote about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/clicks-iphone-keyboard/">the Clicks physical keyboard</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> last week, but Dan was able to test it out in person and he said that the keys feel great under the fingers and those who want a tactile typing experience will like it. The case is easy to put on and take off the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and there are handy shortcut keys for Spotlight search, webpage scrolling, and getting back to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Withings was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/ces-2024-withings-beamo/">demoing the BeamO</a>, an all-in-one device that can take your temperature, capture an ECG, monitor blood oxygen, and even serve as a digital stethoscope, and there were Qi2 chargers galore from brands like Hyper, Anker, and ESR. Qi2 is the latest charging technology, and it's bringing more affordable 15W wireless charging to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Targus was showing off an ambidextrous mouse that can be used by both right and left-handed people, and the company also had a dock that can connect two laptops together with three monitors, serving as a KVM.<br/>
<br/>
Sony and Honda had the Afeela electric car on the show floor with its dozens of sensors for driver safety, and Dan also took note of the Barsys 360, a smart cocktail machine that mixes and pours bartender-grade drinks.<br/>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, there were a <em>ton</em> of AR/VR devices, some of which seemed to be inspired by the Vision Pro. One standout was the <a href="https://www.xreal.com">XREAL AR Glasses</a>, but they're only compatible with Samsung's latest smartphones.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[When the holiday festivities are done with and January rolls around, people naturally look to improving their health and usually turn to smart devices to get their lifestyle back on track. Weight loss is typically part of that calculation, and while smart scales can help, there's little to distinguish between the majority of offerings on the market. <br/>
<br/>
Weight and body composition analysis have become <em>de rigueur</em> features these days, but Withings' <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-scan">Body Scan Connected Health Station</a> aims to go above and beyond the competition by offering an almost dizzying array of information about your physiological makeup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/withings-body-scan.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930339" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Features</h2><br/>
At &#36;400 in the U.S. and £350 in the U.K., the Withings Body Scan is definitely at the higher end of the market for a smart scale. But when you consider its comprehensive set of body measurements, the price is a little easier to swallow. Biometrics include:<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>Weight</li><br/>
  <li>Metabolic Age</li><br/>
<li>Basal Metabolic Rate</li><br/>
  <li>BMI</li><br/>
  <li>Segmental body composition analysis including:<br/>
    <ul><br/>
      <li>Muscle Mass (across five zones)</li><br/>
      <li>Fat Mass (across five zones)</li><br/>
      <li>Bone Mass</li><br/>
      <li>Visceral Fat Index</li><br/>
      <li>Lean Mass</li><br/>
      <li>Water Mass</li><br/>
    </ul><br/>
  </li><br/>
  <li>Nerve health</li><br/>
  <li>Pulse Wave Velocity</li><br/>
  <li>ECG</li><br/>
 <li>Vascular Age</li><br/>
  <li>Heart Rate</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Connecting via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, the scale feeds all of this information into the Withings Health Mate app, which connects to Apple Health or Google Fit to provide a comprehensive hub for pretty much everything to do with your body (more on this later). <br/>
<br/>
While the scale measures weight to 0.11 pounds (50g) precision and provides several insightful metrics not seen on other scales, its standout feature is the segmental body composition analysis. This is made possible by a retractable handle that has a series of metal plates on it. When standing on the scale and with the handle held in both hands, the device sends an imperceptible electrical current through your body and analyzes the fat and muscle mass for your torso, arms, and legs independently. The idea here is to spot fat and muscle imbalances so that you can target your efforts on the specific areas of your body that need more work. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/withings-body-scan-packaging.jpg" alt="" width="3992" height="2887" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930389" /><br/>
A similar technique is also used to measure arterial stiffness, by tracking how long it takes for a wave created in the blood as the heart beats to arrive at the foot — a measure Withings calls Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV). The retractable handle also features a 6-lead ECG that, like Apple Watch, can detect AFib, the most common cardiac rhythm disturbance that can cause stroke and heart failure.  <br/>
<br/>
Due to differing clinical regulatory hurdles based on region, there are also a couple of differences between the Body Scan that's sold in the United States and models available in the EU.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. version includes an Electrodermal Activity (EDA) Score. This biomarker measures and assesses the activity of the sweat glands in the soles of your feet. According to Withings, the EDA score can provide care teams with insight into a patient's stress levels, diet, and overall health. Meanwhile, the EU version tracks nerve health by providing a Nerve Health Score, which can help to detect signs of peripheral autonomic neuropathies, a damage in small nerves, one of the most prevalent complications of diabetes, and other common chronic conditions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design and Performance</h2><br/>
The Body Scan's design is robust and visually inoffensive, combining a sleek striped tempered glass surface with a durable plastic base. However, measuring approximately 12.5 x 14 inches, it's larger and quite a bit heavier than most smart scales. It also lacks non-slip feet on the base, so it's probably not suited to super-smooth flooring. The scale interface also includes a large, vibrant color display that's easy to read from standing height. <br/>
<br/>
The initial setup process of the Body Scan is user-friendly and intuitive enough. After charging the scale via the supplied USB-C cable and downloading the Withings Health Mate app to your phone, pairing the scale is generally straightforward, although this can be subject to the usual challenges of Wi-Fi connectivity, such as signal strength and interference, so make sure you have coverage in your bathroom or wherever you plan to keep it. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/withings-body-scan-scale.jpg" alt="" width="1336" height="852" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930373" /><br/>
To get a Body Scan, you need to stand on the scale barefoot and grip the handle with both hands. This allows the scale to conduct its comprehensive health check, but the duration for a complete scan is around one and a half minutes, so there's some waiting around. If you step off early, you'll still get your weight and some of the other standard biometrics, but things like Pulse Velocity and the segmental body composition analysis will usually fail. Fortunately, the app lets you customize which health metrics are recorded and displayed on the scale's screen, so you can tailor the experience to your own needs.<br/>
<br/>
The scale can support up to eight individual user profiles, making it suitable for family use. However, its user recognition system is not foolproof and may occasionally misidentify the user standing on it, especially if two people in your household have a similar weight. Fortunately, the scale includes a neat solution that usually works – if it's not sure who you are, it will show you each family member's profile as a list, which you can scroll through by balancing on the foot of the direction you wish to scroll.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/withings-body-scan-handle.jpg" alt="" width="1336" height="852" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930374" /><br/>
There are a few other notable features that may be appealing to different members of a household. An eyes-closed mode hides the numbers from the scale screen at weigh-ins, offering motivational messages instead, while a baby mode will give you an accurate weight of your child just by holding them in your arms and stepping on the scale. There's also a pregnancy mode and an athletic mode for tracking health with different measurement algorithms.<br/>
<br/>
All of this is customizable within the app, which is generally well designed and intuitive. It includes a visual 3D map of your segmented body composition (which tells you whether you are in or outside a normal range versus other users like you), trending graphs for several metrics like weight and BMI, and actionable health insights based on your weekly and monthly trends. It also allows you to export a health report PDF for a healthcare specialist or personal trainer. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/withings-mate-app.jpg" alt="" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930380" /><br/>
The app is definitely aiming to be more than just a scale accompaniment, and will also track your physical activity and sleep. It also suggests long-term goals, challenges, and reminders for continuing healthy habits. The optional Withings+ subscription (&#36;10/month) goes further by offering programs and workouts, but unless you are invested in the Withings ecosystem, many of these things can already be achieved with an Apple Watch and Fitness+.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2><br/>
Priced significantly higher than many smart scales in the market, the Withings Body Scan represents a considerable investment over other smart devices. It costs almost double that of Withings' <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWITHINGS-Body-Comp-Bluetooth-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0C34ZWCXH%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fcrid%3D27QSIMMKKSU1C%26keywords%3Dwithings%2Bbody%2Bscan%2Bconnected%2Bhealth%2Bstation%26qid%3D1705069926%26sprefix%3Dwithings%2Bbody%2Bscan%252Caps%252C220%26sr%3D8-2">next most expensive model</a>, but that fairly reflects the depth and breadth of health data it provides. For those readings that I could compare on another smart scale, the Body Scan appeared accurate over time, although it's worth noting that occasionally the fat mass measurements on its body segmentation scan appeared to be unrealistically low, and I had to re-take the scan once or twice to get a correct reading.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, its ability to provide detailed insights into various health aspects should make it particularly appealing to health enthusiasts and anyone closely monitoring specific health conditions. That said, if all you want from a smart scale is something to track your weight and general body composition, there are plenty of other cheaper alternatives out there.<br/>

<br/>

First, Apple says to have an iPhone or iPad with Face ID nearby.<br/>
<br/>
"When you order Apple Vision Pro, you'll need to scan your face with an iPhone or iPad with Face ID," wrote Apple, in an email. "This helps us determine the right size Light Seal and head bands, which work together to give you a precise fit."<br/>
<br/>
Second, make sure your Apple Store app is updated, as the latest version released on January 11 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/vision-pro-apple-store-app-face-scan/">supports Vision Pro face scanning</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Third, Apple says customers with vision correction needs will be required to upload a valid, unexpired prescription from a U.S. eye‑care professional after checkout.<br/>
<br/>
"Because Apple Vision Pro is designed to be worn without glasses, we've partnered with ZEISS to create <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/vision-pro-lens-inserts-to-start-at-99/">custom optical inserts</a> that accommodate most prescriptions," wrote Apple, with fine print noting that not all prescriptions are supported. "When you order, we'll ask a few quick questions to find out if you need optical inserts. If you do, you'll upload a valid, unexpired prescription from a U.S. eye‑care professional after checkout."<br/>
<br/>
You can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213226">add and store your vision prescription in the Health app</a> on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
Following pre-orders, the Vision Pro will launch in the U.S. on Friday, February 2. Starting at 8 a.m. local time that day, customers are invited to sign up for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-vision-pro-demos-february-2/">demo of the headset</a> at their local Apple Store, with slots to be available through the weekend on a first-come, first-served basis, according to Apple's email.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S. with 256GB of storage.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> yesterday met the European Union's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> amid a series of disputes between the organizations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/margrethe-vestager-and-tim-cook.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-930327" /><br/>
The meeting focused on European competition policy and digital regulation. On X (formerly Twitter), Vestager explained that she stressed Apple's impending obligation to allow users to install third-party app stores and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/">sideload apps</a> under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). They also spoke about ongoing investigations involving Apple, such as a complaint raised by Spotify against <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, but Vestager declined to provide more specific detail of the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is facing a range of challenges in the EU, such as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/apple-could-pay-ireland-eu-tax-dispute/">&#36;14 billion tax dispute</a> and a potential deal to open up the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s NFC technology to payment services from rival companies. Most strikingly, new EU rules such as the DMA designate major tech companies as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">gatekeepers</a>" and compel them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. The DMA is expected to force Apple to make significant changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> work in Europe.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today confirmed that up to 32 items can be added to the Find My app on the iPhone and iPad, up from a previous limit of 16.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/Find-My-AirPods-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-811280" /><br/>
Apple revealed this information in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211331">support document</a> updated today:<blockquote>You can add up to 32 items in Find My. In addition to AirTag and the third-party Find My network accessories in the Items tab, AirPods Max count as one item, AirPods and AirPods Pro (1st generation) count as two items, and AirPods Pro (2nd generation) count as three items.</blockquote>We confirmed that Apple increased the item limit starting with iOS 16 and iPadOS 16, but the change was not reflected on Apple's website until now.<br/>
<br/>
Items that count towards the limit include AirTags, AirPods, newer MagSafe Wallets, select Beats headphones, third-party accessories with Find My support, and more, according to Apple. Once the items are added to the app, users can track the location of each one on a map across the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Some models of AirPods are considered multiple items due to each individual earbud and charging case being counted separately.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/ces-2024-satechi-qi2-chargers/">Qi2 wireless charging stands</a>, Apple accessory maker Satechi this week unveiled new hubs and charger options for Apple's Mac lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/satechi-stand-and-hub-for-mac-studio.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930279" /><br/>
The upgraded Stand & Hub for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> fits under one of Apple's slim desktop machines, and it includes an NVMe SSD enclosure that supports NVMe and M.2 SATA SSDs. There are USB-C 3.1 and USB-A 3.1 ports for file transfers, with support for speeds up to 10Gb/s.<br/>
<br/>
An SSD added into the hub can be used for Time Machine backups, plus there are also two additional USB-A 3.0 ports, micro/SD card readers, and an audio jack for headphones.<br/>
<br/>
Satechi's Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub Pro has three Thunderbolt 4 downstream ports that support data transfers at up to 40GB/s, plus it can deliver up to 15W of power to connected peripherals. It supports up to two 4K displays or one 8K display, and it offers 32Gb/s native PCIe support for external GPUs and Thunderbolt-based SSDs.<br/>
<br/>

The 145W USB-C 4-Port GaN Travel Charger has two USB-C 3.1 ports that can provide up to 140W and two USB-C 3.0 ports that can provide up to 45W. The 145W max power is split between devices when more than one device is plugged in, with the charger providing smart power distribution that automatically adjusts wattage for optimal charging.<br/>
<br/>

		<title>Apple Store App Will Use Face Scan to Determine Apple Vision Pro Size</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> app will use a facial scan to provide customers with information on the correct Vision Pro component sizes they need to order, according to code found by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris. The Vision Pro requires an appropriately sized Light Seal and Head Band in order to operate as intended.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929939" /><br/>
"You may scan your face to determine your size for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>," reads code in the &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already been using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/27/vision-pro-developer-kit-information/">a Head Measure and Fit app</a> to help developers testing the Vision Pro to find their correct sizes, so it sounds like similar functionality will be built directly into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Light Seals and Head Bands come in several sizes, and the option to use a scan to determine a size suggests that customers will not need to visit an Apple retail store to determine the right fit. A facial scan is likely to be part of the process of ordering the Vision Pro online.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro will ship with both a Solo Knit Band and a Dual Loop Band, the latter of which has a second strap that goes over the head to more evenly distribute weight. A Light Seal and two Light Seal Cushions are included as well. Customers who need prescription lens inserts from ZEISS will be able to import their prescriptions from the Health app or upload their prescription.<br/>
<br/>
Code also suggests that Apple may allow the Vision Pro to be engraved, but it is not clear where an engraving might be able to be located.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to launch the Vision Pro on Friday, February 2, but pre-orders for the device will begin on Friday, January 19 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/vision-pro-apple-store-app-face-scan/">Apple Store App Will Use Face Scan to Determine Apple Vision Pro Size</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-app-will-use-face-scan-to-determine-apple-vision-pro-size.2416102/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Cook's total earnings included a &#36;3 million base salary, &#36;47 million in stock awards, &#36;10.7 million in performance-based bonus awards, and &#36;2.5 million in other compensation, which included 401(k) contributions, term life insurance premiums, vacation cash-out, security expenses, and personal air travel expenses.<br/>
<br/>
Cook owns a total of 3,280,053 shares of Apple stock at the current time, as well as an additional 1,291,086 RSUs that have not yet vested.<br/>
<br/>
In 2023, Apple's board of directors, shareholders, and Cook himself decided to decrease Cook's compensation. His target award was &#36;49 million, which was ultimately exceeded due Apple's performance. For 2024, Cook's target equity award is set at &#36;50 million, with 75 percent of that subjected to performance-based vesting.<br/>
<br/>
Other senior executives, including Luca Maestri, Kate Adams, Deirdre O'Brien, and Jeff Williams, earned approximately &#36;27 million each, most in the form of stock awards.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/tim-cook-compensation-2023/">Apple CEO Tim Cook Earned &#36;63.2 Million in 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-earned-63-2-million-in-2023.2416100/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Both Al Gore and James Bell are retiring from Apple's board of directors, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/wanda-austin-to-join-apples-board-of-directors/">Apple announced today</a>. Dr. Wanda Austin, former president and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, has been nominated to join the board as the two depart.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Logo-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924188" /><br/>
According to Apple, Dr. Austin brings "decades of science and technology experience" to the role, and she has a track record of "advancing innovation and shaping corporate strategy."<blockquote>"Wanda has spent decades advancing technology on behalf of humanity, and we're thrilled to welcome her to Apple's board of directors," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "She's an extraordinary leader, and her invaluable experience and expertise will support our mission of leaving the world better than we found it."<br/>
<br/>
"Like Apple, I've always believed in the power of innovation to improve lives, support human potential, and shape a better future," said Dr. Austin. "I'm honored to join Apple's board of directors, and I look forward to being part of a company that's always creating new ways to empower people all over the world."</blockquote><br/>
Apple does not allow directors to stand for reelection after reaching age 75, which means that both Al Gore and James Bell are retiring from the board due to their age.<br/>
<blockquote>"We're deeply grateful to Al and James for their many years of service to Apple -- their insights, energy, and values have made us a stronger company in so many ways," said Cook. "For more than 20 years, Al has contributed an incredible amount to our work -- from his unconditional support for protecting our users' privacy, to his incomparable knowledge of environment and climate issues. James's dedication has been extraordinary, and we're thankful for the important perspectives and deep expertise he's offered on audit, finance, and so much more over the years."</blockquote><br/>
Al Gore first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2003/03/19/al-gore-joins-apples-board/">joined Apple's board in 2003</a>, while James Bell <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/10/01/james-bell-apple-director/">joined in 2015</a>. Dr. Austin has a Ph.D in industrial and systems engineering. She joined The Aerospace Corporation in 1979, and from 2008 to 2016, she served as the organization's president and CEO. From 2018 to 2019, she was the interim president of the University of Southern California, and she also serves on the boards of Amgen and Chevron. She previously was on the board of Virgin Galactic. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/apple-board-of-directors-retirees/">Al Gore and James Bell to Retire From Apple&#039;s Board of Directors, Dr. Wanda Austin to Join</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/al-gore-and-james-bell-to-retire-from-apples-board-of-directors-dr-wanda-austin-to-join.2416096/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to produce between 60,000 and 80,000 Vision Pro units for the February 2 launch of the device, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1745516663867629912">analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. With the small size of the shipment, Kuo believes that the Vision Pro will "sell out soon after the release."<br/>
<br/>

According to Kuo, though Apple has not yet defined the key applications for the Vision Pro and the price is high, the "groundbreaking technology innovations" and Apple's "base of core fans and heavy users" will exhaust supplies of the device.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo made similar comments <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/kuo-apple-vision-pro-may-sell-out-fast/">earlier this week</a> when he said that demand for the headset would cause it to sell out during pre-orders, and he believes there will be long shipping delays after the initial launch period. Apple is expected to produce fewer than 400,000 Vision Pro headsets in 2024 due to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-vision-pro-drastic-production-cuts/">complexity of manufacturing</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The first run of Vision Pro headsets might sell out quick, but Kuo says that so far, it is unclear if the demand for the Vision Pro will be sustained "after the novelty wears off." Continued sales will depend on "clear and correct" product positioning and key applications from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to release the Vision Pro on Friday, February 2, but pre-orders will be accepted starting on January 19 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Orders are limited to the United States for the time being, and Apple has not yet provided details on when the headset might be available in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
Customers that are planning to pick up one of the &#36;3,500 Vision Pro devices should plan to pre-order immediately in order to ensure a headset on launch day.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/kuo-vision-pro-sellout-likely/">Kuo: Apple Will Only Produce Up to 80,000 Vision Pro Headsets for Launch, Sellout Likely</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-will-only-produce-up-to-80-000-vision-pro-headsets-for-launch-sellout-likely.2416083/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon continues to provide steep discounts on multiple AirPods models this week, with the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C at an all-time low price and the AirPods 3 and AirPods 2 at solid second-best prices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-2-and-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895348" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The newest AirPods model, the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, is available for the record low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;249.00. Amazon provides an estimated delivery date of January 13 through January 16 if ordered today.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;60 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case have hit <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;149.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;169.00. We've seen this one down about &#36;10 cheaper in past sales, but this remains the best deal that we've tracked since the holidays.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft today overtook Apple as the world's most valuable public company by market value. Apple's share price dropped by just one percent, enabling Microsoft to narrowly pull ahead of Apple at a value of &#36;2.87 trillion.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/aapl-logo-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="890" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-776656" /><br/>
Microsoft has briefly overtaken Apple as the most valuable company since 2018, most recently in 2020 and 2021 when concerns about supply chain shortages dented Apple's stock price and a boom in remote working bolstered Microsoft. Over the past year, Microsoft's support for artificial intelligence tools by backing OpenAI has helped boost its value, while equivalent offerings from Apple have been noticeably absent.<br/>
<br/>
In its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/apple-4q-2023-results/">November earnings report</a>, Apple's sales results missed expectations as demand for iPads and wearables was lower than expected. Mac revenue also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/mac-revenue-down-m3-sales-improvements/">saw a major drop</a> compared to the previous year. It is yet to be seen how responses to the Vision Pro headset will influence the market, but expectations are relatively low due to low sales forecasts and the device's high price point.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update 1:40 pm</b>: By the close of the regular trading day, Apple had retaken the top spot in market capitalization at &#36;2.89 trillion compared to Microsoft's &#36;2.86 trillion, and the companies may swap places multiple times in the coming days and weeks as they remain close in value.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/microsoft-overtakes-apple-as-most-valuable-company/">Microsoft Overtakes Apple as World&#039;s Most Valuable Company [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-overtakes-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company-updated.2416064/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today received approval to sell the HomePod mini in Malaysia, according to a local regulatory filing <a href="https://twitter.com/XavierNaxa/status/1745442408656179388">uncovered by Xavier Naxa</a>.<br/>

It's unclear when the HomePod mini will be available in Malaysia, but sales will presumably begin on Apple's online store there within the next few months. Apple has yet to receive approval to sell the full-size second-generation HomePod in the country.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first released the HomePod mini in October 2020 in the U.S., and it is now sold in around 25 countries. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/homepod-mini-new-colors/">New color options</a> were added in November 2021, and the speaker's previously-unused temperature and humidity sensor was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/homepods-now-feature-temperature-humidity-sensor/">activated last year</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[When Apple first unveiled its next-generation Vision Pro headset at WWDC 2023, the company shared promotional videos that briefly teased the potential applications of using the &#36;3,499 spatial computing device in conjunction with a Mac. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-macbook.jpg" alt="" width="3022" height="1698" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930147" /><br/>
Despite Apple's announcement that Vision Pro will launch on February 2, Apple has yet to expand on the specifics of how the two devices work together. But sift through code and marketing materials, and there are subtle indications about what is possible - and what the limitations are likely to be. Here's what we know.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Mac and Vision Pro: What You Can Do</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Create a Virtual Desktop</span><br><br/>
When it comes to the Mac, the keystone feature of Apple Vision Pro is something called Mac Virtual Display. The system uses AirPlay 2, and allows you to connect your Mac wirelessly to the headset just by looking at your computer through your Vision Pro. According to Apple, this allows you to place and resize a virtual representation of your Mac's display anywhere in space, and "use Vision Pro as an enormous, private, portable 4K display, ideal for pro workflows." <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Use visionOS Apps Alongside Your Mac</span><br><br/>
With Mac Virtual Display enabled, you will be able to able use visionOS apps right alongside your virtual Mac screen. This will allow you to, for example, work on a Final Cut Pro project on an enormous Mac display while also viewing and interacting with separate screens displaying visionOS apps like Photos, Notes, Files, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Mirror Vision Pro to Mac</span><br><br/>
Apple Vision Pro supports screen mirroring via AirPlay or FaceTime, according to code found in early beta releases of visionOS, the headset's unique operating system. When wearing Vision Pro, you will be able to select a Mac to mirror content to from the headset, allowing you to share your view with others and reduce any sense of isolation.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Connect Mac Accessories</span><br><br/>
Vision Pro includes a virtual keyboard for spatial computing sessions, but you can also wirelessly connect Mac accessories to the Vision Pro, including the Magic Keyboard and the Magic Trackpad for more traditional tactile input. Attaching Bluetooth accessories allows for a typical Mac workflow to continue to be used, just with the Mac display replaced by Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Mac and Vision Pro: What You (Likely) Can't Do</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Arrange Mac Apps in Virtual Space</span><br><br/>
Prior to Apple's official unveiling of Vision Pro, many Mac users envisioned an ideal multitasking scenario where it would be possible to break out Mac apps individually in a mixed reality workspace and switch attention between them at a glance. Based on the information available, however, it is not possible to view individual Mac apps in virtual windows alongside one another in Vision Pro's spatial computing environment.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Create Multiple Virtual Displays</span><br><br/>
Another likely limitation of the first-generation Vision Pro is that it only supports mirroring your Mac's built-in display. In other words, it won't be possible to extend your Mac's screen or recreate a multiple monitor Mac setup in the mixed reality workspace. This could be due to bandwidth limitations (Mac Virtual Display outputs in 4K). On that basis, multiple Mac displays in Vision Pro's spatial computing environment may be something supported in a future version, but don't expect such functionality out of the box.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Connect an Intel Mac</span><br><br/>
This should probably go without saying, but older Macs based on Intel architecture won't come along for the ride into the spatial computing future. Though Apple hasn't come out and said it officially, only Apple silicon Macs are likely to have the processing horsepower to communicate with Vision Pro, which itself relies on Apple's M2 processor to do the heavy lifting.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Apple Vision Pro and the Future of Mac</span><br><br/>
As the above suggests, there are still some unknowns about Mac and Vision Pro interoperability. Bearing that in mind, are you optimistic about the future of Mac in the era of spatial computing? What, if anything, disappoints you about Vision Pro support for the Mac? Let us know in the comments. <br/>

The update isn't quite as large as the prior iOS 17.2 update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-beta-features/">in terms of new features</a> so the testing period won't be as long, and we are expecting it to launch before the end of January.<br/>

In terms of timing, a launch the week of January 22nd might make the most sense. We've had three betas, two of which have not added anything particularly notable, suggesting there isn't much testing left. If Apple plans to launch the update on the 22nd or the 23rd, we can expect to see the release candidate version of the iOS 17.3 update on the 15th, followed by the launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could also release iOS 17.3 on the week of the 29th, but that is the week that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> and the Vision Pro headset will be coming out. Apple does sometimes tie software release updates together, but as an entirely new operating system, &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; isn't likely to be accompanied by any other updates.<br/>
<br/>
The last new operating system update that Apple came out with was watchOS back in 2015. watchOS saw its official release on Friday, April 24, 2015, the same day that the first Apple Watch models launched.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/23/apple-releases-ios-16-3/">released iOS 16.3</a> on January 23, and in 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/26/apple-releases-ios-15-3/">released iOS 15.3</a> on January 26, so a January 22 launch date for iOS 17.3 would be in line with Apple's past release timelines.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-beta-features/">main new feature</a> is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">Stolen Device Protection</a>, a feature that prevents a thief that somehow gains access to both your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and your passcode from accessing sensitive information. It locks several features behind a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> scan, preventing a thief from viewing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain passwords, turning off Lost Mode, using Safari payment methods, and more.<br/>
<br/>
It also adds a time-based delay before allowing &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, or Stolen Device Protection to be turned off, and before letting an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> or &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; passcode be changed.<br/>
<br/>
Along with Stolen Device Protection, iOS 17.3 adds Collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Playlists, a feature originally intended for iOS 17.2. With Collaborative Playlists, multiple people can contribute to one shared &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; playlist.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/when-will-ios-17-3-be-released/">When Will iOS 17.3 Be Released?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-will-ios-17-3-be-released.2416033/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
