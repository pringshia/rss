		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/newsroom/2023/10/apple-introduces-new-apple-pencil-bringing-more-value-and-choice-to-the-lineup/">announced</a> an updated version of the cellular 10th-generation iPad with eSIM support in mainland China. Apple says the device will be available to pre-order in mainland China starting October 19 and released on October 25.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Fanned-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869881" /><br/>
China Unicom is currently the only supported eSIM carrier for the iPad in mainland China, according to a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213954">new Apple support document</a>. eSIM support in mainland China requires a 10th-generation iPad (Wi-Fi + Cellular) with model number A3162. All other iPad and iPhone models do not have eSIM support in mainland China.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's support document offers more details on how to set up an eSIM on the updated 10th-generation iPad in mainland China, and how to activate eSIM cellular data plans on the device from carriers in other countries while traveling.<br/>
<br/>
An eSIM is a digital SIM that allows users to activate a cellular plan without having to use a physical nano-SIM card.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> software 17.1 update that is set to be released in the near future, Apple is bringing support for Enhance Dialogue to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> and the original &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793543" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/AppleTV-and-HomePod-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
Enhance Dialogue is a feature that is meant to boost the volume of spoken voices to make dialogue easier to hear over effects, action, and music in a movie or TV show. The feature works when a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is paired to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and used as the audio output option.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to now, Enhance Dialogue was available on the second-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, and it was a feature that was first introduced in tvOS 17. With tvOS 17.1 and &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; software 17.1, Enhance Dialogue can be enabled on any &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; (or set of HomePods) paired to an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K.<br/>
<br/>
Enabling Enhance Dialogue can be done by playing a TV show or movie, bringing up the playback controls with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Remote, and choosing the Enhance Dialogue feature from the Audio Options button. It can be enabled for all content by going to Settings &gt; Video and Audio &gt; Enhance Dialogue.<br/>
<br/>
Apple today seeded the final beta version of the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 17.1 software, and it should see a release as soon as next week alongside iOS 17.1 and tvOS 17.1.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/homepod-software-17-1-enhance-dialogue/">Upcoming 17.1 Software Brings Enhance Dialogue to Original HomePod and HomePod mini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-17-1-software-brings-enhance-dialogue-to-original-homepod-and-homepod-mini.2407885/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>32-Inch iMac With Mini-LED Display Rumored to Launch in 2025</title>

		<description><![CDATA[A higher-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> with a mini-LED 32-inch display will come out in 2025, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1714350456565350625">Apple analyst Ming-Chi</a> Kuo. Kuo does not specify, but this machine could be positioned as an "&zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro" to replace the 2017 model that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/imac-pro-officially-discontinued/">discontinued two years ago</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
There have been multiple rumors of a larger &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; over the last couple of years, but the information has been confused with standalone display options and products that Apple ultimately shelved, leading to some confusion over if and when we would see a larger &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; option. The 27-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; was also nixed in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
After the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro was discontinued, Apple replaced it with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> and its matching 27-inch Studio Display, and there has been no sign of a larger &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; since then. It sounds like that is set to change in 2025, with Apple using the same mini-LED technology that has been introduced in the more expensive Pro Display XDR.<br/>
<br/>
At 32 inches, a larger &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; would offer the same dimensions as the 6K Pro Display XDR, which Apple sells for &#36;5,000. As for the design, we could perhaps see slimmer bezels and a machine that is ultimately modeled after the Studio Display, with Apple eliminating the chin, but rumors are not clear on this point.<div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">32-Inch iMac With Mini-LED Display Rumored to Launch in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/32-inch-imac-with-mini-led-display-rumored-to-launch-in-2025.2407881/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will release a new 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> in 2024, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1714350456565350625">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo's prediction is in line with previous rumors from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, who has also said that a new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is likely to come in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-M3-Blue-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917291" /><br/>
Kuo does not mention which chip Apple will use, but Gurman has claimed that Apple will use the M3 chip in the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;. The M3 chip is expected to feature an 8-core GPU and 10-core GPU, and because it is built on a new 3-nanometer process, it will have performance and efficiency improvements. <br/>
<br/>
The current 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; came out in 2021, and it is equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. Apple has opted not to update the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; since the debut of the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip, so it is overdue for a refresh.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has long maintained that Apple has no intention of introducing an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> version of the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, which would be accurate with Kuo's projected timeline. Last week, Japanese site <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macotakara-jp/">Mac Otakara</a></em> said that Apple would release a 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro chips i<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/imac-m2-and-m2-pro-rumor/">n the near future</a>, but that appears to be inaccurate. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">Kuo: New 24-Inch iMac Coming in 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-new-24-inch-imac-coming-in-2024.2407880/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.1 update that Apple is set to release in the near future addresses an issue that "may cause display image persistence," according to Apple's feature notes for the software.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iphone-15-sizes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912524" /><br/>
Since the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, there have been sporadic <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/severe-burn-in-on-my-iphone-15-pro-max.2406278/">reports of severe screen burn-in</a> impacting the new devices. There <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/174k2jr/comment/k4b93ic">was speculation</a> that it might be a hardware issue with the OLED display, but based on the iOS 17.1 update, Apple has found and addressed a software problem that mimicked screen burn-in.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iphone-15-display-burn-in.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="4032" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917271" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Image via MacRumors reader Josh</div></em><br/>
While most of the reports of display problems were coming from &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; users, there were also some users with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 Pro devices that saw similar issues, which is likely why Apple's release notes do not mention the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; specifically.<br/>
<br/>
Those who have noticed "burn-in" on their iPhones should update to iOS 17.1 to ensure that it solves the problem.<br/>
<br/>
The iOS 17.1 update also addresses a number of other bugs. It fixes an issue that could cause the Significant Location privacy setting to reset when transferring or pairing an Apple Watch for the first time, plus it addresses a bug that could cause custom and purchased ringtones not to appear as options for a text tone.<br/>
<br/>
There is a fix for an issue that could cause the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; keyboard to be less responsive, and Apple says that it has added crash detection optimizations for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models to further refine how the iPhones respond when a vehicle crash event is detected.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/ios-17-1-display-image-retention-fix/">iOS 17.1 Fixes iPhone Display Image Retention Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-fixes-iphone-display-image-retention-issue.2407869/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 17.1 improves syncing of Screen Time settings across Apple devices, according to the release notes for the upcoming software update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Screen-Time-iOS-16.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905106" /><br/>
Screen Time provides parents with settings to remotely manage a child's device, allowing them to restrict device usage to certain times, set time limits for apps, and block inappropriate content. However, some parents had complained that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/30/apple-promises-further-updates-to-screen-time/">Screen Time settings sometimes reset or failed to sync across all devices</a> within a Family Sharing group.<br/>
<br/>
"We are aware that some users may be experiencing an issue where Screen Time settings are unexpectedly reset," an Apple spokesperson said, in a statement shared with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in July. "We take these reports very seriously and we have been, and will continue, making updates to improve the situation."<br/>
<br/>
Apple already attempted to improve Screen Time settings syncing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-16-5-features/">with iOS 16.5</a>, but the issue persisted for some users on later software versions.<br/>
<br/>
Screen Time launched in 2018 as part of iOS 12, providing parents with a built-in option for the type of controls that previously required third-party apps.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate versions of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to developers and public beta testers for testing purposes, with the betas coming one week after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-3-to-developers/">released the third betas</a> of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912331" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta. Public beta testers will need to follow the same steps after opting in to the beta through Apple's public beta testing website. <br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 adds the option to favorite songs, albums, playlists, artists, and more, with favorited content added to the Library and used for suggestions. Favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen using the Now Playing widget, plus when starting a playlist, you'll now see Song Suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
AirDrop transfers can be finished over the internet so close proximity does not need to be maintained, and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 can now use NameDrop with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running iOS 17.1. On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, iOS 17.1 ensures you won't activate the Camera or Flashlight in your pocket.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include a flashlight indicator in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> for non &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, and a Wallet feature that lets U.S. Discover card users and those in the UK connect their banks to see balances and transactions. Apple's release notes for the update are below:<br/>
<blockquote><strong>AirDrop</strong><br/>
- Content continues to transfer over the internet when you step out of AirDrop range<br/>
<br/>
<strong>StandBy</strong><br/>
- New options to control when the display turns off (iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Music</strong><br/>
- Favorites expanded to include songs, albums, and playlists, and you can filter to display your favorites in the library<br/>
- New cover art collection offers designs that change colors to reflect the music in your playlist<br/>
- Song suggestions appear at the bottom of every playlist, making it easy to add music that matches the vibe of your playlist<br/>
<br/>
<strong>This update also includes the following improvements and bug fixes:</strong><br/>
- Option to choose a specific album to use with Photo Shuffle on the Lock Screen<br/>
- Home key support for Matter locks<br/>
- Improved reliability of Screen Time settings syncing across devices<br/>
- Fixes an issue that may cause the Significant Location privacy setting to reset when transferring an Apple Watch or pairing it for the first time<br/>
- Resolves an issue where the names of incoming callers may not appear when you are on another call<br/>
- Addresses an issue where custom and purchased ringtones may not appear as options for your text tone<br/>
- Fixes an issue that may cause the keyboard to be less responsive<br/>
- Crash detection optimizations (all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models)<br/>
- Fixes an issue that may cause display image persistence<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate version of an upcoming watchOS 10.1 update to developers and public beta testers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/apple-releases-watchos-10-1-beta-3/">release of the third watchOS 10.1 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901009" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Watch-Faces-watchOS-10-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
To install the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>‌.1 update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌.1 Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required. Public beta testers will need to follow the same steps after opting in to the beta through Apple's public beta testing website. <br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, ‌watchOS 10.1‌ can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.1 adds NameDrop support for sharing contact information with another Apple Watch or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, plus it includes Double Tap.<br/>
<br/>
NameDrop can be used by tapping into the Apple Watch Contacts app, selecting your profile, and tapping on the "Share" option. From there, touching the Apple Watch to another Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 or an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> will initiate a contact transfer.<br/>
<br/>
Double Tap is a gesture exclusive to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the Apple Watch Ultra, and it allows users to tap their thumb and index fingers together to do things like bring up the Smart Stack, start a call, pause a song, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/apple-seeds-watchos-10-1-rc/">Apple Seeds watchOS 10.1 Release Candidate to Developers and Public Beta Testers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-watchos-10-1-release-candidate-to-developers-and-public-beta-testers.2407864/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate of an upcoming tvOS 17.1 to developers and public beta testers, with the software coming a week after the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-beta-3/">third tvOS 17.1 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers can download the tvOS 17.1 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required. Public beta testers will need to follow the same steps after opting in to the beta through Apple's public beta testing website. <br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. tvOS 17.1 adds a new favoriting option to the Music app on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, along with some other minor Music changes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't often know much about what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release. Apple has also seeded a new beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 17.1 software for developers.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-rc/">Apple Seeds tvOS 17.1 Release Candidate to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-release-candidate-to-developers.2407867/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the past four days, there were several conflicting rumors about Apple announcing new iPads, a new Apple Pencil, or a combination of those two things. In the end, the only product announced was a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">lower-cost Apple Pencil with a USB-C port</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Below, we have put together a rumor report card that recaps all of the reports and speculation leading up to Apple's press release today.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Accurate</h2><ul><li><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/mark-gurman-on-new-ipads-and-macs/">would not be any new iPads released this month</a>, a claim that remains accurate.</li><br/>
<li>Last month, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">new iPads were unlikely for the remainder of 2023</a>, a claim that remains accurate.</li><br/>
<li>Japanese blog <em>Mac Otakara</em> said it believed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/apple-pencil-3-magnetic-tips-rumor/">a new Apple Pencil was likely to be announced instead of new iPads</a>, although it was not a third-generation model with interchangeable magnetic tips, as the report suggested it would be.</li><br/>
<li><em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser found <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/ios-17-1-apple-pencil-usb-c/">references to an Apple Pencil with USB-C charging</a> in the second beta of iPadOS 17.1.</li><br/>
<li></li></ul><h2>Inaccurate</h2><ul><li><em>Supercharged</em>'s Sami Fathi reported that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/mark-gurman-on-new-ipads-and-macs/">Apple would announce new iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad models today</a>, but there are no new iPads.</li><br/>
<li><em>9to5Mac</em> initially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231015085450/https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/15/apple-to-announce-new-ipad-models-this-week-featuring-upgraded-chips/">corroborated the report</a> about new iPads, citing its own sources.</li><br/>
<li>A leaker known as "Majin Bu" on X, formerly known as Twitter, said an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/leaker-claims-low-cost-ipad-launching-tomorrow/">11th-generation entry-level iPad would be announced today</a>.</ul><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-rumor-report-card/">Rumor Report Card: New Apple Pencil Announced Instead of New iPads</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-report-card-new-apple-pencil-announced-instead-of-new-ipads.2407853/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-introduces-new-apple-pencil-bringing-more-value-and-choice-to-the-lineup/">today unveiled</a> an all-new, more affordable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> model featuring a USB-C port hidden behind a sliding cap.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917176" /><br/>
The new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is a cheaper model that sits below the first- and second-generation Apple Pencils in the lineup with a price tag of just &#36;79. It features a sliding cap at the top that reveals a USB-C port, allowing users to charge and pair via a USB-C cable, with a matte finish and design reminiscent of the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. When magnetically attached to the side of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, the new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; enters into a sleep state to preserve battery life. Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, said:<blockquote>Apple Pencil has revolutionized note taking, sketching, and illustrating, unleashing endless possibilities for productivity and creativity. Combined with the versatility of iPad, the new Apple Pencil unlocks another great option to experience the magic of digital handwriting, annotation, marking up documents, and more.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; features low latency and tilt sensitivity like the other &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models, but misses out on pressure sensitivity, wireless pairing and charging, double tap to change tools, and free engraving. However, unlike the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, it does support &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover on the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models. It is compatible with all &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models that feature a USB-C port. <br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is priced at &#36;79 and launches in early November. The first- and second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models continue to be available for &#36;99 and &#36;129, respectively.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">New Apple Pencil Announced With Hidden USB-C Port and More for &#36;79</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-pencil-announced-with-hidden-usb-c-port-and-more-for-79.2407830/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> has made a surprise visit to China amid reports that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> sales are down in the country compared to last year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-17/apple-s-cook-cheers-on-tencent-game-gala-in-surprise-china-visit">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Tim-Cook-iPhone-15-launch.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="520" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917158" /><br/>
Cook visited an Apple's Taikoo Li store in Chengdu to watch a local gaming tournament for the major Tencent game "Honor of Kings" and talk to shoppers and staff. Cook later posted about the event <a href="https://weibo.com/timcook">on Weibo</a> with a short video, saying that "the energy tonight was off the charts!" Cook then visited a Yucheng elementary school to see how students use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> to support local culture.<br/>
 <br/>
The appearance comes just a day after two <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-16/iphone-15-china-sales-disappoint-as-huawei-rises-jefferies-says">Counterpoint Research studies</a> claimed that &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; sales are down 4.5% versus last year's &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; lineup in China, causing Apple's share price to fall. As a result, Cook's visit is being widely associated with concern about &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; sales in China across various mainstream media outlets.<br/>
<br/>
Cook's posts on Weibo during the trip have also aroused a usual amount of ire. For example, Cook shared a photo of Chengdu at night shot on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max. The post was then "flooded with complaints" about the ostensibly poor quality of the image and unfavorable comparisons to pictures from Chinese devices like Huawei's recently Mate 60 Pro.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/">Counterpoint</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/cook-visits-china-amid-reports-of-iphone-15-sales/">Apple CEO Tim Cook Visits China Amid Reports of Lower iPhone 15 Sales</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-visits-china-amid-reports-of-lower-iphone-15-sales.2407825/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is rumored to be introducing a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> as soon as tomorrow, so with a potential announcement on the horizon, we thought we'd round up a list of the features that are said to be coming in the next update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/apple-pencil-memorial-day.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897359" /><br/>
<h2>The Current Rumors</h2><br/>
While we've been hearing about a third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; for several months now, it was just this weekend that Japanese site <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macotakara-jp/">Mac Otakara</a></em> said that a new model is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/apple-pencil-3-magnetic-tips-rumor/">set to launch imminently</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The rumor came in response <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/mark-gurman-on-new-ipads-and-macs/">to another rumor</a> about new iPads. Apparently, Apple has media briefings scheduled for this week with some YouTubers, and those meetings are said to be focused on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. No more specific information has been leaked, so it's unclear whether we're going to get iPads, iPads and an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, or just an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
What seems clear is that some kind of announcement is happening tomorrow via press release.<br/>
<h2>Magnetic Tips</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 3 is said to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">swappable magnetic tips</a> that are for different activities like drawing, sketching, and writing. Apple could go with tips of different thicknesses and shapes.<br/>
<br/>
A thin tip, for example, would be ideal for writing, but those who are sketching and drawing might want the option for something thicker or a tip in a different shape.<br/>
<br/>
Majin Bu, the leaker who shared the rumor, said the tips would be used for different purposes, but there is also a possibility that the tips will be the same, but magnetically detachable to make it easier to swap them out when one wears down.<br/>
<h2>Design Changes</h2><br/>
Way back in 2021, there was a leaked third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with a shorter length and a glossy, rounded finish, but it is not clear if that is an accurate depiction of the planned third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; given that it was so long ago.<br/>
<br/>
That model did, however, have a larger tip component that could actually make sense with swappable magnetic tips.<br/>
<h2>Color</h2><br/>
There were rumors that the next &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/02/future-apple-pencil-black-color/">available in white and black</a>, but that rumor dates all the way back to 2020, so it's unlikely to be accurate at this point in time.<br/>
<h2>USB-C and Consolidation</h2><br/>
Right now, Apple sells two Apple Pencils, the first-generation model that's compatible with the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and the second-generation model that works with everything else.<br/>
<br/>
With the transition to USB-C, an update to the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; makes sense. Apple could design a third-generation model that works with all iPads, including future low-cost models to eliminate the need to have two Apple Pencils, or it could design a new version of the original &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that charges over USB-C to accommodate the USB-C port that's already been introduced in the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, the original &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; has a Lightning connector, and charging it with the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; requires an adapter, an unwieldy and inconvenient setup.<br/>
<h2>Will There or Won't There Be an iPad Refresh?</h2><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> and Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple does not have plans to introduce new iPads tomorrow. Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/mark-gurman-on-new-ipads-and-macs/">said over the weekend</a> that while new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, and entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models are in the works with faster chips, an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; refresh "won't happen this month." Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">said back in September</a> that new iPads are "unlikely" to launch in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Both <em>9to5Mac</em> and <em>Supercharged News</em> have claimed that Apple will announce updated &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, and entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models this week.<br/>
<br/>
It would be unusual for Apple to debut a new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; without introducing new iPads, but Kuo and Gurman often have reliable insight in to Apple's plans, so it doesn't seem out of the question. It is possible that we could see Apple introduce a new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and a new low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, as that is a tablet that is typically refreshed yearly and it is also the sole remaining tablet that uses the original &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Refreshing the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; would allow Apple to introduce a new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that works with all &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models, doing away with the split &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
If we do get new iPads, there are no major redesigns or flashy features in the works. All of the rumors so far suggest that only minor spec bumps like chip improvements are in the works.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will introduce a new low-cost 11th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> tomorrow, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1714024008767680536">leaker Majin Bu</a>. Majin Bu claims that the new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will have the same design as the 10th-generation model, and that accessories "will be perfectly compatible."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/ipad-green-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904791" /><br/>
Last week, the same leaker claimed that Apple would debut a third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">interchangeable magnetic tips</a>, and today's rumor comes following conflicting reports about products that Apple might be introducing tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said on Sunday that while new iPads are in development, new models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/mark-gurman-on-new-ipads-and-macs/">not expected this month</a>, while reports from <em>9to5Mac</em> and <em>Supercharged News</em> claimed that Apple plans to introduce new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models as soon as Tuesday. Separately, Japanese site <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macotakara-jp/">Mac Otakara</a></em> reported that Apple doesn't have plans to introduce new iPads, but will debut a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/apple-pencil-3-magnetic-tips-rumor/">new Apple Pencil 3 instead</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Majin Bu's report of an 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; does not mention the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; or the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, and it also seems to suggest that the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will be accompanied by compatible accessories, perhaps a new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; as suggested by <em>&zwnj;Mac Otakara&zwnj;</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Majin Bu is known for sharing rumors from Weibo and other sources, but the information that we hear is often hit or miss. At this point, it is unclear whether we're going to get new iPads, an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, or some combination of both, but we'll find out more in the morning.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/leaker-claims-low-cost-ipad-launching-tomorrow/">Leaker Claims New 11th-Generation Low-Cost iPad Will Launch Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaker-claims-new-11th-generation-low-cost-ipad-will-launch-tomorrow.2407782/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's quarterly iPad revenue will significantly decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 on a year-over-year basis, according to estimated figures shared today by Erik Woodring, an analyst at investment firm Morgan Stanley.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-mini-and-Air-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915872" /><br/>
Morgan Stanley estimates that Apple will report iPad revenue of &#36;7.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, which would be a decline of approximately 23% compared to the &#36;9.4 billion that Apple reported for the segment in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
The year-ago quarter will be a tough comparison for iPad revenue, according to Morgan Stanley, as Apple announced updated iPad Pro models and the 10th-generation iPad last October. Over the weekend, two reports indicated that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/mark-gurman-on-new-ipads-and-macs/">Apple plans to announce updated iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad models this week</a>, although some credible sources like <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman have cast doubt on this rumor.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear if Morgan Stanley expects new iPads to launch this month, but given the firm expects iPad revenue to significantly decline this quarter, the firm is at least not expecting any iPad updates that are major enough for revenue growth. Only minor changes are expected for the next iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad whenever the devices are released, including an M2 chip for the iPad Air and an A16 Bionic chip for the iPad mini.<br/>
<br/>
There are also rumors of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/apple-pencil-3-magnetic-tips-rumor/">third-generation Apple Pencil with interchangeable magnetic tips</a> for drawing, technical drawing, and digital painting.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to release any new iPads this year. If that trend continues for the remainder of 2023, it would be the first calendar year with no new iPads released in the device's 13-year history. The two reports expecting new iPad models this week said Apple's announcement would likely be on Tuesday, so we'll see what happens tomorrow.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/morgan-stanley/">Morgan Stanley</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-revenue-to-decline-in-q4-2023-morgan-stanley/">New iPads or Not? iPad Revenue Predicted to Sharply Drop in Q4 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipads-or-not-ipad-revenue-predicted-to-sharply-drop-in-q4-2023.2407760/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We're over a month away from Black Friday, but as always we're already seeing a few retailers kick off very early "pre-Black Friday" events. Today that includes Anker, which is offering <a href="https://howl.me/ckNTaeRyl5Y">up to 50 percent off select charging accessories</a>, as well as a buy one, get one half off sitewide through October 18.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In terms of the BOGO sale, you'll need to purchase two charging products that are not already discounted in order to get the discount. If two or more items are purchased, Anker will automatically take 50 percent off the least expensive item.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> will feature four main upgrades and changes, according to a Weibo leaker with an early track record for disclosing accurate information about Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPad-mini-review-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="4114" height="2314" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-818321" /><br/>
The account, known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Instant Digital</a>," claims that the seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will feature four key differences, with no other other notable improvements other than the following changes.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>A16 Bionic Chip</h3><br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will apparently sport the A16 Bionic chip, offering a modest upgrade over the current model that features the A15 Bionic.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iphone-15-a16-bionic.jpg" alt="" width="2030" height="1142" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912526" /><br/>
The A16 Bionic would put the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; on par with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. The chip would deliver around 10% better performance, 50% more GPU memory bandwidth, and a new image processor (ISP) compared to the current model. The chip upgrade is by far the most widely reported upgrade rumored for the seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Upgraded Front and Rear Cameras</h3><br/>
Instant Digital also claims that the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will receive upgraded front and rear cameras, but further details about what exactly this will entail are unclear.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/ipad-mini-rear-camera.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="825" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-816896" /><br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; has a 12-megapixel rear camera with an ƒ/1.8 aperture and a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front-facing camera with an ƒ/2.4 aperture. This is the same front and rear camera unit used across all of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
The change could take the form of a tangible upgrade to the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s camera hardware, or it could encompass software features like Photonic Engine, which has not yet been offered on any &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models. ProRes video recording, Audio zoom, stereo audio recording, Portrait mode, and Portrait Lighting support are all plausible upgrades in this area.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New Color Options</h3><br/>
The seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will be available in a selection of new color options, Instant Digital claims.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/ipad-mini-6-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="1953" height="1186" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-816894" /><br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is available in Space Gray, Starlight, Pink, and Purple. Apple could retain some of these colors and swap one or two out for new options, or it could overhaul the entire selection. It is not clear what new finishes could be in store, but it is possible Apple could take inspiration from the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;'s Black, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Pink <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-color-options/">color options</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Display With Reduced 'Jelly Scrolling' Effect</h3><br/>
Last week, Instant Digital said that the seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s screen assembly will be rotated to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">reduce the effect of "jelly scrolling"</a> that some users complain about with the current model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ipad-mini-9.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-818328" /><br/>
"Jelly scrolling" refers to screen tearing, which can cause text or images on one side of the screen to appear to be tilted downwards because of a mismatch in refresh rates. It can cause one side of the display to look as if it is responding faster than the other side in a visual disturbance that is hard to ignore once noticed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the phenomenon is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/28/apple-jelly-scrolling-normal-behavior/">normal behavior</a> for LCD iPads. Since LCD screens refresh line by line, there is a tiny delay between when the lines at the top and lines at the bottom are refreshed. But while this may be normal behavior for LCD screens, it can appear more obvious when observed on the ‌‌&zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s smaller screen‌‌.<br/>
<br/>
Users have generally only complained about jelly scrolling when the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/ipad-mini-6-jelly-scroll-issue-vertical/">in portrait orientation</a>. The issue is not reproducible in landscape orientation when scrolling, indicating this is a vertical refresh issue. According to the latest rumor, Apple plans to rotate the screen assembly to reduce the jelly scrolling effect in portrait orientation. Whether it will now become more prominent when the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is in landscape orientation is yet to be seen, but Instant Digital simply claims that the effect is reduced on the new model.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation iPad Pro Details</h2><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">complete revamp</a> of its Magic Keyboard accessory for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that makes the device more laptop-like.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/11/m1-ipad-pro-magic-keyboards.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-795764" /><br/>
The updated version of the Magic Keyboard for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will apparently offer a larger trackpad, addressing criticisms of the current model, and "makes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> look even more like a laptop than the current setup." The area around the keyboard itself will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">made of aluminum</a>, resembling the top case of MacBooks, to provide a sturdier structure. The exterior shell of the keyboard will retain the silicone cover material used on the current model and a single USB-C port. Gurman mused that the redesign using more premium materials could lead Apple to raise the accessory's &#36;299 price point.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Instant Digital claims that the next-generation Magic Keyboard will also be 100% carbon neutral thanks to its redesign and use of different materials. Last month, Apple unveiled its first carbon neutral products: The aluminium <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> when paired with a new Sport Loop, as well as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> when paired with a new Trail Loop or Alpine Loop. The company plans for all of its products to be carbon neutral by 2030. <br/>
<br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are rumored to feature OLED displays, in a significant first for Apple's tablet lineup. Instant Digital added that Apple plans to use Samsung's Gen 6 OLED panel production lines to supply displays for the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. Chinese supplier BOE is also apparently still trying to obtain orders from Apple for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; OLED displays, and is currently trying to improve the quality and suitability of its panels. The devices are not expected to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/11-inch-13-inch-ipad-pro-oled-mid-2024/">until next year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Will New iPads Launch This Week?</h2><br/>
Instant Digital's discussion of the seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s features comes in anticipation of a new model that could be announced as soon as tomorrow. Last week, the Weibo user said that seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is among several devices that Apple could launch this month. A modified first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> with a USB-C connector instead of Lightning and the sixth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip are also apparently on the table for announcement toward the end of October. <br/>
<br/>
After evidence of a refreshed first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with a USB-C connector was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/ios-17-1-apple-pencil-usb-c/">discovered in iOS 17.1 beta code</a>, Instant Digital said that "Apple has not given up on the original &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, and a USB-C version is expected to be coming soon." The account has also recently discussed a third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; model.<br/>
<br/>
Over the weekend, multiple websites <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/mark-gurman-on-new-ipads-and-macs/">made independent claims</a> that Apple plans to announce updated &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, and entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models this week, citing sources. Instant Digital has been making claims about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october/">new iPad models set to launch this month</a> since early September.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223238155365&navType=by">post</a> on the Korean social media site Naver from a user with a track record for posting Apple rumors also shared information from a different <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223238155365&navType=by">Weibo user</a>, separate to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/mark-gurman-on-new-ipads-and-macs/">reporting over the weekend</a> about new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models being released this week, claiming that the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; models will be available starting this week.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these reports, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/mark-gurman-on-new-ipads-and-macs/">yesterday said</a> that new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, and entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models are all in development with faster chips, but believes they "won't happen this month." Similarly, Apple supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> recently remarked "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">new iPad models are unlikely before the year's end</a>." <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, a report from <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macotakara-jp/">Mac Otakara</a></em> yesterday claimed that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/15/apple-pencil-3-magnetic-tips-rumor/">third-generation Apple Pencil</a> with a replaceable magnetic tip is more likely to be announced instead of new iPads. Last month, the leaker known as "Majin Bu" said the new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; would feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">interchangeable magnetic tips</a> for drawing, technical drawing, and digital painting.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, the exact picture of what to expect this month is unclear. At the start of the month, <em>MacRumors</em> learned about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-mac-this-month/">imminent changes</a> to Apple's trade-in policies that could align with the launch of new products. Overall, the rumor mill is currently quite a mixed picture when it comes to details about new Apple product launches this month, but two things are for sure: Almost all of the chatter relates to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; accessories, and it will not be long before we know for sure whether Apple really is going to launch anything this month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/">Magic Keyboard</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/boe/">BOE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Setsuna Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">iPad Mini 7 Rumored to Feature These Four Upgrades</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades.2407749/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
