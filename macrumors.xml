		<description><![CDATA[Google Chrome will soon let you install any webpage as a desktop app on your Mac, just like Apple's Safari browser does in macOS Sonoma (via <em><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/any-website-pwa-chrome-124/">Android Police</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" /><br/>
The new feature was spotted by X (Twitter) user <a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1765698342191780066">Leopeva64</a> in the latest <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Chrome Canary</a> build, which includes a new option called "Install page as app," which can be found in Settings ➝ Save and share. Websites such as YouTube and Reddit which already have their own web apps will also automatically appear as optional installs in this menu.<br/>
<br/>
Selecting the "Install page as app" option invokes a prompt to "Install app," as shown in the image below. Web apps are automatically saved in an Applications subfolder called Chrome Canary Apps, where they can be optionally dragged to the Dock in macOS. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/chrome-web-apps.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940206" /><br/>
Currently, Chrome's implementation of web apps is more sophisticated than Safari's, as it provides not only a simplified toolbar with navigation buttons, but also a pared down settings menu with options including Copy URL, Open in Chrome, Uninstall, Zoom, Print, Find and Edit, and Cast.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/14/how-web-apps-work-macos-sonoma/">Here's How Web Apps Work in macOS Sonoma</a></li></ul><br/>
The feature is thanks to Chrome's long-standing support for <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/powerful-apps-fueled-by-the-web">Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</a>, which Google originally embraced as a replacement for Chrome apps on the Google Play store. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/chrome-web-app-2.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940208" /><br/>
Users can try out the feature before it goes live in the stable build of Chrome by downloading the latest <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Canary 124 update</a> and enabling two new flags. To do so, copy and paste the following links into the address bar:<br/>
<ul><li>chrome://flags/#web-app-universal-install</li><br/>
<li>chrome://flags/#shortcuts-not-apps</li></ul><br/>
Chrome 123 is currently in beta and is expected to be released to the public imminently, so PWA support for webpages won't be in the upcoming version, but the next stable build after that.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-chrome/">Google Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/google-chrome-desktop-web-apps/">Google Chrome Will Soon Let You Install Any Website as a Desktop App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-chrome-will-soon-let-you-install-any-website-as-a-desktop-app.2421386/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/retail/jingan/">announced</a> the imminent opening of its eighth retail store in central Shanghai, China, which will be named Apple Jing'an.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-store-jing-an-shanghai.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940196" /><br/>
Located on Nanjing West Road in the Jing'an District (named after its famous ancient Jing'an Temple), Apple Jing'an will become the 57th Apple store in mainland China. Local reports suggest it will be the second largest store in the city.<br/>
<br/>
Embracing a floral theme, the <a href="https://x.com/Edourdoo/status/1765962370537722150?s=20">storefront</a> is currently draped in a veil of blooming flowers. To celebrate the opening, Apple has also made a special wallpaper for Apple devices <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/jingan/images/wallpaper/Apple_JingAn_Wallpaper_Mac.jpg">available to download</a> on its China website.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet revealed when the store will begin to welcome customers, but local reports suggest it will open its doors later this month.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is currently grappling with a significant slump in demand for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales in the country, with a recent report by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/china-iphone-sales-slump-early-2024/">CounterPoint Research</a> suggesting &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales dropped by 24 percent in the first six weeks of 2024 alone.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/">Retail</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/apple-eighth-store-shanghai-opening/">Apple&#039;s Eighth Retail Store in Shanghai Expected to Open This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-eighth-retail-store-in-shanghai-expected-to-open-this-month.2421377/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has ordered an initial 8.5 million OLED display panels from South Korean suppliers for its upcoming redesigned iPad Pro models, which are expected to arrive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">as soon as this month</a>. The refresh will mark the biggest design update to the Pro lineup since 2018.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
Apple is relying on different OLED display suppliers for the upcoming ~11-inch and ~13-inch iPad Pro models, with Samsung Display exclusively producing ~11-inch panels and LG Display making the ~13-inch panels. Based on current orders, Samsung will produce 4 million units in 2024, while LG will make 4.5 million units for the year, perhaps suggesting that the larger model is forecast to be slightly more popular.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/apple-has-two-suppliers-for-oled-ipad-pro/">Industry insiders</a> claim the division of labor is due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for OLED iPad Pro models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to be aiming for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/oled-ipad-lightweight-design-and-image-quality/">"unrivaled" display quality</a>, as well as a design that cuts down on the thickness and weight of its ‌iPad Pro models. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/2024-ipad-pro-cad-drawings/">Recent leaked CAD drawings</a> of the upcoming models offer a better idea of just how thin the tablets will be. The larger ‌iPad Pro‌, for example, will be over 1mm thinner.<br/>
<br/>
The number of OLED panels Apple orders from Samsung and LG may change after production of the initial quantity, depending on fluctuations in production yield and possible adjustments to Apple's demand forecast for the new ‌OLED ‌iPad‌ Pro‌ models. Apple's latest shipments forecast is said to have been a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-planning-to-sell-fewer-oled-ipad-pros/">decrease</a> from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/oled-ipad-pro-price-lower-than-first-thought/">OLED iPad Pro Price Hikes May Be Lower Than Early Reports Suggested</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple's ‌iPad Pro‌ models are also expected to be upgraded with faster 3-nanometer M3 chips, and MagSafe charging is a possibility. Apple is also expected to sell the devices with a new Magic Keyboard and an upgraded Apple Pencil.

		<description><![CDATA[In addition to releasing the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-4/">macOS Sonoma 14.4 update</a> on Thursday, Apple also released a new version of its <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2105?locale=en_US">Windows Migration Assistant software</a> for PCs to include compatibility with the latest version of macOS.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/migration-assistant.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940183" /><br/>
Version 3.0.0.0 of the utility provides support for users looking to migrate their data from a PC running Windows 10 or later to Apple's latest Mac operating system. The assistant transfers users' contacts, calendars, email accounts, and more from a Windows machine and migrates the data to the appropriate places in macOS. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2080">Version 2.4.5.0</a> remains available for users whose Mac is running macOS Ventura, macOS Monterey, or a version of macOS Sonoma earlier than 14.4. Versions of Windows Migration Assistant for macOS Big Sur and earlier also remain available. The macOS version of Migration Assistant lives in the Applications/Utilities folder.<br/>
<br/>
Apple advises users to turn off any antivirus, firewall, or VPN software until the transfer of information is complete.

		<description><![CDATA[Like iPhones, iPads, Macs, the Apple Watch, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> are updated with new software on a regular basis. The most recent update was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-4/">released on March 7</a>, and enables <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> to learn what your preferred media service is. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/HomePod-2-and-HomePod-Mini.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-890072" /><br/>
By default, updates are installed on your &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; devices automatically, but there's also a way to force an update if new software is released. However, Apple's auto-update function isn't typically immediate, so it can sometimes be handy to have a way to manually install software when you know an update has become available.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/update-homepod-17.4.jpg" alt="home" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940180" /><br/>
Locating &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; updates and checking on the software version you have installed is pretty simple, but it's not entirely intuitive because the update function is buried in the Home app.<br/>
<br/>
The following steps show you how to update your &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; on devices running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> and later.<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Open the <strong>Home</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>Tap on the icon that looks like three dots in the upper right corner.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Home Settings</strong> in the dropdown menu that appears.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Software Update</strong> to see if there are any available updates.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Once you've selected "Software Update," you'll be able to see the current version of the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; software that you have installed, along with available updates, and you can toggle off automatic updates if you want.<br/>
<br/>
If there is an available update, you just need to tap the <strong>Install</strong> button to update your &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;. If you have multiple HomePods in your home, each one will be updated at the same time through this software update feature. If you're registered for &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; Beta Updates, a menu option will also appear here for updating individual HomePods.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/homepod-software-update/">How to Update to HomePod Software 17.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-update-to-homepod-software-17-4.2105572/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting today, Apple's refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models with M3 chips are available for same-day or next-day pickup at Apple Stores, with no pre-order required. Online orders are also beginning to arrive to customers today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/macbook-air-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939665" /><br/>
Customers across the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and other regions can now place an order on Apple's website or in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> app and arrange for in-store pickup at a local retail location.<br/>

To order a product with &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; pickup, add the product to your bag on Apple.com, proceed to checkout, select the "I'll pick it up" option, enter your ZIP code, choose an available &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; location, and select a pickup date. Payment is completed online, and a valid government-issued photo ID and the order number may be required upon pickup.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the M3 chip, the new 13-inch and 15-inch ‌&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models‌ offer Wi-Fi 6E, Voice Isolation and Wide Spectrum microphone modes, enhanced voice clarity in audio and video calls, and a more fingerprint-resistant finish with the Midnight color option. They also now support up to two external displays when the laptop lid is closed, increasing from just a single external display on the previous Apple silicon models.<br/>
<br/>
There are no major external design changes to the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models, which continue to be available in Midnight, Starlight, Space Gray, and Silver colors.

Introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">on Monday of this week</a>, the updated 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models are equipped with the same M3 chip that was introduced in the MacBook Pro late last year.<br/>

</ul><br/>
There are no external changes to the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, with Apple instead focusing on internal updates. The M3 chip is up to 30 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip in terms of CPU performance, and there are notable GPU improvements with Apple adding support for Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, hardware-accelerated mesh shading, and support for AV1 decode.<br/>
<br/>
Other improvements to the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; include support for two external displays when the machine is used in clamshell mode, support for Wi-Fi 6E, enhanced voice clarity for audio and video calls, and a new anodization seal to reduce fingerprints on the Midnight finish.<br/>
<br/>
Apple retail stores in Australia are selling the new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; machines, and there is plenty of stock for walk-in customers. Apple does not operate stores in New Zealand, so customers in that country need to order online.<br/>
<br/>
Following New Zealand and Australia, sales and deliveries of the new ‌&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models will launch in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be sharing a hands-on review of the new M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; in the morning after picking up one of the new devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/m3-macbook-air-new-zealand-australia/">M3 MacBook Air Models Now Arriving to Customers in New Zealand and Australia</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-macbook-air-models-now-arriving-to-customers-in-new-zealand-and-australia.2421330/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models that are set to be released tomorrow will have a day-one update, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/macbook-air-blue-image.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937843" /><br/>
Both the 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models that are set to launch tomorrow are running a special build of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.3, with a version number of 23D2057.<br/>
<br/>
Users will be prompted to update to &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4 tomorrow, as the software saw a public release today. Given the timing of the software's launch and the debut of the new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models, Apple was not able to get the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4 update installed on them.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models are priced starting at &#36;1099 for the 13-inch version and &#36;1299 for the 15-inch version. Customers who pre-ordered will receive their machines on March 8, which is also when the new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models will be available in Apple retail locations.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/macbook-air-day-one-macos-update/">New M3 MacBook Air Models to Have Day-One macOS Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-m3-macbook-air-models-to-have-day-one-macos-update.2421325/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Developing New Accessibility Features for iOS 18 and macOS 15</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With every operating system release, Apple aims to make apps more accessible and easier to navigate by providing a variety of new accessibility features and settings. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> (Codename Crystal) and macOS 15 (Codename Glow) will be no exception, and work on accessibility-related enhancements is well underway.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-18-Roundup-Article.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924585" /><br/>
Through our industry sources, <em>MacRumors</em> has obtained information on some of the key accessibility improvements Apple has in store for its userbase. Apple is working on several new accessibility features along with improvements to existing settings, both of which should be available later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Adaptive Voice Shortcuts</h2><br/>
This feature will allow users to map a unique spoken phrase to an accessibility setting. Users will be given the option to create a custom phrase and select the accessibility setting they wish to toggle by speaking said phrase. By using Adaptive Voice Shortcuts, users will be able to toggle existing accessibility features such as VoiceOver, Voice Control, Zoom and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New "Categories" Section for Live Speech</h2><br/>
The Live Speech feature, which is already present in Apple's operating systems, will receive a new section for user-created categories. Users will be able to organize phrases into categories of their choosing. When creating a category, users will be given the option to name their category and choose from a selection of around 20 different icons. Once a category has been created, users will then be able to add their desired phrases.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Apps Will Support Custom Font Sizes</h2><br/>
Apple intends to expand app support for adjustable Text Size, which is an existing feature. Located within the "Display" section of the "Accessibility" settings pane, the option allows users to choose custom font sizes for individual apps and select their preferred font size for reading.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> currently supports custom font sizes for the following five apps:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Calendar<br/>
<li>Finder<br/>
<li>Mail<br/>
<li>Messages<br/>
<li>Notes</ul><br/>
<br/>
With macOS 15, this feature will expand support to five additional apps:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Books<br/>
<li>News<br/>
<li>Stocks<br/>
<li>Tips<br/>
<li>Weather</ul><br/>
<br/>
Speaking to <em>MacRumors</em>, sources familiar with custom font sizes have said that Apple is internally testing an option to alter the font size of the menu bar within macOS, but it is unclear if the company will make this option available to end users. We were also told that Apple has additional accessibility features in the works, one of which utilizes on-device eye tracking, though further details were not available at the time of writing. More information should come to light as OS development continues in preparation for WWDC 2024.<br/>
<br/>
It is important to note that while these features are in development, it does not necessarily mean we will see them later this year. Apple has been known to cancel various projects that do not meet their standards, for one reason or another.

		<title>Apple to Let EU iPhone Users Delete Safari and More Easily Transition to Android</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In addition to adding support for alternative app marketplaces and alternative payment methods in the European Union, Apple is making several other changes to comply with the terms of the Digital Markets Act. Apple today outlined some of its upcoming plans in a DMA Compliance Report [<a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/dma/dma-ncs.pdf">PDF</a>].<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/transfer-to-android.jpg" alt="" width="1240" height="698" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940141" /><br/>
Apple is going to make it easier for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to switch over to another operating system in the European Union. Apple says it is working on a solution that will help mobile operating system providers create "more user-friendly solutions" for transferring data from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to a non-Apple phone. The solution will be available by fall 2025, after which point companies like Samsung and Google will be able to offer better tools for transferring data from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
EU &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users will be able to remove Safari from their devices entirely starting at the end of 2024, with an alternate browser able to take the place of Safari. As part of this plan, Apple is developing a browser switching solution for exporting and importing browser data into another browser on the same device. Apple has already began supporting alternative web browser engines, another DMA requirement.<br/>
<br/>
To improve interoperability between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and other smartphone platforms, Apple is allowing third-party payment apps to access the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s NFC chip for contactless payments that are not done through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, plus it is allowing developers to submit requests for additional interoperability.<br/>
<br/>
Interoperability requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they are under the scope of the DMA, and if an effective interoperability solution can be developed.<br/>
<br/>
Developers in the EU are able to <a href="https://www.cedr.com">request additional mediation</a> that goes beyond the standard App Review Board evaluation. Developers who want to contest unsuccessful appeals to the App Review Board can request mediation, a process that Apple says is "EU-based, easily accessible, impartial, independent, and free-of-charge."<br/>
<br/>
All of these changes are limited to developers and users in the European Union as they are required by the Digital Markets Act.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-eu-safari-android-changes/">Apple to Let EU iPhone Users Delete Safari and More Easily Transition to Android</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-let-eu-iphone-users-delete-safari-and-more-easily-transition-to-android.2421315/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912513" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/watchOS-10-Launch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" /><br/>
‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌‌.4 can be downloaded for free through the Apple Watch app on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or later by opening it up and going to General &amp; Software Update. To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery and it needs to be placed on a charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.4 adds support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-adds-new-emoji/">new emoji characters</a> that were also added to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, including lime, edible brown mushroom, phoenix, broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).<br/>
<br/>
There is also a Setting to disable the Double Tap feature on Apple Watch when using Vision Pro, and an option to double tap to show an expanded notification.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new software for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, debuting &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; Software 17.4. The update comes over a month after the last &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; software release.<br/>
<br/>

With &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; Software 17.4, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is able to learn what a user's preferred media service is, eliminating the need to set a third-party app as the default or include an app name when asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to play content.<blockquote>This update enables Siri to learn your preferred media service, so you no longer need to include the name of the media app in your request.</blockquote>Apple has removed the Home app option that let users select a default media service as a result of the new feature addition. The change brings the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; in line with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, which already offer the option to provide a default music service selection to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; when making a song request for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Third-party apps that work directly with the ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌ include YouTube Music, Deezer, Pandora, TuneIn, and iHeartRadio. Streaming music services need to support ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌ for the feature to work, and not all do, such as Spotify. You can play Spotify content on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; by asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, but it routes the song through the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Along with ‌&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌ support for a preferred music service, the ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌ 17.4 update also includes performance and stability improvements.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-4/">Apple Releases HomePod Software 17.4 With Music Preference Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-4-with-music-preference-update.2421308/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released tvOS 17.4, the fourth major update to the tvOS 17 operating system that came out last September. tvOS 17.4 comes over a month after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-releases-tvos-17-3/">release of tvOS 17.3</a>.<br/>
<br/>

tvOS 17.4 can be downloaded using the Settings app on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>‌. Go to System &gt; Software Update to get the new software. ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ owners who have automatic software updates activated will be upgraded to tvOS 17.4 automatically.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to other operating system updates, tvOS 17.4 updates are often minor in scale, focusing on bug fixes and other small improvements. We did not find new features during the tvOS 17.4 beta testing process.<br/>
<br/>

		<title>iOS Apps From Alternative Marketplaces Can Be Updated for 30 Days Outside of EU</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118110">today clarified</a> that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the European Union can continue to update and use apps from alternative app marketplaces for a 30-day period when leaving the EU.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
With the release of iOS 17.4, Apple published a number of support documents, and one of the pages <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/alternative-ios-app-stores-eu-grace-period/">outlined what happens</a> when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user with apps installed through an alternative app marketplace leaves the EU. At the time, the document said that there would be an unspecified "grace period," but Apple has now updated it to provide exact timing.<br/>
<br/>
EU &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who travel outside of the area can expect to be able to update apps installed through alternative app marketplaces for a 30-day period, but after that, apps will not be able to be updated.<br/>
<br/>
Installing alternative app marketplaces and the apps in those marketplaces is restricted to the European Union at all times, so travelers will not be able to install new apps through a marketplace while out of their home country or one of the 27 countries in the EU. Apps that have been downloaded can continue to be opened and used, even if they can't be updated.<blockquote>If you leave the European Union, you can continue to open and use apps that you previously installed from alternative app marketplaces. Alternative app marketplaces can continue updating those apps for up to 30 days after you leave the European Union, and you can continue using alternative app marketplaces to manage previously installed apps. However, you must be in the European Union to install alternative app marketplaces and new apps from alternative app marketplaces.</blockquote><br/>
Apple makes it clear that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who want to install apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> must be physically located in a country in the European Union and their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> must also be set to a country or region in the EU. Apple uses privacy-focused on-device processing to determine whether a user is eligible to install an alternative app marketplace.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/alternative-apps-30-day-update-period/">iOS Apps From Alternative Marketplaces Can Be Updated for 30 Days Outside of EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-apps-from-alternative-marketplaces-can-be-updated-for-30-days-outside-of-eu.2421304/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
