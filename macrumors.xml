		<description><![CDATA[Apple will unveil its new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup in a range of new colors later this year in the fall. Here are all the rumored colors so far for the four models: &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935160" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</h2><br/>
In the last few years, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>‌ lineups have launched with five color options. This year, however, Apple could buck that trend for the 6.1-inch &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 6.7-inch &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. At least one of the standard models will come in more color options than ever before, claims one rumor.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Weibo-based leaker "Fixed focus digital," Apple's upcoming larger 6.7-inch &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus model will come in as many as seven colors that either build upon the existing five colors in the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, or recast them in a new finish.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-16-Lozenge-2-Isolated-Colors.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949017" /><br/>
The following table shows the existing &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus color options alongside the colors rumored for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus:<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>

 </tr><br/>
<tr><br/>
 <td>–</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Purple</strong></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
The leaker in question did not provide any more context for the rumor beyond the model name, therefore it is not clear if they are claiming that the seven color options are exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the leaker may have only seen materials for the larger device in the supply chain, in which case the same colors could also be coming to the smaller 6.1-inch &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. Given that the two models are expected to be identical apart from their size difference, this possibility seems the most likely. <br/>
<br/>
Note that this is the first rumor we have received about potential colors for the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, and the leaker has an unproven track record for accurate leaks, so the alleged colors need corroboration from other sources before we can definitively say they are coming. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911423" /><br/>
Apple typically chooses four, cooler-toned colors for its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pro models. For last year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, for example, Apple introduced a titanium chassis that came in four muted finishes: Natural Titanium, Blue Titanium, White Titanium, and Black Titanium.  <br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1772522408144191732?s=20">one rumor out of China</a>, the existing Blue Titanium color will be dropped from the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; lineup in favor of a new "rose" titanium color, while Black Titanium will allegedly be replaced with a "space black" color, which is said to be similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro color of the same name.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-16-pro-colors-rumor.jpeg" alt="" width="1386" height="2048" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943306" /><br/>
Additionally, the same source claims that the Natural and White Titanium colors will be slightly different on the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models. Natural Titanium is said to be returning, but with more of a gray tint to it. Meanwhile, White Titanium will appear more like a "silver white" color, which is also said to be similar to the silver version of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple surprised some &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; fans by not offering a gold option. Gold was available through the ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌ 5S to the ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌ 8, and then on the ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌ XS to the ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌‌ Pro. Given the popularity of gold, the rumored new "rose" color could well be the titanium version of a gold-like shade.<br/>
<br/>
According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-16-pro-two-new-color-options/">rumor from another source</a>, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will be available in "Desert Titanium" and "Titanium Gray" color options. These names suggest there could be some overlap with the separately rumored rose color and the tweaked Natural Titanium.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iphone-16-pro-colors-graybg.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937186" /><br/>
In another twist, a recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/">rumor out of Korea</a> claimed that Apple's upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will use an improved process for finishing and coloring titanium.  According to the source, the new process will make the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;‌ and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max look more polished than the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, which have a brushed finish.<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; (2023)</th><br/>
 <th>&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; (2024)</th><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td>Natural Titanium</td><br/>
 <td>Natural Titanium</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td>Blue Titanium</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Rose / Desert Titanium</strong></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
<tr><br/>
 <td>White Titanium</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Silver / White Titanium</strong></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td>Black Titanium</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Space Black Titanium</strong></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
The improved manufacturing process will allegedly result in a glossy appearance that is more akin to the heavily polished stainless steel material used in earlier Pro devices before the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; series. However, the new titanium finish will be less prone to scratches compared to stainless steel.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Summing Up</h2><br/>
As of writing this, we are still around five months away from Apple announcing the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; series, so a lot can change in the meantime, and we could see additional rumors that corroborate or conflict with those we have uncovered so far. Either way, we will keep this article up-to-date with any subsequent developments, so be sure to check back.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It's an iPhone 17 rumor frenzy this week courtesy of Jeff Pu, an analyst who has sources within Apple's supply chain in Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-17-Pro-Max-Smaller-Dynamic-Island-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949323" /><br/>
While the iPhone 16 lineup is still months away from being announced, rumors about the two-generations-away iPhone lineup typically begin to surface about a year-and-a-half before launch. For example, almost exactly a year ago, we learned that the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">will have larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>12GB of RAM</h2><br/>
In a research note with investment firm Haitong, Pu said the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will be equipped with 12GB of RAM. For comparison, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-models-have-8gb-ram/">iPhone 15 Pro models have 8GB of RAM</a>, and the iPhone 16 Pro models are also expected to have 8GB of RAM. The increase would contribute to improved performance for multitasking on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
The alleged RAM amounts across the iPhone 17 lineup:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>iPhone 17:</strong> 8GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 17 Slim:</strong> 8GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro:</strong> 12GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max:</strong> 12GB</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
How that compares to the iPhone 15 lineup:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> 6GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Plus:</strong> 6GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro:</strong> 8GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max:</strong> 8GB</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Narrower Dynamic Island on Pro Max</h2><br/>
Pu said the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a "much narrowed Dynamic Island" as a result of the device adopting a smaller "metalens" for the Face ID system.<br/>
<br/>
This would be the first size reduction for the Dynamic Island since its iPhone 14 Pro debut.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">iPhone 17 Pro Rumors: 12GB RAM, Narrower Dynamic Island for Pro Max</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-rumors-12gb-ram-narrower-dynamic-island-for-pro-max.2425558/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Reportedly Building M2 Ultra and M4-Powered AI Servers</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has started building its own AI servers that use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Ultra chip, Haitong analyst Jeff Pu reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-947745" /><br/>
Pu provided the analysis based on supply chain checks in a new note to investors seen by <em>MacRumors</em>. Foxconn is said to currently be assembling Apple AI servers that contain the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra, with plans to assemble AI servers powered by the M4 chip in late 2025. Last month, a reputable source on Weibo said that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/">working on processors for its own AI servers</a> made with TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process, targeting mass production by the second half of 2025, which may line up with this report about M4-powered AI servers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to build its own AI server is reflective of the company's ongoing strategy to vertically integrate its supply chain. Apple will likely use its own chips to enhance the performance of its data centers and future AI tools that rely on the cloud.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple is rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-acquires-french-ai-company/">prioritizing on-device processing</a> for many of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-working-on-on-device-llm/">upcoming AI tools</a>, it is inevitable that some operations will have to occur in the cloud. By the time M4-based servers could be operational in data centers, Apple's new AI strategy should be well underway. <br/>
<br/>
In line with broader industry expectations, Pu also expects Apple to announce on-device AI features at WWDC in June, such as audio recording summarization, photo and video editing, and live translation. While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup will tout a range of AI features, 2025's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 models will apparently be more focused AI devices.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/">Foxconn</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/">Apple Reportedly Building M2 Ultra and M4-Powered AI Servers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-powered-ai-servers.2425557/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's first foldable devices will reach mass production in 2025 and 2026, according to Haitong analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="820" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-797663" /><br/>
In a note to investors seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said that foldable devices are increasingly visible in Apple's supply chain with accelerating progress. The company is expected to release a large-screen foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> or MacBook to kick-off its foray into the product category before launching a higher volume foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
One Apple foldable with a 20.3-inch display will apparently start production in late 2025, which is sooner than previously expected. This time frame is said to be supported by information from Korean display makers, as well as American and Taiwanese hinge manufacturers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">foldable iPhone</a> will allegedly feature a 7.9-inch or 8.3-inch display. The company may launch two foldables with these two display size options, or it may opt for a single display size option only. The foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; could form a new ultra-high end smartphone line for Apple. The device is currently scheduled to reach mass production late 2026, a year after the 20.3-inch foldable.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/first-apple-foldable-coming-in-2025/">Report: Apple&#039;s First Foldables Coming in 2025 and 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apples-first-foldables-coming-in-2025-and-2026.2425554/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you sometimes struggle to maintain focus while you're working, or find it difficult to unwind and relax at the end of the day? Believe it or not, your iPhone could help with that. Keep reading to learn how.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/airpods-pro-adaptive-audio.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="447" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912251" /><br/>
If you are looking to minimize distractions when you focus on something, or just want to zone out after a hard day's work, it's well worth checking out the Background Sounds feature on your iPhone or iPad. Whether you are at home or in a public place, you can play calming sounds with just a few taps on your device to help you concentrate or rest.<br/>
<br/>
In iOS and iPadOS, Apple's Background Sounds include balanced, bright, and dark noise, as well as natural sounds like ocean, rain, and stream. All of the sounds can be set to play in the background to mask unwanted environmental or external noise, and the sounds mix into or duck under other audio and system sounds, so you don't have to drown out what's important to you.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Enable Background Sounds on iPhone and iPad</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone or iPad.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under "Hearing," tap <strong>Audio & Visual</strong>.<br/>

<li>Tap <strong>Sound</strong> to choose a sound effect. Choose from <strong>Balanced Noise</strong>, <strong>Bright Noise</strong>, <strong>Dark Noise</strong>, <strong>Ocean</strong>, <strong>Rain</strong>, and <strong>Stream</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/2background-sounds-ios.jpg" alt="settings" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949252" /></ol>Your device will need to download individual sound effects when you play them for the first time, so make sure you have an internet connection, but after that you can play the background sound wherever you are. <br/>
<br/>
Note that the last screen in the steps optionally lets you set the volume of the sound, and includes an additional option to automatically stop the sound when you lock your device.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Accessibility Shortcut Access</h2><br/>
Once you have downloaded the background sounds, you can quickly start and stop the audio via an Accessibility Shortcut. Here's how to set one up.<br/>
<h2>Set Up the Accessibility Shortcut</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Tap through to <b>Settings ➝ Accessibility</b>.</li><br/>
<li>Select <b>Accessibility Shortcut</b> near the bottom of the menu.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Background Sounds</strong> to select it. You can also drag the three lines icon at the far right to change the order in which it appears in the shortcuts menu.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/accessibility-shortcut.jpg" alt="settings" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949291" /><br/>
<br/>
You can triple click your iPhone's Side button to access the Accessibility Shortcut at any time. Alternatively, you can add an Accessibility Shortcut button to your device's Control Center in the following way.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Access Accessibility Shortcut</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Tap through to <strong>Settings ➝ Control Center.</strong></li><br/>
<li>Find <strong>Accessibility Shortcuts</strong> under the "More Controls" list and then tap the entry to include it in Control Center.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/1background-sounds-control-center-ios.jpg" alt="settings" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949297" /><br/>
Once that's done, swipe from the top-right corner of your screen to bring up Control Center, then simply tap <strong>Accessibility Shortcut</strong> button and then tap Background Sounds to turn the audio on or off.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/2background-sounds-control-center-ios.jpg" alt="settings" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949296" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 Plus or "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Slim" will feature a 6.55-inch display, according to Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912514" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/dsccross/status/1787509002668286193?s=46&t=7hGG_t1VNNuDJze42Vj_-w">post to subscribers</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Young added to a report first shared yesterday by Haitong International Securities Jeff Pu. Pu claimed that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Plus, rumored to launch in 2025, could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">replaced by an "iPhone 17 Slim."</a><br/>
<br/>
Pu said that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Slim will feature a 6.6-inch display, which is a slight reduction on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, 15, and 16 Plus, which feature a 6.69-inch OLED display. Now, Young has clarified that the device will feature a 6.55-inch display.  This is a reduction of two percent over the previous, current, and next-generation models.<br/>
<br/>
A smaller display would help differentiate the larger &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 model from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro Max, while remaining larger than the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 Pro, which are expected to feature 6.1- and 6.3-inch displays, respectively.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/">Ross Young</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">&#039;iPhone 17 Slim&#039; Said to Feature 6.55-Inch Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-slim-said-to-feature-6-55-inch-display.2425547/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the iPhone 16 series is still months away from launching, an early rumor about an all-new iPhone 17 model has now surfaced.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Colors-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911674" /><br/>
In a research note with investment firm Haitong this week, analyst Jeff Pu said Apple is planning a so-called "iPhone 17 Slim" model that would replace the Plus model in the lineup. Pu said this model will feature around a 6.6-inch display, a slimmer design, an A18 or A19 chip, 8GB of RAM, a 24-megapixel front camera, and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera.<br/>
<br/>
More specifically, display industry analyst Ross Young said this iPhone 17 model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">will have a 6.55-inch display</a>. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Plus has a 6.7-inch display.<br/>
<br/>
Pu expects the iPhone 17 Slim to have an aluminum chassis, rather than a titanium casing like the Pro models. He expects the device to have some external design changes, but he did not share any specific details.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 lineup in September 2025, so some of these reported features could change.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">&#039;iPhone 17 Slim&#039; With Smaller Display Rumored to Launch Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-slim-with-smaller-display-rumored-to-launch-next-year.2425546/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A reference to an unreleased "Apple Pencil Pro" has been <a href="https://twitter.com/ribu_ap712/status/1787461116211479032">spotted in the source code</a> for Apple's homepage in Japan. We have independently confirmed that the code exists, but it would be unsurprising if Apple removes it after it was discovered.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Pencil-on-iPad-Close.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939788" /><br/>
This finding suggests that an Apple Pencil Pro could be announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-let-loose-apple-event-may-7/">at the Apple Event tomorrow</a>. However, given the code does not appear on Apple's homepage in the U.S. or other countries, there is a chance that the Japanese website made a translation error.<br/>
<br/>
A computer translation of the source code:<blockquote>Folded green, yellow, orange and blue paper forms the Apple logo. Inside the logo, you can see the creator's hand holding the Apple Pencil Pro and drawing.</blockquote>Regardless of whether the Apple Pencil Pro name is used, a new Apple Pencil is expected to be announced at the Apple Event. Rumored features include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">new "squeeze" gesture</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">haptic feedback</a>, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-pencil-visionon-support-in-testing/">Vision Pro support is also a possibility</a> by visionOS 2.<br/>
<br/>
It is likely that the Apple Pencil Pro would replace the second-generation Apple Pencil, released in 2018. Other models available include the Apple Pencil with USB-C, and the original Apple Pencil from 2015, which is expected to be discontinued once Apple stops selling the ninth-generation iPad with a Lightning connector.<br/>
<br/>
Other products expected to be announced at the Apple Event include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">two new iPad Pro models with Apple's next-generation M4 chip</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/">a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> to go along with an updated 10.9-inch model, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">redesigned Magic Keyboard for iPads</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-pencil-pro/">&#039;Apple Pencil Pro&#039; Referenced in Code on Apple&#039;s Website in Japan</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-pro-referenced-in-code-on-apples-website-in-japan.2425538/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated Apple.com with a teaser for tomorrow's event, adding an interactive erasing feature that seems to hint at a refreshed version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-event-erase-graphic.jpg" alt="" width="2112" height="1188" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949256" /><br/>
Hovering over the Apple logo and moving the mouse allows the current artwork to be erased and replaced with a new logo design. Apple created a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-has-six-artistic-logos/">total of six logos</a> for the May 7 "Let Loose" event, and the interactive eraser cycles through those options.<br/>
<br/>
The event is expected to focus on new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, but rumors suggest the iPads will also be accompanied by an overhauled &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and a refreshed version of the Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">Code in iOS 17.5</a> mentions an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with a "squeeze" gesture, so it is possible that the new model that's coming will have a hardware-based erase option enabled with a squeeze. The current &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models do not have a universal erase feature that works across apps, and adding such an option would likely be popular with users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-homepage-erasable-logo/">Erasable Logo on Apple&#039;s Homepage Hints at New Apple Pencil Coming Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/erasable-logo-on-apples-homepage-hints-at-new-apple-pencil-coming-tomorrow.2425535/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that iOS 17.5 will be released to the public "soon," following over a month of beta testing. While the software update is relatively minor, it does have a few new features and changes, as outlined in the list below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17-All-New-Features-Thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912155" /><br/>
"The new Pride Radiance watch face and iPhone and iPad wallpapers will be available soon with watchOS 10.5, iOS 17.5, and iPadOS 17.5," said Apple, in its press release introducing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-unveils-2024-pride-edition-band/">new Pride Edition band for the Apple Watch</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we have recapped everything new in the iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 betas so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Web Distribution</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-ios-app-store-safari-changes.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933983" /><br/>
Starting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/ios-17-5-app-web-downloads-eu/">with the second beta of iOS 17.5</a>, eligible developers are able to distribute their iOS apps to iPhone users located in the EU directly on the web, instead of through the App Store or an alternative app marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
"Web Distribution" is limited to larger developers based in the EU. To qualify for this distribution method, Apple says the developer must be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more, and have an app that had more than one million annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
"Web Distribution" builds upon the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">alternative app marketplaces</a> that Apple already allows on the iPhone in the EU starting with iOS 17.4. Apple has made these app-related changes to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Quartiles</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-17.5-Quartiles-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945719" /><br/>
iOS 17.5 includes a fun addition for Apple News+ subscribers: a daily word game called Quartiles.<br/>
<br/>
Quartiles tasks you with combining tiles to form words and earn points. Each puzzle starts with a grid of 20 tiles, and words can be formed with one to four tiles. A quartile is a four-tile word, and if you find all five in each puzzle, you earn a 40-point bonus. The website <em>Gadget Hacks</em> shared a <a href="https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/apple-has-killer-new-word-game-puzzle-called-quartiles-hiding-ios-17-5-0385513/">walkthrough of the game</a> with more details.<br/>
<br/>
Quartiles is the third puzzle game included with an Apple News+ subscription, alongside Crossword and Crossword Mini. Starting with the iOS 17.5 beta, all three games integrate with Game Center to display leaderboards.<br/>
<br/>
On an iPhone updated to the iOS 17.5 beta, Quartiles can be found in the Apple News app under the Following tab → Puzzles. The game is also available on the iPad and Mac starting with the iPadOS 17.5 and macOS 14.5 betas.<br/>
<br/>
Apple News+ is available in the U.S., Australia, Canada, and the U.K., but the puzzle games seem to be limited to the U.S. and Canada for now.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Repair Mode</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ios-17-5-repair-state.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948810" /><br/>
iOS 17.5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-17-5-repair-state/">introduces a "Repair State" option</a> that lets an ‌iPhone‌ be sent in for service without deactivating Find My and Activation Lock.<br/>

<h2>Color-Changing Apple Podcasts Widget</h2><br/>
While listening to a podcast on the iOS 17.5 beta, the background color of the Apple Podcasts widget changes to match the podcast's cover art. This feature was first added in the iOS 17.4 beta, but it was removed before that update was released.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Color-changing Apple Podcasts widget is back in iOS 17.5! <a href="https://t.co/2PonD5FMi6">pic.twitter.com/2PonD5FMi6</a></p>&mdash; Stephen Robles (@stephenrobles) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenrobles/status/1775223262751977723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<h2>Mobile Device Management</h2><br/>
<br/>
As noted <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1775273274039259349">by Aaron Perris</a>, MDM solutions can enforce an iOS beta version during Automated Device Enrollment starting with the iOS 17.5 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Code Changes</h2><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Battery Health Menu for Future iPads</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPad-Battery-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1990" height="1120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944716" /><br/>
The first iPadOS 17.5 beta added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/">several new references to a Battery Health menu on the iPad</a>, but the feature is not actually visible yet. The menu is expected to show an iPad battery's maximum remaining capacity and charge cycle count.<br/>
<br/>
A sample of the code strings added in the iPadOS 17.5 beta:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>"iPad must be regularly used while not connected to power to show maximum capacity."</li><br/>
<li>"This is the number of times iPad has used your battery's capacity."</li><br/>
<li>"The iPad battery is performing as expected."</li><br/>
<li>"iPad batteries, like all rechargeable batteries, have a limited lifespan and may eventually need to be serviced or replaced."</li><br/>
<li>"The original battery was designed to retain X capacity at X cycles under ideal conditions. Actual battery performance depends on a number of variables, including how iPad is used and charged regularly. The one-year warranty includes service for defective batteries in addition to rights provided under local consumer laws."</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
There is no visible Battery Health menu on any existing iPad models running the iPadOS 17.5 beta, leading us to believe that the menu may be limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">new iPad Pro and iPad Air models that are expected to launch this month</a>, and likely other new iPads released in the future. Apple has shown battery capacity information on iPhones for many years, but cycle count information is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-shows-battery-cycle-count/">limited to the latest iPhone 15 series</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New Apple Pencil</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-pencil.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939786" /><br/>
In the iPadOS 17.5 beta, there are potential references to a new fourth-generation Apple Pencil, amid rumors that the accessory will be updated soon.<br/>
<br/>
The beta includes a hidden code reference to a "V4" version of the Apple Pencil:<blockquote>NumberOfApplePencilV1ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV2ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV3ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV4ConnectionsCount</blockquote>A new Apple Pencil is rumored to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">alongside updated iPad Pro and iPad Air models this month</a>. Apple refers to the USB-C version of the Apple Pencil released last year as the third-generation Apple Pencil in iOS code, so the fourth-generation model would be a new version that would likely succeed the second-generation Apple Pencil.<br/>
<br/>
Additional code in the iOS 17.5 beta suggests that the Apple Pencil could gain a "squeeze" gesture for certain actions, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">haptic feedback is also expected</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Third-Party Item Tracker Alerts</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/AirTag-and-iPhone-Notification-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1082" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894205" /><br/>
Apple and Google last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/apple-to-expand-unwanted-tracking-alerts/">jointly announced</a> a proposed industry specification to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth item trackers for unwanted tracking of individuals. As part of this initiative, Apple promised to expand AirTag-like "Found Moving With You" alerts to third-party item trackers in a future software update, which turns out to be iOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
The first iOS 17.5 beta added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-third-party-item-tracker-alerts/">references to alerts for third-party item trackers</a>. For example: "You can disable this item and stop it from sharing its location with the owner. To do this, follow the instructions provided on a website by the manufacturer of this item."<br/>
<br/>
Tile, Chipolo, Samsung, Eufy, and Pebblebee all expressed support for the industry specification, according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-google-partner-on-an-industry-specification-to-address-unwanted-tracking/">Apple's announcement</a> last year.<br/>
<br/>
In related news, Google launched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/08/google-android-find-my-device-network-2/">its own Find My Device network</a> last month.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Block All Participants in Group FaceTime Calls</h3><br/>
iOS 17.5 beta code indicates that there may be a new "Block All Participants" option for group FaceTime calls, which could help users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/group-facetime-spam-calls/">fight spam</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-says-ios-17-5-coming-soon/">Apple Says iOS 17.5 Coming &#039;Soon&#039; With These New Features for iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-ios-17-5-coming-soon-with-these-new-features-for-iphones.2425530/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apples-2024-pride-collection-shines-light-on-lgbtq-plus-communities/">announced</a> a new Pride Edition Braided Solo Loop Apple Watch band, watch face, and wallpaper.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/2024-Apple-Watch-Pride-Face-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949207" /><br/>
The band features a fluorescent design inspired by multiple pride flags with a laser-etched lug that reads "PRIDE 2024." Black, Hispanic, and Latin communities, as well as those impacted by HIV/AIDS, are represented on the band by the black and brown colors, while transgender and non-binary individuals and represented by the pink, light blue, and white colors.<br/>
<br/>
The band is accompanied by a new Pride Radiance watch face and wallpaper for iOS and iPadOS, in which beams of light glow against a dark background and stack on top of each other. On the Apple Watch, the colors trace each numeral of the watch face and react in real time as the wearer moves their wrist based on gyroscope input. On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, beams of color spell out "Pride" and dynamically move when the user unlocks the device. For the first time, the Pride watch face and wallpapers can be customized to show specific colors representing LGBTQ+ communities. <br/>
<br/>
The new braided Solo Loop will be available starting May 22. The new Pride Radiance watch face and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; wallpaper will be available "soon" with the release of watchOS 10.5, iOS 17.5, and iPadOS 17.5.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-bands/">Apple Watch Bands</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-unveils-2024-pride-edition-band/">Apple Unveils 2024 Pride Edition Braided Solo Loop Band and Watch Face</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-unveils-2024-pride-edition-braided-solo-loop-band-and-watch-face.2425521/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will hold its first media event of 2024 on Tuesday, May 7, at 7:00 a.m. Pacific Time through a live stream. Titled "Let Loose," the event is expected to see the unveiling of new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, along with updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> and Magic Keyboard accessories.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O7X1Lkphuo?si=9ySVCB5lA5woQjwK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
There are several ways to watch the May 7 event, with details listed below. We've also included a useful guide on when the event will take place in your particular time zone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Events Website</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events website</a>, you can watch the event live on a Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, PC, or any other device with a web browser. The Apple Events website works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and other main browsers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-events-website-let-loose.jpg" alt="" width="2532" height="1520" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947886" /><br/>
Just navigate to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">www.apple.com/apple-events/</a> using a web browser at the appropriate time to watch. You can visit the site now to add an event reminder to your calendar.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>YouTube</h2><br/>
Apple also plans to stream the event live on YouTube, which is perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to watch because the YouTube live stream can be viewed on every platform where YouTube is available, which is pretty much all platforms, from smartphones and tablets to consoles and smart TVs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1J38FlDKxo?si=bcebV5JQN1S1ySNw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Apple has posted a placeholder for the May 7 event on YouTube, and you can visit it now to set an event reminder through YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV App</h2><br/>
Apple used to have a dedicated Apple Events app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, but ahead of WWDC in June 2020, it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/18/events-app-apple-tv-app-wwdc/">folded into the Apple TV app</a>. On event day, there will be a prominent &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app section dedicated to the live stream, which can be watched on any device where the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app is available.<br/>
<br/>
This includes the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, iPhones, iPads, Macs, and some smart TVs. If you have an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app is one of the best ways to watch the event live. Apple hasn't updated the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app with the new event as of yet, but it should be added soon.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Event Time Zones</h2><br/>
Apple's "Let Loose" event will take place at 7:00 a.m. Pacific Time, which is an earlier start than usual, so keep that in mind if you're used to operating on Apple's more traditional event schedule. Event times in other time zones are listed below.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It's been a long time since the last one, but an Apple event is finally right around the corner! While it's anticipated to be a fairly short pre-recorded affair, we're expecting to see the first updates to the iPad lineup in over a year and half, so make sure to tune in to see what Apple has in store.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/top-stories-4may2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949129" /><br/>
Other news and rumors this week included a couple of product introductions from Apple's Beats brand, a roundup of rumors about updates to Apple's stock apps coming in iOS 18, and more changes to Apple's policies in the EU related to the Digital Markets Act, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What to Expect From the May 7 Apple Event</h2><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">first event of 2024 kicks off on Tuesday, May 7,</a> at 7 a.m. Pacific Time, and we've <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/what-to-expect-may-7-event/">put together our usual pre-event guide</a> outlining what we're expecting to see on Tuesday. Several new products are expected to be unveiled, including two new iPad Pro models, two new iPad Air models, an updated Apple Pencil, and a redesigned Magic Keyboard for iPads.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Let-Loose-Event-What-to-Expect-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949123" /><br/>
One rumor was particularly surprising this week, as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said there is a "strong possibility" that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">new iPad Pro models will be equipped with Apple's next-generation M4 chip</a>, rather than the M3 chip that debuted in the MacBook Pro and iMac six months ago. Gurman believes the M4 chip will have an upgraded Neural Engine that is able to process artificial intelligence (AI) tasks faster.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">new Apple Pencil is rumored to feature haptic feedback</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Will the New iPad Pro Really Have the M4 Chip?</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/will-the-new-ipad-pro-really-have-m4/">Will the next iPad Pro models be equipped with the M4 chip</a> instead of the M3 chip, or will this rumor end up being as wrong as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/">flat-edged Apple Watch Series 7</a> from a few years ago?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949125" /><br/>
While it would be unprecedented for an M-series chip to debut in an iPad before a Mac, there is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/will-the-new-ipad-pro-really-have-m4/">some evidence to suggest that the rumor might be true</a>, so check out our story for more details about this possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Beats Solo Buds Launching in June for Just &#36;79.99</h2><br/>
Apple unveiled two new Beats headphone models this week, including the on-ear <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-4-launch/">Beats Solo 4</a> and the compact <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">Beats Solo Buds</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948605" /><br/>
Launching in June, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">Beats Solo Buds are particularly interesting</a> given their competitive &#36;79.99 price point. Key features include ear tips with four size options, up to 18 hours of battery life, a USB-C carrying case, and Find My support on iOS and Android. However, the Solo Buds lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery.<br/>
<br/>
In other Beats news, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/">LeBron James</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/unreleased-beats-pill-daniel-ricciardo/">Daniel Ricciardo</a> have been seen in public carrying an unreleased speaker very clearly descended from the discontinued Beats Pill family, so it looks like the popular portable speaker may be making a comeback in the not too distant future.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 Rumored to Add New Features to These 16 Apps on Your iPhone</h2><br/>
Apple's annual developers conference WWDC is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">now under six weeks away</a>, and that means the iOS 18 beta is just around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Apple-Music-Messages-and-Notes-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948782" /><br/>
iOS 18 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-18-rumor-recap-for-apps/">rumored to include major upgrades to many built-in iPhone apps</a>, including Apple Music, Messages, Calculator, Notes, Safari, and others. We recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-18-rumor-recap-for-apps/">recapped new features that are expected on a per-app basis</a>, so check out the list for a complete overview.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Confirms iPadOS Will Get Same EU App Changes as iOS This Fall</h2><br/>
All of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">app-related changes</a> recently introduced on iPhones in the EU <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/ipados-eu-app-changes-fall/">will also be available on iPads in the EU starting later this fall</a>, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPad-Air-5.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938463" /><br/>
This news comes after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/eu-says-ipados-digital-gatekeeper-dma/">EU ruled that the iPad is a "gatekeeper" platform</a>. Apple has six months to comply with the Digital Markets Act on the iPad, so alternative app marketplaces, support for web browser engines other than WebKit, and more will likely be available by iPadOS 18.1.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is set to hold its first event of the year next Tuesday, and the focus will be on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models are set to be updated, and Apple also plans to refresh some of its &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; accessories. The video-based event will last <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/05/apple-event-about-35-minutes-report/">for about 35 minutes</a>.<br/>

This guide features details on everything that we're expecting to see at the "Let Loose" event that will take place on May 7.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ipad_pro">iPad Pro</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be the star of Apple's event, featuring the first larger form factor OLED displays. OLED display technology will bring deeper blacks, better contrast, more vibrant colors, and better power efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/ipad-pro-best-oled-panels/">said to be using</a> the "best OLED panels on the market" with higher brightness, extended battery life, 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, and a long lifetime for the OLED technology. OLED displays have pixels that can be controlled individually, so high dynamic range content looks more realistic and true-to-life.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPad-Pro-2024-Will-Be-a-Huge-Upgrade-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936070" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be available in 11.1-inch and 12.9-inch sizes, and both models will be thinner with slimmed down bezels. The 11.1-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is expected to be 5.1mm thick, down from 5.9mm, while the 12.9-inch model will be 5mm thick, down from 6.4mm. The tablets will be roughly the same size as the current models, with small changes to the length and width.<br/>
<br/>
It's not entirely clear which M-series chip the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will use, and there is a possibility that these will be the first devices equipped with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/will-the-new-ipad-pro-really-have-m4/">AI-focused next-generation M4 chip</a>. If that doesn't happen, Apple will use the M3 that's in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. Either way, it'll mark a massive improvement.<br/>
<br/>
Along with slimmed down bezels, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s front-facing camera is expected to be relocated to the side of the device rather than the top, so the camera will be upright when the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is in a landscape orientation. That makes more sense for video calls and filming done when the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is used with a keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">possible MagSafe charging support</a> and up to 4TB of storage, and we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/how-much-oled-ipad-pro-models-cost/">could also see prices go up</a>. Multiple sources have said that the OLED technology will make the 2024 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models more expensive, but just how much more expensive remains to be seen. Rumors have ranged from &#36;160 more to &#36;700 more.<br/>
<br/>
For more on the rumors that we've heard so far about the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, we have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">dedicated 2024 iPad Pro guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ipad_air">iPad Air</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will get a refresh alongside the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and for the first time, Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/">splitting the Air lineup</a> and introducing two models. The first &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be a direct successor to the current version, measuring in at 10.9 inches. The second model will come in at 12.9 inches, similar to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Offering the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; in two screen sizes will allow customers who want a large screen at a more affordable price than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; to have that option. The 10.9 and 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models will not have the same OLED screen technology Apple is bringing to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, instead using LCD, and that will keep costs lower.<br/>
<br/>
We are not expecting design changes to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, except for the new, larger size. Both models will look like the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; 4, featuring an edge-to-edge display with slim bezels and an aluminum chassis with flat, rounded edges. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be thicker than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it will have thicker bezels.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/">Leaked iPad Air images</a> point to a rear camera with a protruding pill-shaped camera bump that's similar to the design we're expecting to see with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>. The front camera could be repositioned so that it will be at the top of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; when it's in landscape mode, allowing it to be in the right orientation for video calls when it's used with a keyboard. The current version has the camera at the top when it is in portrait mode.<br/>
<br/>
While we won't see notable design updates, Apple may introduce new color options. The existing model comes in a range of pastel shades, so Apple could tweak the color selection.<br/>
<br/>
We have more on what's expected for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-ipad-air/">in our iPad Air guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_pencil">Apple Pencil</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be accompanied by an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil-3/">updated version of the Apple Pencil</a>, which Apple might call the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> 3. It isn't yet clear if there will be design changes, but it is expected to be the first &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that supports haptic feedback.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/black-and-white-apple-pencil-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2664" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-744328" /><br/>
How that haptic feedback will be used remains to be seen, but code in iOS 17.5 suggested there will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">a "squeeze" gesture</a> that could do things like activate different tools and settings in apps.<br/>
<br/>
There were rumors of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">interchangeable magnetic tips</a> at one point, but we don't know if that's actually a feature that's coming or an inaccurate rumor. Deeper integration with the Vision Pro is a possibility, and it could perhaps work with drawing apps that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>. There's also a chance that we could see the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; come in both black and white rather than just white.<br/>
<br/>
There is a reference to an "&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro" on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-pencil-pro/">Apple's homepage in Japan</a>, and as it is related to the event, it suggests that Apple might be planning to give the new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; a Pro moniker.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's homepage further hints at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-homepage-erasable-logo/">some kind of erase feature</a>, with the logo on the site able to be erased to reveal a new logo.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="magic_keyboard">Magic Keyboard</h2><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/magic-keyboard-apple-pencil-rumors/">overhaul the Magic Keyboard</a>, introducing a sturdier frame <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">made from aluminum</a> rather than the polyurethane material used for the current version. While the frame and area around the keyboard will be made from aluminum, the exterior shell will still be made from silicone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/magic-keyboard-yellow-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-844768" /><br/>
With the aluminum build, an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Magic Keyboard combo will more closely resemble a MacBook, both in terms of looks and functionality. There will be a larger trackpad that is similar to the trackpad on a MacBook, so the keyboard will offer a MacBook-like typing and navigating experience.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is using more premium materials for the new Magic Keyboard, so it could be more expensive. The current model is priced starting at &#36;299 for the 11-inch version. The new Magic Keyboard is likely to work with both the upcoming &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models as they are similar in size (11.1 and 12.9 inches for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and 10.9 and 12.9 inches for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;).<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_accessories">Other Accessories</h2><br/>
Apple refreshes its selection of Apple Watch bands, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> cases, and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; cases regularly, introducing new color options. We could see new summer colors for many accessories, and Apple will need to update its &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; cases to accommodate the new designs. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="vision_pro_expansion">Vision Pro Expansion</h2><br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/">will expand the Vision Pro headset</a> to additional countries before WWDC, and we're getting short on time. We could see Apple bring the Vision Pro to countries like the UK, Canada, China, and more as part of the May 7 event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
<h2 id="how_to_watch">How to Watch</h2><br/>
The "Let Loose" event is set to take place on Tuesday, May 7 at 7:00 a.m. Pacific Time or 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Apple will <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">live stream the event</a> on its website <a href="https://youtu.be/2O7X1Lkphuo">and on YouTube</a>, plus there is an option to watch it on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. The event will last for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/05/apple-event-about-35-minutes-report/">approximately 35 minutes</a>. <br/>

<br/>
This week also saw numerous discounts across the AirPods lineup, including the AirPods 2 for &#36;89.00 and AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.99. The Pro model did briefly hit &#36;179.99 earlier in the week, but that all-time low price has since expired.<br/>
