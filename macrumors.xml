Wi-Fi 7 support would enable the devices to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 is expected to offer peak theoretical data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E.<br/>
<br/>
Wi-Fi 7 support for iPhone 16 Pro models was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">previously rumored by supply chain analyst Jeff Pu</a>. The devices should be released in September.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 Pro models gained support for Wi-Fi 6E, while all iPhone 11 through iPhone 14 models support standard Wi-Fi 6.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/30/iphone-16-pro-wi-fi-7-rumor/">iPhone 16 Pro Models &#039;Widely Expected&#039; to Support Wi-Fi 7</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-models-widely-expected-to-support-wi-fi-7.2432527/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Vision Pro headset can now be controlled using only thoughts, thanks to integration with neurotechnology startup <a href="https://synchron.com">Synchron</a>'s brain-computer interface (BCI).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-vision-pro-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-944159" /><br/>
The company today <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240730923591/en/Synchron-Announces-First-Use-of-Apple-Vision-Pro-with-a-Brain-Computer-Interface/">announced</a> that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> has been successfully used by a patient through direct brain control facilitated by Synchron's brain-computer interface technology. Mark, a 64-year-old man suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), demonstrated the integration.<br/>
<br/>
With this technology, Mark controlled the cursor on the Vision Pro to play Solitaire, watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and send text messages without using his hands, which he can no longer move due to his condition. The Vision Pro's reliance on hand gestures would otherwise pose a barrier for users like Mark who have lost upper limb functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Mark has been practicing different skills and functions with his BCI twice a week since his implantation in August 2023. He noted that using the BCI to control the Vision Pro is similar to using it for his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and computer. Apple's suite of accessibility features across its platforms has been recognized for its excellence, which is why Synchron initially focused on integrating its BCI with Apple devices. <br/>
<br/>
Synchron's brain-computer interface allows individuals with severe physical limitations to control digital devices with their thoughts. The BCI is implanted in the blood vessel on the surface of the motor cortex via a minimally invasive endovascular procedure. The device detects motor intent from the brain and wirelessly transmits these signals to external devices, enabling hands-free control. Tom Oxley, CEO and Founder of Synchron, said:<blockquote>BCI is a platform to re-connect people with injury or disease back to the fast-moving consumer technology landscape. Vision Pro is a powerful system, but it relies on the use of hand gestures to exert control over the UI. We are sending control signals directly from the brain to replace the need for hand gestures. We are moving towards a new Bluetooth standard for Human Computer Interactions that do not require touch or speech. This is a critical unmet need for millions of people with paralysis.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Synchron is preparing for larger-scale clinical studies to expand the reach of its BCI technology. It has implanted its BCI in six patients in the United States and four in Australia. The company continues to seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to commercialize its technology.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/30/vision-pro-can-now-be-controlled-with-brain/">Apple Vision Pro Can Now Be Controlled With Brain-Computer Interface</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-can-now-be-controlled-with-brain-computer-interface.2432526/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple used Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) developed by Google instead of Nvidia's widely-used graphics processing units (GPUs) to construct two critical components of Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
The decision is detailed in a <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/papers/apple_intelligence_foundation_language_models.pdf">new research paper</a> published by Apple that highlights its reliance on Google's cloud hardware (via <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/29/apple-says-its-ai-models-were-trained-on-googles-custom-chips-.html">CNBC</a></em>). The paper reveals that Apple utilized 2,048 of Google's TPUv5p chips to build AI models and 8,192 TPUv4 processors for server AI models. The research paper does not mention Nvidia explicitly, but the absence of any reference to Nvidia's hardware in the description of Apple's AI infrastructure is telling and this omission suggests a deliberate choice to favor Google's technology. <br/>
<br/>
The decision is noteworthy given Nvidia's dominance in the AI processor market and since Apple very rarely discloses its hardware choices for development purposes. Nvidia's GPUs are highly sought after for AI applications due to their performance and efficiency. Unlike Nvidia, which sells its chips and systems as standalone products, Google provides access to its TPUs through cloud services. Customers using Google's TPUs have to develop their software within Google's ecosystem, which offers integrated tools and services to streamline the development and deployment of AI models. <br/>
<br/>
In the paper, Apple's engineers explain that the TPUs allowed them to train large, sophisticated AI models efficiently. They describe how Google's TPUs are organized into large clusters, enabling the processing power necessary for training Apple's AI models. Apple has announced plans to invest over &#36;5 billion in AI server enhancements over the next two years, which should bolster its AI capabilities and reduce its dependence on external hardware providers. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to detailing its use of Google's TPUs, the paper addresses ethical considerations in AI development. Apple emphasized its adherence to responsible data practices, claiming that no private user data was used in training its AI models. The company relied on a mix of publicly available, licensed, and open-sourced datasets for training purposes. Apple added that its training data set, which includes publicly available web data and licensed content, was curated to protect user privacy.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nvidia/">Nvidia</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/30/google-chips-used-to-develop-apple-intelligence/">Apple Used Google Tensor Chips to Develop Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-used-google-tensor-chips-to-develop-apple-intelligence.2432521/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Some iPhone SE 4 OLED Panels to Be Supplied by LG Display</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple supplier LG Display is expected to be the secondary vendor for the OLED panels that will feature on next year's fourth-generation iPhone SE models, reports <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4926">The Elec</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
The fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature an iPhone 14-like design with an OLED display, Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, an Action button, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. The device's display is expected to grow in size from 4.7 inches to 6.06 inches and use OLED for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
BOE will be the primary supplier of the OLED panels, with LG Display providing backup, according to today's report. In previous years, Apple has solely tasked China-based BOE to supply LCD-based iPhone SE panels. But BOE has struggled before with yield issues for OLED iPhone panels, so bringing LG Display into the picture as a secondary supplier could be Apple's way of having a security blanket in case of future problems.<br/>
<br/>
The panel prices for the iPhone SE 4 are said to be a lot lower than suppliers charge for the OLED displays used in the iPhone 15, since the panels for the SE will use legacy parts identical to those used in the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, so the suppliers won't need to make new investments in R&D. Display manufacturers are believed to have been bidding to supply the panels since at least last August. Mass production of the device will reportedly begin in October of this year, with the iPhone SE 4 expected to arrive in spring 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/30/iphone-se-4-oled-panels-lg-display/">Some iPhone SE 4 OLED Panels to Be Supplied by LG Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-iphone-se-4-oled-panels-to-be-supplied-by-lg-display.2432518/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple introduced the first version of Apple Intelligence in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 developer betas. While the betas include some useful Apple Intelligence features like Writing Tools, some of the Apple Intelligence additions won't be coming until later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
We've rounded up everything that's not yet been added to the betas, with Apple planning to introduce these features at a later date.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Image Playground</strong> - Both the standalone app and the functionality built into apps like Notes and Messages are missing from the current beta.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Genmoji</strong> - Genmoji is based on Image Playground, and it is unavailable.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Image Wand</strong> - Image Wand, the feature that inserts images into your Notes based on context, is also based on Image Playground so it won't be available until Image Playground is added to the beta.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Priority Notifications</strong> - Priority notifications show up at the top of the notification stack, so you can get to what's most important first. The feature also summarizes your incoming notifications so you can sort through them more quickly.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Mail</strong> - Mail categories that sort your incoming messages are not yet available.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Photos</strong> - While the Memory Maker feature is active in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, the Clean Up tool that removes unwanted objects from images with a tap is not available.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Siri</strong> - Functionality that includes onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability to take more actions in and across apps is not yet available.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>ChatGPT</strong> - ChatGPT integration with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> has not yet been implemented.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Additional Languages</strong> - Apple Intelligence is available in U.S. English only as of now, but support for additional languages will be coming in the future.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Additional Platforms</strong> - As Apple said in its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">WWDC coverage</a> of Apple Intelligence, the Apple Intelligence feature set will eventually expand to additional platforms.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 are only available to developers right now, and Apple Intelligence is still in the early stages of testing. Apple Intelligence features will be available to everyone later this fall in an update to the initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; releases. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/">All of the Apple Intelligence Features Not Included in the iOS 18.1 Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-of-the-apple-intelligence-features-not-included-in-the-ios-18-1-beta.2432499/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

With the new software, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip is able to run two external displays in clamshell mode, aka when the lid is closed.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919851" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple introduced dual display support in clamshell mode for the M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models when they were released in March 2024, but at the time, the option was not available for the M3 14-inch MacBook Pro released back in October 2023. Apple said at the time that it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-pro-multi-display-support/">planning to release</a> a software update that would add multi-display support to the M3 MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The change is mentioned in Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109035">macOS Sonoma update support document</a> and in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117373">a support document</a> on using dual monitors with the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro now supports one external display at 6K resolution when the lid is open, or two external displays at 5K resolution at up to 60Hz when the lid is closed.<br/>
<br/>
Higher-end MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips were already able to support multiple displays, so today's change only applies to the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro model.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the display update, &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.6 addresses a number of security vulnerabilities as outlined in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214119">Apple's security support document</a>. None of the vulnerabilities are known to have been actively exploited in the wild, but it is still a good idea to update as soon as possible.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/macos-sonoma-14-6-dual-display-support/">macOS Sonoma 14.6 Adds Dual External Display Support to M3 14-Inch MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sonoma-14-6-adds-dual-external-display-support-to-m3-14-inch-macbook-pro.2432496/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 for developers, introducing the first Apple Intelligence features. Apple Intelligence was previewed in June, and is Apple's version of artificial intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960229" /><br/>
Not all of the Apple Intelligence features are available as of yet, but we've rounded up a list of what's active in the beta. Note that iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 are limited to developers only at this time, with the software set to come out to all users in a beta capacity this fall.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence is in the early stages of refinement, and Apple is working out bugs and polishing the new features before launch. Apple Intelligence will improve over time, and the features that are missing in the developer beta will roll out later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Writing Tools</h2><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-writing-tools.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960221" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Proofread text for spelling and grammar errors, including word choice and sentence structure. You can accept all suggestions with a tap or go through them one by one with explanations. </li><br/>
 	<li>Rewrite for cleaning up what you've written and shifting the tone without impacting your content. Options include Friendly, Professional, and Concise.</li><br/>
 	<li>Options for selecting text and summarizing it. You can choose to create a paragraph, pull out key points, make a list, or create a table. Summaries are available in Mail, Messages, and more.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You can select any text on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac and use Apple Intelligence to access Writing Tools for summaries and other features.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Siri</h2><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960222" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>New glow around the edges of the display when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is activated, applicable to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>. On Mac, the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; window can be placed anywhere. The glow animates responsively to the sound of your voice so you can tell when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is listening without interrupting other things you're doing.</li><br/>
 	<li>A double tap at the bottom of the display brings up the Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interface so you can type requests instead of speaking them. If this isn't working, you may need to restart. On Mac, you need to press the Command key twice to bring up Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; includes suggested requests so you can get your questions answered faster.</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can maintain context between requests so you can ask a question and then reference it in a second reply. If you ask about the temperature in Orlando, for example, and then follow up with "what's the humidity?" &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will know you mean in Orlando.</li><br/>
 	<li>If you stumble over your words when speaking to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, or shift what you're saying mid-sentence, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can follow along.</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has Apple's product knowledge and support base for answering questions about your device's features and settings, and can even find settings when you don't know the exact name.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Mail</h2><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-smart-replies.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960207" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>There is a summarize button for summarizing any of your incoming emails, plus you will see a brief summary of an email in your inbox list rather than the first few lines of the email.</li><br/>
 	<li>Mail surfaces time sensitive messages first when applicable, putting them at the top of your inbox so you see what's important right away.</li><br/>
 	<li>Smart Reply provides quick-tap responses to emails that you've been sent, with contextual options based on what's in the email.</li><br/>
<li>Multiple notifications from Mail will be summarized on your Lock Screen so you can see what's in an email without opening the app.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Messages</h2><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-messages-smart-reply.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960223" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Messages has Smart Reply options for incoming texts, which analyze the content of messages to offer suggestions of what you might want to say.</li><br/>
<li>Multiple Messages notifications are summarized on your Lock Screen.</li><br/>
<br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Photos</h2><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-memory-maker.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960208" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>You can create a Memory Movie with just a description, such as "My cat in 2024," or "Orlando in the summer." The feature automatically picks relevant photos and chooses songs, but you can tweak through the Memory Mixes feature or choose a mood to guide the direction of the audio. You can also add in specific scenes and images you want to see throughout the memory when you're creating the prompt.</li><br/>
 	<li>Natural language search is available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, so you can just describe what you're looking for, such as "Eric rollerskating while wearing green."</li><br/>
 	<li>Search can also find specific moments in video clips.</li><br/>
<li>Search offers up smart complete suggestions for narrowing down what you might want to find</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Transcription</h2><br/>
In Notes and other apps, you can record audio and get a transcript along with a summary of your transcript, which is useful for recording lectures and other audio.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Focus Modes</h2><br/>
There is a dedicated Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode that only shows you important notifications that need attention while filtering out everything else.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-focus-mode-changes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960224" /><br/>
When customizing an existing Focus mode or creating a new one, there is a new toggle to turn on Intelligent Breakthrough and Silencing. This option allows important notifications to interrupt you, while muting notifications that are not important, which is the same thing that the Reduce Notifications Focus does. You can override the notification settings for specific apps and people, which is how it worked prior to iOS 18.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-focus-reduce-interruptions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960225" /><br/>
<h2>Phone</h2><br/>
Phone call recording <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-call-recording-and-transcribing/">is available in iOS 18.1</a>. When starting a call, you can tap on the little record button in the upper left corner of the display. All participants are notified that the call is being recorded before the recording starts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" alt="" width="5416" height="3047" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" /><br/>
Recorded phone calls are stored in the Notes app, where you can tap in to view a transcript and get a summary generated from that transcript.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Safari</h2><br/>
When reading an article in Reader Mode, there is an option to have Apple Intelligence summarize the article for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-safari-summarize.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960226" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Report</h2><br/>
In the Privacy and Security section of the Settings app you can access an Apple Intelligence Report that lets you export your Apple Intelligence data as part of Apple's promise for transparency around Apple Intelligence. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> is required to access and export Apple Intelligence data.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-report.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960227" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Waitlist</h2><br/>
Developers that upgrade to iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, or &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 will need to go to the Settings app and join the Apple Intelligence waitlist. There is a waitlist mechanic to ensure that behind the scenes downloads go smoothly and that the system isn't overloaded.<br/>
<br/>
While on the waitlist, Apple devices download necessary files for on-device processing, and so far, the time from Apple Intelligence waitlist signups to activation has been quick. The waitlist is on a per-account basis, so you only need to sign up for it on one device to have access on multiple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Compatibility</h2><br/>
The iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 betas are only available to registered developers with an eligible device. Devices that cannot run Apple Intelligence will not see the update.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max</li><br/>
 	<li>All Apple silicon iPads</li><br/>
 	<li>All Apple silicon Macs</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Availability</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence is only available in U.S. English at this time, and it is not available to developers in the European Union or China. Device region and language need to be set to the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Launch Date</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence will not be in the initial launch version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> that comes out in September alongside new iPhones. It will instead be introduced in a separate iOS 18.1 update that is likely to come out a few weeks after &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; debuts.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">Here Are All of the Apple Intelligence Features in the iOS 18.1 Developer Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-of-the-apple-intelligence-features-in-the-ios-18-1-developer-beta.2432493/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6, the sixth point updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> operating system updates that came out last year. The iOS and iPadOS 17.6 updates come two months after the debut of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-releases-ios-17-5/">iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5</a>.<br/>

iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 can be downloaded on eligible iPhones and iPads over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update. Apple has also released iOS 15.8.3 and iOS 16.7.9 security updates for devices not able to run &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There are no notable features in the iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 updates, with Apple adding unspecified bug fixes and security updates. Nothing new was discovered during the beta testing process.<br/>
<blockquote>This update provides important bug fixes and security updates and is recommended for all users.</blockquote><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.3, the third major update to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; operating system that launched alongside the Vision Pro in February. &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.3 comes a little over a month after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-releases-visionos-1-2/">the launch of visionOS 1.2</a>.<br/>
<br/>

‌&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj;‌ updates can be installed by going to the Settings app on the Vision Pro, selecting the General section, and choosing Software Update. The Vision Pro headset will need to be removed to install new software, with a progress bar available on the front EyeSight display.<br/>
<br/>
There are no new features in the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.3 update, but it does bring small bug fixes and security improvements. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released tvOS 17.6, the sixth update to the tvOS 17 operating system that came out last September. tvOS 17.6 comes over two months after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-releases-tvos-17-5/">Apple released tvOS 17.5</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" /><br/>
tvOS 17.6 can be downloaded using the Settings app on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>‌. Go to System > Software Update to get the new software. ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ owners who have automatic software updates activated will be upgraded to tvOS 17.6 automatically over time. <br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale, and tvOS 17.6 is no exception. There were no new features found during the beta testing process. <br/>
<br/>
Apple shares release notes for tvOS <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106336">in its tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each new version of tvOS comes out.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also released a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 17.6 software update for the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-tvos-17-6/">Apple Releases tvOS 17.6 With Bug Fixes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-tvos-17-6-with-bug-fixes.2432487/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 18.1 beta that Apple provided to developers today introduces Apple Intelligence, and it includes the feature that allows users to record and transcribe phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" alt="" width="5416" height="3047" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" /><br/>
With the update, you can tap on the record button in the top left corner after placing a call. Everyone on the call is notified that the call is being recorded through an audible message. There is no confirmation dialogue, so if a person wanted to not be recorded, they would need to hang up.<br/>
<br/>
Once the call is in progress, the audio is recorded and saved to the Notes app. Recorded phone calls can be opened from Notes, and you can re-listen to the call, view a full transcript, and get a summary from the transcript without having to re-listen to the entire thing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960200" /><br/>
Summaries are active across the operating system in iOS 18.1, and you can essentially select any text on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to get a summary of it.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence is limited to the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 developer betas at this time, and the software will be available to the public later this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-call-recording-and-transcribing/">iOS 18.1 Beta Includes Call Recording and Transcribing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-1-beta-includes-call-recording-and-transcribing.2432481/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is today providing developers with the first betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1, with the new software introducing an early version of the Apple Intelligence features. These new betas will be in testing alongside the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15 betas. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
Developers can choose whether to opt into the new betas with Apple Intelligence, or stay on the standard &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15 beta track. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> or Mac with an Apple silicon chip is required to use Apple Intelligence, and only eligible devices will see the updates. <br/>
<br/>
After updating, turning on Apple Intelligence can be done in the Settings app. There is an Apple Intelligence Waitlist that developers must opt into, but access should be granted within a few hours.<br/>
<br/>
Several Apple Intelligence features are available as of today, including Writing Tools, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>'s revamped design, the option to move between voice commands and typing to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, summaries for transcripts and other content, the new Mail categories and smart replies, smart replies in Messages, and more. <br/>
<br/>
With Writing Tools, you can rewrite, spellcheck, grammar check, and summarize text in Messages, Notes, Mail, Pages, and other apps where you write. Summaries also work for transcripts in the Notes app.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s updated design shows a glow around the edges of the screen when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is activated, and tapping at the bottom of the display allows you to type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; rather than use voice commands. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has all of Apple's product knowledge and Apple's support database, so you can ask for help, plus the personal assistant can maintain context between requests and better follow along if you stumble over your words or change your mind when speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Mail supports summaries of messages along with Smart Reply options, with Smart Reply also available for the Messages app. The Reduce Interruptions Focus mode is available to filter out unimportant notifications while surfacing notifications you need immediately, such as a ride arriving. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> supports Memories, so you can create a slideshow with natural language requests, and there's natural language for search. Search now encompasses videos so you can get right to the video segment you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Features that are not available today include Image Playground, Genmoji, ChatGPT integration, the option to erase objects in &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, Priority Notifications, and other &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities like the ability to do more in apps and on-screen awareness. New capabilities will be rolled out over time, with Apple making regular updates. <br/>
<br/>
As of right now, the Apple Intelligence features are limited to the developer beta, and it is not clear if there will be a public beta for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1. Apple plans to release Apple Intelligence in a beta capacity later this fall, and as these features are in a separate beta from the launch versions of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15, Apple Intelligence will not be available right away when the new software updates first come out in September. <br/>
<br/>
When Apple Intelligence does officially launch this fall, it will still be in beta. Developers who plan to install the new updates today should be aware that Apple Intelligence is still in the early stages of development.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence Now Available in New iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia Developer Betas</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-now-available-in-new-ios-18-1-ipados-18-1-and-macos-sequoia-developer-betas.2432474/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The second public beta comes two weeks after Apple released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-releases-ios-18-public-beta-1/">the first public beta</a>. <br/>
<br/>

Public beta testers who have <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">signed up for Apple's beta testing program</a> can download the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; updates by opening up the Settings app, going to General, tapping into the Software Update section and selecting the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; Public Beta option.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, which are AI features deeply integrated into the operating system. Not all functionality is available at this time, but it brings Writing Tools for rewriting, polishing, proofreading, and summarizing text across apps, and you can generate custom images with Image Playground. There are custom emoji available through the Genmoji feature, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is getting entirely overhauled. Note that Apple Intelligence isn't yet live in the betas. <br/>

Along with the AI features (which will be limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and M-series iPads), &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; brings a redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> with the option to rearrange app icons and widgets with open spaces, plus there's a tint option and new darker colors for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a>.<br/>

Control Center has been revamped and you can pick and choose what you want to have front and center from the new Controls Gallery. There are multiple pages so you can group related controls, and you can customize sizes. As part of this update, the Flashlight and Camera icons on the Lock Screen can be swapped out, and you can also choose Control Center options for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Action Button.<br/>

The Messages app supports scheduling texts, you can use any emoji for the Tapback feature, and you can send messages via satellite. There are text effects you can use for any word, phrase, or emoji, plus formatting like bold and italic is an option. For texts with Android users, Apple now supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>, which basically means you won't run into issues with sending images and files, plus you can see typing indicators and read receipts and send texts over Wi-Fi.<br/>

Safari is able to summarize webpages and show you important info at a glance, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app has been overhauled to focus more on surfacing your best photos.

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> has announced that the second season of its sci-fi show "Silo" will premiere on Friday, November 15, 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/silo-tv-show-apple-tv-plus.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-901731" /><br/>
"Silo" follows the last ten thousand people on Earth who live in a massive underground bunker to escape the toxic environment above. The inhabitants are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette, an engineer who uncovers deeper mysteries while investigating a loved one's murder. The second season will continue to explore the storylines from the first season, with new twists and revelations. <br/>
<br/>
The first season of "Silo" premiered on May 5, 2023, and production for the second season was delayed due to the 2023 Hollywood strikes. Based on the Wool trilogy by Hugh Howey, the new season will feature ten episodes, releasing weekly until January 17, 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The announcement was made at Comic-Con 2024 (via <em><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/silo-season-2-release-date-steve-zahn-1236024269/">Deadline</a></em>), where it was also revealed that Steve Zahn will join the cast. Zahn made a surprise appearance at the fan panel alongside creator and showrunner Graham Yost, author and executive producer Hugh Howey, executive producer Rebecca Ferguson, and star Common. In addition to Zahn, the returning cast includes Tim Robbins, Harriet Walter, Chinaza Uche, Avi Nash, Alexandria Riley, Shane McCrae, Remmie Milner, Clare Perkins, Billy Postlethwaite, Rick Gomez, Caitlin Zoz, Tanya Moodie, and Iain Glen.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Luxury French fashion house Balenciaga and premium German luggage brand Rimowa have launched apps for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, expanding the headset's immersive fashion experiences.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/balenciaga-vision-pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-960173" /><br/>
Balenciaga has now introduced the first phase of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balenciaga/id6526492361">its Apple Vision Pro app</a>, designed to provide users with an immersive view of its fashion shows and collections. The app offers exclusive drone views and stereoscopic footage of Balenciaga's Spring/Summer 2025 show, which was held in Shanghai on May 30. Users can also access an interactive lookbook and past collection content, enabling them to explore Balenciaga's fashion in a virtual environment. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rimowa-explore/id6474133662">Rimowa's app for the Apple Vision Pro</a> offers an immersive and interactive experience that allows users to explore the brand's iconic suitcases in detail. The app provides high-resolution 3D models of Rimowa's products, enabling users to examine the craftsmanship and design from various angles. It also includes features like virtual try-ons, where users can see how different suitcase models look and function in a virtual space. Additionally, the app offers a virtual showroom experience, allowing users to customize their luggage with different colors and accessories, and view the changes in real time. <br/>
<br/>
Balenciaga and Rimowa's apps are part of a broader trend among luxury brands exploring the potential of the Vision Pro. Gucci, also a Kering-owned label like Balenciaga, released its own Vision Pro app in April, allowing users to access an immersive mini-documentary on creative director Sabato De Sarno and the creation of Gucci's Spring/Summer 2024 collection. Other retailers, including Mytheresa, J.Crew, and E.l.f. Cosmetics, have developed Vision Pro apps focused more on shopping than on brand storytelling.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/balenciaga-and-rimowa-launch-apps-for-vision-pro/">Balenciaga and Rimowa Launch Apps for Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/balenciaga-and-rimowa-launch-apps-for-apple-vision-pro.2432450/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Fixes iCloud Private Relay After Extended Outage</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has resolved the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/icloud-private-relay-experiencing-outage/">iCloud Private Relay service outage</a>, restoring full functionality for users around the world after several days of disruption.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/icloud-private-relay-outage.jpg" alt="" width="1339" height="753" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-960053" /><br/>
The recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Private Relay outage began at 02:34 AM Eastern Time on Thursday and lasted until 10:59 PM Eastern Time on Saturday. The issue disrupted web browsing for some users for over 48 hours, which is an unusually long period for an Apple service outage. The problem was confirmed by Apple through its <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/">System Status webpage</a>, where it noted that the service might have been slow or unavailable. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay is a feature available to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ subscribers, designed to enhance privacy by encrypting browsing data and routing it through two separate relay servers. One of these servers is operated by Apple, while the other is managed by a third party. This setup ensures that neither Apple, internet service providers, nor the websites visited can access users' true browsing information. The service's dual-relay mechanism helps maintain a high level of privacy by separating the user's IP address from their DNS queries, which further obscures the user's online activity.<br/>
<br/>
Users who had disabled &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay to mitigate browsing issues can now go ahead and re-enable the feature to continue utilizing its privacy benefits.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-fixes-icloud-private-relay/">Apple Fixes iCloud Private Relay After Extended Outage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-fixes-icloud-private-relay-after-extended-outage.2432447/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
