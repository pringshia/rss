		<description><![CDATA[Macs equipped with the standard M3 chip still support only one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz, according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/">Apple's tech specs</a>. So far, the chip is available in the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro and the 24-inch iMac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/Pro-Display-XDR-Red.jpg" alt="" width="2590" height="1456" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-743452" /><br/>
This limitation has existed since the first Apple silicon Macs with the M1 chip were released in 2020, but users can connect multiple external displays to M1, M2, and M3 Macs with DisplayLink adapters as an unofficial workaround. One exception is the Mac mini, which will likely be updated with the M3 chip next year and should retain support for up to two external displays, given that it lacks a built-in display.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models support up to two external displays with the M3 Pro chip, and up to four with the M3 Max chip.<br/>
<br/>
M3 chip display support:<blockquote>One external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz</blockquote>M3 Pro chip display support:<blockquote>Up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt, or one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI<br/>
<br/>
One external display supported at 8K resolution at 60Hz or one external display at 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
M3 Max chip display support:<blockquote>Up to four external displays: Up to three external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI<br/>
<br/>
Up to three external displays: Up to two external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or one external display with 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI</blockquote>The new MacBook Pro models are now available to order, and most configurations will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7. M3 Max configurations will be available later in November.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/m3-chip-still-supports-one-external-display/">Macs With M3 Chip Still Officially Support Only a Single External Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macs-with-m3-chip-still-officially-support-only-a-single-external-display.2409623/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple routinely stops signing older iOS releases over time in order to prevent users from downgrading to previous software versions.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 is currently the newest version available to the public, while iOS 17.2 is in beta testing and is expected to be released in December.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">many new features and changes</a>, including the promised Journal app, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also stopped signing iOS 15.7.9, iOS 16.7, and iOS 16.7.1.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-0-3/">Downgrading an iPhone to iOS 17.0.3 is No Longer Possible</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/downgrading-an-iphone-to-ios-17-0-3-is-no-longer-possible.2409610/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> now features the M3 chip, replacing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> model that Apple introduced in April 2021, so how different are the two successive generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M1-versus-M3-iMac-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920212" /><br/>
The 2021 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; was the first of its kind to feature an Apple silicon chip, replacing previous Intel-based models with 21.5- and 27-inch displays. It offered an all-new ultra-thin design, a 24-inch Retina display, a six-speaker system with force-cancelling woofers, and an array of seven two-tone color options. The 2021 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; has now been discontinued by Apple and prices at third-party resellers are falling. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to upgrade to a 2021 or 2023 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>

The two Apple silicon &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; models share the overwhelming majority of their features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the first-generation to save money?

<br/>
Overall, the 2023 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is a very minor upgrade over the 2021 model, with the M3 chip being the most significant change. As a result, it is difficult to recommend upgrading from an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; model unless you specifically need better performance, hardware-accelerated graphics, or a larger quantity of memory. The new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is up to 2x faster than the prior generation with the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip, according to Apple, meaning that it should deliver a considerable performance improvement for those who need it.<br/>
<br/>
Most users of the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; will not be able to justify upgrading to the M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, but customers coming from an older Intel-based machine or those who do not have one at all could still have good reason to prefer the latest model. For those upgrading from an Intel-based ‌&zwnj;iMac&zwnj;‌, Apple says that the new ‌&zwnj;iMac&zwnj;‌ is up to 2.5x faster than previous 27-inch models and 4.5x faster than previous 21.5-inch models.<br/>
<br/>
The 2023 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is otherwise very similar to the 2021 model, so some customers who have very basic needs and are interested in buying an &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; may prefer to look for a discounted 2021 model. The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;1,299, so if you are not interested in its new features and can find the original model for substantially less, it may be worth getting that instead. Even so, it should be remembered that this is a much older model; the M3 model will be more future-proof and capable in the long term.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-vs-m3-imac/">M1 vs. M3 iMac Buyer&#039;s Guide: 15+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-vs-m3-imac-buyers-guide-15-differences-compared.2409603/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first benchmark results for Apple's M3 Max chip <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/17lr5ck/m3_max_first_geekbench_6_results/">surfaced</a> in the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=mac15%2C9">Geekbench 6 database</a> today, providing a look at CPU performance. Based on the "Mac15,9" model identifier shown, the results <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1719775450963095885">appear to be</a> for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Max-Chip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920348" /><br/>
The highest multi-core score for the M3 Max with a 16-core CPU is currently 21,084 as of writing. If this early result is accurate, this means the M3 Max is around as fast as the M2 Ultra chip, which has an average multi-core score of 21,182 in the Mac Pro and 21,316 in the Mac Studio, according to a <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks">chart on the Geekbench website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 Max in the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is around 45% faster than the M2 Max chip in the previous-generation 16-inch MacBook Pro, according to the Geekbench website. This is within the ballpark of Apple's claim that the M3 Max is up to 50% faster than the M2 Max, especially given variance in early Geekbench results.<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench 6 multi-core scores for CPU performance:<ul><li>M2 Ultra: 21,182 (Mac Pro, averaged)</li><br/>
<li><strong>M3 Max: 21,084 (16-inch MacBook Pro, highest score listed so far)</strong></li><br/>
<li>M2 Max: 14,495 (16-inch MacBook Pro, averaged)</li><br/>
<li>M1 Max: 12,185 (16-inch MacBook Pro, averaged)</li><br/>
<li>M3: 11,836 (14-inch MacBook Pro, highest score listed so far)</li></ul>Manufactured with TSMC's 3nm process, the M3 Max has up to a 16-core CPU with 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores. It also has up to a 40-core GPU and can be configured with up to 128GB of unified memory.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Max-Specs.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920350" /><br/>
The new 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S. when configured with the M3 Max chip, while the Mac Studio with the M2 Ultra chip starts at &#36;3,999, so you can effectively get the same performance for &#36;500 less with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, and do not need to supply your own display, keyboard, and mouse.<br/>
<br/>
The first Geekbench 6 results for the standard M3 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">surfaced earlier today</a>, revealing that it is up to 20% faster than the standard M2 chip. Benchmarks provide a useful reference point, but real-world performance can vary.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are now available to order, and most configurations will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7. M3 Max configurations will be available later in November.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-max-chip-benchmark-results/">M3 Max Chip Around as Fast as M2 Ultra in Early Benchmark Results</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-max-chip-around-as-fast-as-m2-ultra-in-early-benchmark-results.2409580/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 182 includes fixes and updates for CSS, Forms, HTML, JavaScript, Loading, Media, Rendering, Scrolling, Storage, SVG, Text, Web API, Web Assembly, Web Inspector, and WebRTC.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>

Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the results on a conference call with analysts a half hour later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Keep reading for some key things to know about the quarter, including a recap of new products announced, revenue expectations, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Products During Quarter</h2><br/>
The quarter ran from ran from July 2 through September 30, according to Apple's fiscal calendar, and included the following product launches:<ul><li>iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max</li><br/>
<li>Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2</li><br/>
<li>AirPods Pro with USB-C charging case and EarPods with USB-C connector</li></ul><h2>Revenue Expectations</h2><br/>
Apple has not provided formal revenue guidance since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Wall Street expects the company to report revenue of &#36;89.28 billion in the fourth quarter, according <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/01/apple-q4-2023-earnings-preview-fourth-consecutive-sales-decline-expected.html">to <em>CNBC</em></a>. This would be around a 1% decline compared to the &#36;90.15 billion revenue the company reported in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Maestri provided the following commentary on Apple's earnings call last quarter:<blockquote>We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.</blockquote><h2>Conference Call</h2><br/>
Cook and Maestri will hold a conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Thursday to discuss the company's fourth quarter earnings results. The call should last around one hour and will include a Q&A segment with analysts.<br/>

		<title>Have a 13-Inch MacBook Pro? Here&#039;s Why You Should Upgrade to the New M3 14-Inch Model</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week discontinued the 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> MacBook Pro, replacing it with a 14-inch model that's equipped with a next-generation M3 chip. The 14-inch model is more expensive, but it comes with a number of benefits that make it worth the upgrade for anyone with a 13-inch machine. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3mBLetnQpk" title="Apple M3 14-Inch MacBook Pro vs M2 13-Inch MacBook Pro: Worth the Upgrade?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro has a larger display than the 13-inch model for more screen real estate, and it features much more modern-looking thin bezels. There's also a notch that houses the front-facing camera, a necessity for those slimmed down bezels. It is a mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR display, which is an upgrade over the LCD of the prior-generation 13-inch model. <br/>
<br/>
Along with support for 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, the 14-inch MacBook Pro's display is brighter and has better color and HDR support. SDR brightness is 600 nits, while XDR brightness is 1000 nits sustained and 1600 nits peak.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of performance, you're going to see a boost in CPU and GPU speeds, but it will be most noticeable if you're coming from an Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip or an even earlier Intel chip. The M3 has an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU much like the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, but the GPU supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing so gameplay will be improved.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life has seen a boost, so the 14-inch MacBook Pro now lasts for up to 22 hours, up two hours from the 20 hour battery life of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you were a fan of the Touch Bar, be warned that the 14-inch MacBook Pro does not have one. With the discontinuation of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has officially nixed the Touch Bar. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of size, the 14-inch MacBook Pro is a little wider, a little longer, and just a bit heavier than the 13-inch model. It weighs 3.4 pounds while the 13-inch model weighed 3 pounds. There are more ports with the M3 MacBook Pro, so in addition to two Thunderbolt ports, you'll also get an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charging port. <br/>
<br/>
Other improvements include a better 1080p <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> HD camera, a six-speaker sound system, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3. <br/>
<br/>
The only real downside with the 14-inch MacBook Pro is the price. It starts at &#36;1,599, making it &#36;300 more expensive than the &#36;1,299 starting price of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you can afford it, what you get for the extra &#36;300 is worth it, but if that makes it too pricey, you'll need to look at the lower-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. <br/>
<br/>
For those with an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro, it's probably not worth upgrading to the 14-inch model right now despite the benefits, but if you're coming from an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro or an Intel machine, it's going to be a much more notable upgrade that will feel closer to night and day.<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/apple-music-voice-plan-feature-blue-green.jpg" alt="" width="1812" height="1020" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-830419" /><br/>
"Beginning in November, Apple will discontinue the Apple Music Voice plan," said Apple. "We are focused on delivering the best, most robust music experience possible for our customers, with features like immersive Spatial Audio, Apple Music Sing with real-time lyrics, intuitive browse and discovery features, and so much more."<br/>
<br/>
Apple said existing subscribers can continue to use the Voice Plan for the duration of their final billing cycle, but they will lose access after that period. It's unclear why the plan was discontinued, but Apple says other Apple Music plans "already work seamlessly with Siri, and we will continue to optimize this experience."<br/>
<br/>
Apple added that existing subscribers will receive a notification prior to the end of their final billing cycle with more information.<br/>
<br/>
Priced at &#36;4.99 per month in the U.S., the Voice Plan was designed to let users access Apple Music exclusively through Siri. The plan launched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/14/ios-15-2-apple-music-voice-plan-video/">as part of iOS 15.2</a> in December 2021 in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, and the U.K.<br/>
<br/>
The primary way to subscribe to the Voice Plan was by asking Siri, and music playback was controlled via Siri too. While the plan provided access to the entire Apple Music catalog with over 100 million songs, it lacked some features available on more expensive plans, such as downloading, spatial audio, and Family Sharing.<br/>

<br/>

The Macs will ship with a custom version of &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.1 with a build number of 23B2073, but new users will need to download and install a new version with a build number of 23B2077.<br/>
<br/>
Day one updates are not unusual for new devices as Apple often has to begin manufacturing with an older version of the software. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-1/">first released macOS Sonoma 14.1</a> on Wednesday, October 25, and the current version has a build number of 23B74.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Introductory production on the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 will start in India in the second half of 2025, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/iphone印度生產狀況更新-iphone-17-npi可能將在印度啟動-update-on-iphone-production-in-india-iphone-17-npi-likely-4088fb656708">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo says that new product introduction (NPI) for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 will happen in India, marking the first time that Apple begins development of a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; outside of China.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/apple-india.jpg" alt="" width="2304" height="1296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756076" /><br/>
Apple will opt to assemble the standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 in India because it has a "lower difficulty" design that will minimize risk. Apple has been manufacturing older iPhones and other devices in India since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/02/apple-iphone-manufacturing-india-official/">for several years now</a> in an effort to move more of its manufacturing out of China. Apple has slowly started giving factories in India <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/26/apple-manufacturing-iphone-14-india/">more responsibility</a>, and began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> production in the country just a few weeks after the device launched in September 2022. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> production started even earlier, with factories in the country assembling the base &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/new-iphone-starts-production-outside-china/">prior to launch</a>, but assembly still started in China first.<br/>
<br/>
Apple works with Foxconn, Pegatron, and Tata (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tata-make-iphones-india-after-buying-wistron-business-2023-10-27/">new owner of Wistron</a>) to manufacture iPhones in India, with Foxconn handling 75 to 80 percent of the device assembly. Foxconn has invested more than &#36;500 million in India to ramp up its manufacturing capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
As of now, Kuo believes that 12 to 14 percent of global &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; shipments are made in India, with that proportion to increase to 20 to 25 percent by 2024. In addition to allowing Apple to move manufacturing away from China, increasing production in India provides Apple with an opportunity to strengthen its relationship with the Indian government. India is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/08/apple-india-focus-international-sales/">key market for Apple</a> due to growing demand for Apple products in the country.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in 2023 opened its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/apple-stores-india-wallpapers/">first retail stores in Mumbai</a>, but online sales have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/23/apple-online-store-india-launch/">available in India</a> since 2020.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/iphone-17-assembly-india/">iPhone 17 to Be Assembled in India as Apple Aims to Further Diversify Supply Chain</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-to-be-assembled-in-india-as-apple-aims-to-further-diversify-supply-chain.2409529/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Priced at &#36;79, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is compatible with all iPads that feature a USB-C port, and it serves as an alternative to the more expensive first and second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models.<br/>

The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; features a matte finish and a flat magnetic side to allow it to attach to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> when not in use, plus there is a hidden USB-C port under the sliding cap for charging purposes. Unlike the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2, it is not able to charge magnetically when attached to an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and it is also lacking pressure sensitivity and support for tap gestures. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A legal claim in the United Kingdom over Apple's 2017 "throttling" controversy has been allowed to move forward by the Competition Appeal Tribunal, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/mass-lawsuit-against-apple-over-iphone-batteries-can-go-ahead-london-tribunal-2023-11-01/">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-slow-16x9-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1314" height="740" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920127" /><br/>
Consumer advocate Justin Gutmann <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/16/uk-legal-claim-25-million-users-battery-throttling/">filed the claim back in June 2022,</a> originally seeking a total of £750 million for up to 25 million <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the UK whose devices were affected by the issue, which stemmed from Apple's efforts to prevent devices with degraded batteries from unexpectedly shutting down while in use. The claim has since ballooned to as much at £1.6 billion plus interest.<blockquote>Gutmann's lawyers had argued Apple concealed issues with batteries in certain phone models and "surreptitiously" installed a power management tool which limited performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple, however, said the lawsuit is "baseless" and that it strongly denies batteries in iPhones were defective, apart from in a small number of iPhone 6s models for which it offered free battery replacements.</blockquote>Gutmann's claim covers &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 through &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X models, and while the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled the claim can move forward, it also highlighted "a lack of clarity and specificity" that will need to be resolved before it can actually proceed to trial.<br/>
<br/>
Apple deployed power management features with iOS 10.2.1 in 2017 that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/">throttled performance</a> to prevent devices with degraded batteries from attempting to draw peak power the batteries could no longer provide. Apple says it introduced the features to help extend device lifespan while minimizing disruptive device shutdowns, but the company was criticized by some customers for not disclosing what it was doing amid suggestions it was attempting to hide defective devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/">apologized</a> for not better explaining the changes it made and why it did so, and introduced a low-cost battery replacement program that lasted for several years.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The first benchmark results for the standard M3 chip surfaced <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=mac15%2C3">in the Geekbench 6 database</a> today, providing a closer look at the chip's CPU performance improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
Based on the results so far, the M3 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 3,000 and 11,700, respectively. The standard M2 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 2,600 and 9,700, respectively, so the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip, as Apple claimed during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">"Scary Fast" event</a> on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench 6 multi-core scores:<ul><li><strong>M3 chip:</strong> ~11,700 (+20% vs. M2 chip)</li><br/>
<li><strong>M2 chip:</strong> ~9,700 (+17% vs. M1 chip)</li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 chip:</strong> ~8,315</li></ul>It's unclear if the results are for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro or iMac, both of which are available with the standard M3 chip, but performance should be similar for both machines. The results have a "Mac15,3" identifier, which <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-14/apple-ramps-up-testing-of-new-macbooks-ahead-of-summer-launch">reported</a> was for a laptop with the same display resolution as a 14-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The standard M3 chip is equipped with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, and it supports up to 24GB of unified memory. The chip has improved GPU architecture with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, which will make high-end games look more realistic. It also has a 16-core Neural Engine for AI.<br/>

We have yet to see any Geekbench results for the higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max chips available in most new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/">Benchmarks</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">First Benchmark Results Surface for M3 Chip in New Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-benchmark-results-surface-for-m3-chip-in-new-macs.2409507/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has refreshed the MacBook Pro's hardware with a full set of M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, but what exactly do the latest machines bring to the table and is it worth upgrading from the previous generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/MacBook-Pro-2021-2023-and-2023-Buyers-Guide-Feature-1.875.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920052" /><br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip starts at &#36;1,599, replacing the previous <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> 13-inch model as the entry-level machine in Apple's pro notebook lineup. Equipped with the higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, the 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,999 and the 16-inch model starts at &#36;2,499.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the launch of the latest models, previous-generation MacBook Pro models have been discontinued and are no longer available from Apple's main storefront. Units of slightly older machines such as the 2021 and early 2023 models may, however, still be available via Apple's refurbished store and third-party retailers for significantly reduced prices. Buying a 2021 or early 2023 model second-hand is also an option.<br/>
<br/>
First-time MacBook Pro‌ customers or those upgrading from a much older device may be wondering whether it is worth buying a 2021 or early 2023 model, so it will be important to weigh up exactly what was added with the latest version. Likewise, existing users of the 2021 or early 2023 MacBook Pro may be wondering if it is worth upgrading to the latest model or sticking with their current device.<br/>
<br/>
See the detailed breakdown below for each new feature, change, and improvement that was added with the late 2023's ‌14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models compared to their predecessors:<br/>

The late 2023 MacBook Pro models are relatively minor improvements over their direct predecessors that primarily focus on performance improvements. Beyond their chips, the early 2023 MacBook Pro introduced support for Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1, and added an extra hour of battery life. The late 2023 MacBook Pro added an extra 100 nits of SDR brightness, AV1 decode, and a Space Black color option. Accumulatively, this makes for quite a small upgrade for existing users of the 2021 MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing which 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro model to buy ultimately comes down to what level of performance you require. For example, the M3 series of chips feature a redesigned GPU with hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, which may be an attractive upgrade for some users, but it is far from essential for the vast majority. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro users who are mulling an upgrade to an M3 Pro machine should also be aware that it features reduced memory bandwidth and one less GPU core. <br/>
<br/>
Generally, unless you need peak performance for demanding professional workflows, it will not be worth upgrading from a 2021 MacBook Pro to a 2023 model, or from an early 2023 machine to a late 2023 model. Only those who need the M3's redesigned GPU and hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, or more than 12 CPU cores, 38 GPU cores, or 96GB memory will really benefit.<br/>

For those who have not yet made the leap to an Apple silicon machine, the 2021 and early 2023 MacBook Pro models are still very good options if you can get them for a significantly low price. It is only worth paying more to get the latest model if you want a future-proof device to keep for the long term, where slightly better performance, battery life, and specifications like Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1 are likely to be more beneficial through successive software updates and as connectivity needs with other devices evolve. Even then, it is difficult to recommend buying a late 2023 MacBook Pro at full price over an equivalent, heavily discounted early 2023 model.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you are considering upgrading across the product lineup, such as going from a 2021 or early 2023 14-inch MacBook Pro to a 16-inch model, it may be worth buying the latest model to capture its handful of other improvements.<br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip effectively replaces the previous 13-inch MacBook Pro, which featured the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip in 2020 and the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in 2022. For users of these older MacBook Pro models, the new low-cost 14-inch model represents a substantial upgrade, featuring a larger display with a mini-LED panel, a 1080p camera, a six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers, an HDMI 2.1 port and an SDXC card slot, fast charging and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> 3, and two extra hours of battery life.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-pro-upgraders-buyers-guide/">2023 MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 20+ Differences Compared Across Generations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2023-macbook-pro-buyers-guide-20-differences-compared-across-generations.2377515/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to add blood pressure monitoring and sleep apnea detection to an Apple Watch with an updated design in 2024, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-11-01/apple-health-blood-pressure-glucose-sleep-apnea-team-issues">report</a> covering the arc of Apple's heath-related ambitions, Gurman outlines the first iteration of the company's "pathbreaking" blood pressure sensor technology coming next year that will include hypertension detection:<br/>
<blockquote>The system is designed to just tell a user if their blood pressure is trending upward and to offer a journal for the user to jot down what was happening when hypertension occurred. To avoid potentially giving a misdiagnosis, the feature will then direct a user to talk to their doctor or check their blood pressure with a traditional cuff, which can provide exact systolic and diastolic measurements. </blockquote>A future version of the system in development can provide exact numbers and even diagnose related conditions, according to Gurman. However, these enhancements "remain far off," he adds.<br/>
<br/>
Also coming in 2024 is an Apple Watch-based sleep apnea detection feature. According to the report, it will use sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition, and then direct users to see a physician.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-watch-blood-glucose-up-to-seven-years-away/">previously reported</a>, Apple is also working on non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. Apple's system is said to use a silicon photonics chip to shine light from a laser under the skin to determine the concentration of glucose in the body.<br/>
<br/>
The glucose monitoring has been designed in a similar way to the blood pressure system, in that it currently monitors how a person's blood sugar is trending and warns users of pre-diabetes, rather than offer an actual blood sugar reading.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple's blood glucose monitoring efforts remain unlikely to show up in a product for "at least a few years," according to Gurman's latest report, citing people with knowledge of the efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Away from Apple Watch, Apple is also said to be on course to bring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/12/gurman-airpods-to-gain-hearing-health-features/">hearing aid detection</a> to AirPods in 2024. Equipped with the new feature, AirPods will be able to function as an over-the-counter hearing aid and be able to perform the hearing tests typically administered in audiologists' offices.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Apple is said to be continuing to explore ways to make the upcoming Apple Vision Pro headset into a health device, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-explores-vision-pro-health-capabilities/">reported previously</a> by <em>The Information</em>. Anti-anxiety and enhanced meditation features are being worked on, as well as a virtual-reality system to reinforce positive thinking and improve mental health.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also been studying using the sensors in the device to scan a wearer's eyes for cognitive health data, while a headset version of Fitness+ "remains on the table," according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>Bloomberg</em> report additionally includes some interesting backstory on Apple's evolving health and healthcare initiatives in recent years, as well as an update on the company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/apple-primary-healthcare-service-wsj/">paid health coaching service in development</a>.
