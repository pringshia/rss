		<description><![CDATA[Even though iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2 added multiple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, Writing Tools, and more, there are still new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; capabilities that we're waiting on. Apple has at least one more major &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; update coming in 2025, and the functionality that we're expecting is outlined below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963424" /><br/>
<h2>Priority Notifications</h2><br/>
Notification summaries are already available on devices that support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, but in a future version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; will have Priority Notifications so you can see what's important first while filtering out things that don't matter as much.<br/>
<br/>
When Priority Notifications launch, incoming notifications that are marked as priority will show up on the top of the notification stack.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Siri Features</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> already has a new design and a better understanding of natural language on &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; devices, but there are several &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; changes that haven't been added yet.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is getting support for personal context, onscreen awareness, and deeper app integration. Personal context will allow &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to keep track of everything on your device, like text messages, emails, files, and photos, so &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can help you find anything you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
With onscreen awareness, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will know what you're looking at on your device, and will be able to complete actions. If you're viewing a photo, for example, you'll be able to ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to send it to someone just by saying "Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, send this" and the person's name. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will understand what "this" is.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is also going to be able to do a lot more in apps and between apps, which is likely going to make the biggest change in &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s ability to get things done. You'll be able to edit a photo and send it to someone all with a single command, or move files from one app to another using &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. The way Apple describes it, it's going to be similar to Shortcuts, but activated all via &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; with no need to set anything up.<br/>
<br/>
These all sound like fairly invasive &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; able to track everything on a device, but Apple plans on doing these things on-device to preserve privacy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Genmoji on macOS</h2><br/>
Apple added &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with the launch of iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2, but it wasn't added to the Mac in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2. We already know &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/macos-sequoia-15-3-genmoji-for-mac/">in the macOS Sequoia 15.3 update</a> that Apple is beta testing, and that update is expected in January 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Memory Movies for macOS</h2><br/>
Macs are also missing the memory movies feature that is designed to let you create a slideshow from your photos and videos using just a text description. Right now, making a memory movie is limited to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, but Apple does plan to add it to the Mac too.<br/>
<br/>
You can create a custom memory movie by going to the Memories section in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app, tapping on Create, and then typing in the description of the movie that you want to see. The &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app will pick out the most logical photos and videos that fit the theme you've specified, creating a slideshow set to music. You can edit the photos that are included, change the music, and share the result on social media.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence in More Languages and Additional Countries</h2><br/>
Apple is going to add support for languages beyond English in 2025, including Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>When We'll Get New Apple Intelligence Features</h2><br/>
Beyond &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; for the Mac, there aren't new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features in the current iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.3 updates that Apple is beta testing right now, so we're not expecting new capabilities until iOS 18.4.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.3 will likely see a launch in late January, and then we'll get the iOS 18.4 beta. iOS 18.4 and its sister updates will be beta tested for a couple months, with Apple planning for an April 2024 launch.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/27/five-apple-intelligence-features-2025/">Five Apple Intelligence Features Coming in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/five-apple-intelligence-features-coming-in-2025.2446235/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Christmas has come to an end, and with it many of the season's biggest discounts have expired. However, you can still find some great deals on Apple products today, including an all-time low price on the AirTag 4-Pack, as well as some solid deals on Apple Watch and MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Hero0008.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847998" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

<h2>Accessories</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/airtag-red.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982159" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;29 OFF</div>AirTag 4-Pack for &#36;69.99</div></a></div><br/>

<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHHJXTC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;14 OFF</div>2-meter MagSafe Charger for &#36;34.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple's AirTag 4-Pack returned to its all-time low price of &#36;69.99 about a week ago on Amazon, and it's still there even after the Christmas holiday has ended. If you're planning to travel a lot in 2025, this is a great accessory to pick up, especially at this price.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/airpods-red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920811" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHMNQ5Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;10 OFF</div>AirPods 4 for &#36;119.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
<h2>iPad</h2><br/>

<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has released the first eight minutes of the highly anticipated Severance season two premiere as a special preview for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ subscribers, following the show's nearly three-year hiatus.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-TV-Plus-Severance-Season-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1104" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-958238" /><br/>
The exclusive preview, now available in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app under the Bonus Content section of the Severance page, gives fans their first look at the next chapter of the sci-fi thriller. Mark Scout, portrayed by Adam Scott, returns to work at Lumon Industries, grappling with the fallout of events that blurred the carefully maintained boundary between his work and personal identities.<br/>
<br/>
Severance first debuted on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ in February 2022 and quickly became one of the platform's standout series, earning multiple Emmy nominations. Created by Dan Erickson and produced by Ben Stiller, Severance examines a futuristic workplace where employees undergo a controversial medical procedure to split their work and personal memories, creating two distinct lives within a single individual. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting today, the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and third-generation iPhone SE have been fully removed from Apple's online store in most EU countries, due to an imminently-effective <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/04/eu-passes-law-to-switch-iphone-to-usb-c-in-2024/">regulation</a> that requires smartphones with wired charging capabilities that are newly placed for sale to be equipped with a USB-C port in the EU.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-14-Yellow-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887953" /><br/>
The trio of iPhone models are no longer listed on Apple's online store in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and most other EU countries. The devices have also been unlisted in a few other countries that participate in the EU's single market, such as Switzerland.<br/>
<br/>
The regulation comes into force on December 28, and it applies to any individual iPhone unit placed for sale after that date, even if they are older models. While all iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models are equipped with USB-C ports for wired charging, the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and current iPhone SE still have Lightning ports.<br/>
<br/>
The UK left the EU in 2020, so it is not impacted by this regulation. Northern Ireland is affected, however, as it still participates in the EU's single market.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/20/iphone-14-iphone-se-unavailable-in-switzerland/">began phasing out</a> the trio of iPhone models in the EU market last week, and it still has to delist the devices in a few more EU countries. In-store availability at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Resellers will likely be hit or miss over the next few days, as any remaining inventory is depleted. But, by and large, the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE are no longer available from Apple in the EU.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/iphone-se-4-expected-to-launch-in-march/">fourth-generation iPhone SE with a USB-C port in March</a>, so the device should quickly return to the EU. Meanwhile, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus likely would have been discontinued in September had the USB-C regulation not existed, so sales of those devices are ending in the EU around nine months early.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is on the brink of becoming the first company in history to surpass a &#36;4 trillion market valuation, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/12/27/apple-ai-4-trillion-market-cap/"><em>Fortune</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1504" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-834996" /><br/>
Apple's stock (AAPL) has nearly risen 40% in 2024. Before the markets opened on December 27, Apple's market capitalization stood at &#36;3.92 trillion, leaving the company just a modest surge in stock value away from the unprecedented milestone. The growth is said to have been fueled largely by optimism surrounding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> and the continued strength of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> upgrade cycles. <br/>
<br/>
In a research note published on December 26, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said that Apple is entering a "golden era of growth" with its AI initiatives serving as a pivotal driver. Ives increased his price target for Apple's stock to &#36;325, citing the company's ongoing efforts to embed artificial intelligence into its products. He emphasized that Apple's current AI strategy is likely underestimated by the market, adding that the development of hundreds of applications under the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; platform will provide "another growth catalyst along with catalyzing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; upgrades across the board over the next 12 to 18 months."<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>We believe Apple is heading into a multi-year AI-driven iPhone upgrade cycle that is still being underestimated by the Street. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will Apple's AI strategy but the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.<br/>
<br/>
We estimate that with hundreds of apps in development around Apple Intelligence that in essence creates a new multi-billion annual Services revenue stream will be another growth catalyst along with catalyzing iPhone upgrades across the board over the next 12 to 18 months. We believe Apple is on pace to reach the &#36;4 trillion market cap threshold and be the first member of this exclusive club.<br/>
</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee also predicts sustained growth for Apple, driven by its ability to expand its installed base of devices, which surpassed two billion active units globally in 2023. Chatterjee pointed to "the transformation of the company to services" and the continued evolution of its product lineup as key factors in its success. He also highlighted Apple's focus on capital deployment, with the company consistently returning value to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, which have totaled hundreds of billions of dollars in recent years.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's nearest competitors in terms of market capitalization, Microsoft and Nvidia, have also benefited from advancements in AI but trail behind with valuations of &#36;3.26 trillion and &#36;3.43 trillion, respectively. Both companies are investing heavily in their own AI platforms, with Nvidia's GPU technology playing a central role in powering generative AI applications. However, Apple's long-term advantage seemingly lies in its ability to control both hardware and software, potentially allowing it to deliver a superior user experience across its ecosystem.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortune-com/">Fortune</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jpmorgan/">JPMorgan</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wedbush/">Wedbush</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/27/apple-set-to-become-first-4-trillion-company/">Apple Set to Become First &#36;4 Trillion Company</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-set-to-become-first-4-trillion-company.2446208/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest iPhones include several headline camera features that are worth using, such as Portrait Mode and Photographic Styles. But if all you want to use is the standard photo mode, there are still several tools and settings that can improve the composition of your pictures and help you capture the perfect shot using more traditional techniques.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Blue-Three-Quarters-Perspective-Camera-Closeup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909012" /><br/>
Whether you are the owner of a new iPhone or a longtime user looking to up your photography game, here are six camera tools and settings in iOS that are worth checking out and experimenting with.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="1._use_the_rule_of_thirds">1. Use the Rule of Thirds</h2><br/>
For a while now, Apple's Camera app has included a few optional settings that can help you line up your shots. Foremost in these settings is the Grid tool, which should be used when applying the rule of thirds. It divides the frame of your photo into a grid with two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, creating nine equal parts. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/grid-camera-tool.jpg" alt="" width="2716" height="1339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927774" /><br/>
The rule of thirds helps guide the viewer's eye to the most important parts of your photo and creates a more harmonious composition. Here's how to overlay a grid on the viewfinder.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap Camera. </li><br/>
<li>In the "Composition" section, toggle on the switch next to Grid.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/camera-grid-setting.jpg" alt="settings" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927655" /><br/>
<br/>
Here are five things to keep in mind when using the grid to apple the rule of thirds.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Identify the Key Elements</strong>: First, identify the main subjects or elements in the scene you want to photograph. These could be a person, a building, a tree, or any focal point.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Positioning the Subjects</strong>: Place these key elements along the lines or at the points where the lines intersect. For instance, if you're taking a photo of a person, you might position them along one of the vertical lines, rather than in the center of the frame.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Horizontal Elements</strong>: For horizontal elements like the horizon in a landscape, align them with one of the horizontal lines. For a more dramatic sky, place the horizon on the lower line. For more emphasis on the land or sea, place it on the upper line.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Balancing the Image</strong>: Use the rule of thirds to balance your photo. If you place a subject on the left, consider having something of lesser importance on the right to create a sense of balance.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Experimentation</strong>: While the rule of thirds is a guideline, it's not a strict rule. Feel free to experiment with it and see how shifting elements in your frame changes the photo's impact.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2._straighten_top-down_shots">2. Straighten Top-Down Shots</h2><br/>
If you're taking a picture of something from above like a plate of food or an ornament on the ground, consider using the camera level, as it helps you capture a balanced shot without having to use a tripod arm or mount. It's also useful for taking a shot of something directly above you, like an object on the ceiling or in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/level-camera-tool-setting.jpg" alt="" width="1338" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927776" /><br/>
The camera level tool used to be part of the Grid overlay, but Apple separated out the function in iOS 17, and it now has its own switch: Open the Settings app on your iPhone, select Camera, then toggle on the switch next to Level. Now you are ready to use it.<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Open the Camera app, and set the capture mode to <strong>Photo</strong>, <strong>Portrait</strong>, <strong>Square</strong>, or <strong>Time Lapse</strong>, using the sliding menu above the shutter button.</li><br/>
<li>Point the camera straight down above your subject (or straight up if the subject/scene you want to capture is above you).</li><br/>
<li>Line up the floating crosshair with the fixed crosshair in the center of the screen by adjusting the angle of your phone's camera. The crosshairs will both glow yellow when in perfect alignment. </li><br/>
<li>Tap the shutter button to capture the shot.</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/camera-level-tool-in-action.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1058" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927779" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The aligned crosshairs turn yellow (right), indicating the lens is parallel with the ground.</em></div><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="3._straighten_your_horizontal_shots">3. Straighten Your Horizontal Shots</h2><br/>
By making the Level tool an individual option in iOS 17, Apple has also included an additional horizontal level for more traditional straight-on photos.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-camera-level-no.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899126" /><br/>
Turning the Level option on makes a broken horizontal line appear on the screen when your iPhone senses that you're lining up for a straight-on shot and you tilt your device slightly out of horizontal. The line appears white while your phone is out of level and then turns yellow once you achieve a level orientation to indicate success.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-camera-level.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899127" /><br/>
With the Level setting enabled (Settings ➝ Camera ➝ Level), try it for yourself. Open the Camera app and try shooting a subject at a straight angle, and you should see the broken horizontal lines in the center of the viewfinder. Straighten your angle up to connect the lines and make a single yellow line.<br/>
<br/>
The leveling pop-up only appears briefly and only within a narrow range of angles close to horizontal (in either portrait or landscape orientation), so it won't intrusively pop up when you're intentionally trying to take a photo at an angle.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="4._take_burst_photos">4. Take Burst Photos</h2><br/>
Burst Mode refers to when the camera on your iPhone captures a series of photos in rapid succession, at a rate of ten frames per second. It's a great way to shoot an action scene or an unexpected event, since you're always more likely to end up with the picture you were aiming for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/burstmode.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="460" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-386450" /><br/>
To shoot in Burst Mode, go to Settings ➝ Camera and toggle on <strong>Use Volume Up for Burst</strong>, then simply long press on the Volume Up button when in the Camera app, and your iPhone will take a series of photos in quick succession. Notice that a counter increases inside the on-screen shutter button for as long as you hold down the volume button. This indicates how many shots are being captured in the current burst. Simply take your finger off the volume when you want to end the burst of shots.<br/>
<br/>
When you take a series of burst photos, they automatically appear in the Photos app under the Album name Bursts. You'll also find them in your main Photo Library. Follow the link to learn <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/delete-redundant-burst-mode-photos-iphone-ipad/">how to view and select the best of your Burst photos</a> in the Photos app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="5._mirror_your_selfies">5. Mirror Your Selfies</h2><br/>
When you take a selfie with your iPhone using the Camera app, it automatically flips – or mirrors – the image so that it's an inverted version of the mirror image you see in the preview before you take the shot.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/stop-flipped-selfie-iphone-ipad.jpg" alt="selfie" width="2710" height="2616" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757877" /><br/>
This can look odd, since it makes a big difference to how selfies look. It can also be annoying, since most third-party social media apps automatically take mirrored selfies, which means you're more likely to be used to the mirroring functionality than the flipped selfies that your ‌iPhone‌ takes.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, you can change this default behavior of the Camera app, meaning that you can get the mirrored selfie you're probably more accustomed to seeing. Here's how.<br/>
<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app, then scroll down and select <strong>Camera</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle the switch next to <strong>Mirror Front Camera</strong> to the green ON position.</li></ol><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/mirror-front-camera-setting.jpg" alt="settings" width="1338" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927784" /><br/>
That's all there is to it. From now on when you use the Camera app to shoot a selfie, you'll capture the same shot that you saw in the app's preview mode.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="6._view_outside_the_frame">6. View Outside the Frame</h2><br/>
On iPhone 11 and later models, there is an optional camera setting that allows you to see what is outside the bounds of your photo's frame, so you can correct the alignment of photos (and videos) without having to resort to cropping.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/capture-shot-outside-frame-iphone-11-camera-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927787" /><br/>
With the "View Outside the Frame" setting enabled, using the wide lens or the telephoto lens, the camera will simultaneously show you the lens view using the next widest sensor. So the wide lens is active when you view with the telephoto lens, and the ultra-wide is active when the wide lens is selected. <br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Camera</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under the "Composition" section, toggle on the switch next to View Outside the Frame.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/view-outside-frame-setting.jpg" alt="settings" width="1338" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927786" /><br/>
<br/>
You may have to play around with zoom levels to switch between lenses, but you'll know the feature is active when the camera interface turns semi-transparent to reveal the surroundings outside of the viewfinder.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/6-iphone-camera-tips-to-enhance-your-photography-skills/">6 iPhone Camera Tips to Enhance Your Photography Skills</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/6-iphone-camera-tips-to-enhance-your-photography-skills.2446204/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week began teasing some kind of upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ surprise that's set to happen on January 4 and January 5, telling customers to "stay tuned" and "save the date" in social media posts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/apple-tv-plus-teaser.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-983543" /><br/>
Apple's images have a tagline that says "See for yourself," but it isn't clear what Apple has planned. Some users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tvPlus/comments/1hm2dro/save_the_date/">Reddit have speculated</a> that Apple might be planning to launch a promotion that gives people free access to &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ for a two-day period, though others believe that it could be a preview for upcoming 2025 TV shows.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stay tuned. <a href="https://t.co/ph7k2Wh75G">pic.twitter.com/ph7k2Wh75G</a></p>&mdash; Apple TV (@AppleTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV/status/1872298393172865218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
January 4 and January 5 fall on a weekend, and the "see for yourself" wording does seem to suggest that a free watching period could be a possibility. Apple may share additional information in the days leading up to the "event" that gives us more insight.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has never done a free all-you-can-watch &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ event, but it does offer free trials for new subscribers and it provides the first episodes of some shows so that potential customers can get a preview before choosing to subscribe.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ is priced at &#36;9.99 per month, and up to six members of a Family Sharing group are able to watch content at that price point.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/26/apple-tv-plus-january-teaser/">Apple Teases Apple TV+ Surprise on January 4 and 5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-teases-apple-tv-surprise-on-january-4-and-5.2446161/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a new ad promoting the Apple Watch Series 10, linking it to the tradition of setting New Year's resolutions.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Apple Watch Quit Quitting Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2jhL5jMOCM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
In the spot, Apple explains that the second Friday of January is when most people stop meeting their goals, suggesting that the Apple Watch can provide the necessary motivation to keep going.<br/>
<br/>
"This year, what if a little bit of help on our wrists could help us quit, quitting?" asks the ad, followed by the tagline "motivation on your wrist."<br/>
<br/>
Apple highlights the Apple Watch notifications for closing activity rings and meeting workout goals, along with specific running-focused features such as the option to track pace and get alerts to step it up.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/26/apple-watch-fitness-motivational-ad/">Apple Watch Will Motivate You to Meet Your 2025 Fitness Goals, Apple Says in New Ad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-will-motivate-you-to-meet-your-2025-fitness-goals-apple-says-in-new-ad.2446154/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following our report that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/21/apple-preparing-ios-18-2-1/">internally testing iOS 18.2.1 for the iPhone</a>, an anonymous social media account with a proven track record of sharing iOS-related information has revealed the upcoming software update's build number: 22C161.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
With the build number now known, the update is now confirmed. <br/>
<br/>
When the anonymous account shares a build number for an upcoming iOS version, the update is usually released no more than a week later. However, given it is currently the holiday season, it could take longer for the update to be released. We continue to respect the account's request that we not link to their social media posts.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2.1 should be a minor update that fixes bugs and/or addresses security vulnerabilities, but it is unclear which specific issues might be resolved. There are not any critical, widespread bugs that we know about at this particular time, but Apple has obviously identified various bugs and/or security vulnerabilities that it wants to patch ahead of iOS 18.3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/apple-releases-ios-18-3-beta-1/">testing iOS 18.3</a> with developers and public beta testers earlier this month. That update is likely to be released to all users in January or early February, and only minor changes have been discovered in it so far.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/24/ios-18-2-1-confirmed/">iOS 18.2.1 for iPhone Now Confirmed as iOS 18.3 Beta Testing Continues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-2-1-for-iphone-now-confirmed-as-ios-18-3-beta-testing-continues.2446063/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's senior vice president of services Eddy Cue has explained why the iPhone maker does not plan to create a search engine like Google.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/applegoogle.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-736930" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zgvoalybovd/apple%20declaration.pdf">declaration</a> filed with a U.S. federal court in Washington, D.C. last week, Cue said Apple is against the idea for the following reasons:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>The development of a search engine would cost Apple "billions of dollars" and "take many years," and this would divert investment money and employees away from "other growth areas" that the company is focused on.</li><br/>
<li>The search business is "rapidly evolving" due to artificial intelligence, so it would be "economically risky" for Apple to create a search engine.</li><br/>
<li>In order to create a "viable" search engine business, Apple would be required to "sell targeted advertising," which is "not a core business" for the company and would go against its "longstanding privacy commitments."</li><br/>
<li>Apple does not have enough "specialized professionals" and "operational infrastructure" needed to build and run a successful search engine business.</li></ul>Earlier this year, as part of the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust trial against Google, the court declared that the deal that sees Google set as the default search engine in Apple's web browser Safari <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/google-search-antitrust-monopoly/">is illegal</a>. In his declaration, Cue asked the court to allow Apple to defend the deal by having its own witnesses testify during the trial.<br/>
<br/>
"Only Apple can speak to what kinds of future collaborations can best serve its users," wrote Cue. "Apple is relentlessly focused on creating the best user experience possible and explores potential partnerships and arrangements with other companies to make that happen."<br/>
<br/>
As part of the deal, Cue revealed that Google paid Apple roughly &#36;20 billion in 2022 alone.<br/>
<br/>
If the agreement can no longer continue, Cue said "it would hamstring Apple's ability to continue delivering products that best serve its users' needs."<br/>
<br/>
The declaration was earlier <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-seeks-defend-googles-billion-dollar-payments-search-case-2024-12-24/">reported <em>by Reuters</em></a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/24/apple-explains-why-it-wont-make-search-engine/">Apple Explains Why It Doesn&#039;t Plan to Create a Search Engine</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-why-it-doesnt-plan-to-create-a-search-engine.2446055/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With such a wide array of products now available, Apple devices will be under the Christmas trees of many families this season. However, there are three that are most likely to be there.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/m4-ipad-pro-snowflakes.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-979386" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/20055/items-brands-most-often-mentioned-as-a-top-item-on-teens-holiday-wishlist/">Piper Jaffray</a> surveys, Apple is constantly among the most desired brands among teens, appearing in 10% of all holiday wish lists, far ahead of competitors like Nike and Louis Vuitton.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>AirPods</h3><br/>
AirPods are one of the most popular tech gifts during the holidays. In a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1350738/top-tech-gifts-by-number-of-buyers-us/">2022 Statista survey</a>, headphones and earbuds were ranked as the most sought-after tech gift, with 61 million U.S. adults planning to buy them during the season.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/airpods-4-holiday.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-981158" /><br/>
Given Apple's popularity and AirPods' market dominance, it's likely they make up a significant portion of these purchases. Their relatively affordable price point compared to other Apple products, combined with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#airpods">frequent discounts</a>, cements their place as a top holiday gift.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recently released the fourth-generation AirPods in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4-vs-airpods-4-with-anc-buyers-guide-which-should-you-choose/">two variants</a>: one entry-level model for &#36;129 and one higher-end model with active noise cancellation and wireless charging for &#36;179, which is also likely to drive gifting around this time of year.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Apple Watch</h3><br/>
The Apple Watch has become a go-to gift for all ages, and its popularity as a holiday gift continues to grow. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/apple-watch-bands.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-980992" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/holiday-iphones-ipads-and-macs-maybe">recent data</a> from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), 9% of Apple Watch owners reported receiving their watch as a gift during the holiday season, compared to just 2% the rest of the year. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has expanded the Apple Watch lineup since 2020, adding the low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> and the premium Apple Watch Ultra, offering three distinctly different models that cater to a wide range of users and budgets. Somewhat similar to AirPods, Apple Watches <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#apple_watch">frequently see discounts</a> and the &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; starts at just &#36;249, making it an ideal gift.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>iPad</h3><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> remains a popular holiday gift, particularly for families and students, thanks to its versatility and range of models catering to different needs. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ipad-air-black-friday.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-975372" /><br/>
CIRP data shows that 6% of &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; buyers received their device as a gift during the holiday season, compared to just 2% in other quarters.<br/>
<br/>
The 10th generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, starting at &#36;349, offers a highly accessible excellent entry point into Apple's tablet lineup. With its 10.9-inch display, A14 Bionic chip, and support for accessories like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> and Magic Keyboard Folio, it's a good choice for anyone seeking a low-cost, all-purpose device for entertainment or light productivity. For those looking to spend more, Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> provide additional options.<br/>
<br/>
Like the AirPods and Apple Watch, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; often sees <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#ipad">discounts</a> in the lead up to the holiday period, ensuring that it remains one of the most popular holiday gifts.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>What About iPhones and Macs?</h3><br/>
Despite their popularity, Apple's other flagship products—the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Mac—are rarely given as gifts. CIRP data indicates that close to 0% of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; buyers and just 1% of Mac buyers received their devices as gifts during the holiday season. The reasons for this are relatively straightforward: both products are expensive, and gifting them often involves somewhat more complex buying decisions, such as signing up for carrier plans or selecting memory configurations.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A new Apple TV streaming box is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/">rumored to launch next year</a>, and there is a possibility that the device's U.S. pricing will start at just &#36;99.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-tv-4k-new-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953895" /><br/>
Shortly after the current Apple TV 4K model launched in October 2022, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the next Apple TV would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">"more affordable" than the current model</a>. He said a "sub-&#36;100 price" would be the "sweet spot" for the Apple TV, but exact pricing for the next model remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
Both the 2010 and 2012 versions of the Apple TV were priced at &#36;99 in the U.S. at launch, and Apple eventually lowered the price of the 2012 model to &#36;69, so there is precedent for a sub-&#36;100 Apple TV that would better compete with lower-priced streaming devices like the Google TV Streamer, which costs &#36;99.99. Amazon and Roku have even cheaper streaming stick options starting as low as &#36;24.99 on sale.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., the current Apple TV starts at &#36;129 with 64GB of storage, and a 128GB model with an added Ethernet port is available for &#36;149.<br/>
<br/>
Rumored features for the next Apple TV include a faster A-series chip and Wi-Fi 6E support.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">built-in camera has also been rumored</a> for a future Apple TV model. tvOS 17 added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expected to release an AirTag 2 next year, and a few new features and changes have already been rumored for the item tracker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/AirTag-and-Lavender-iPhone.jpg" alt="" width="1001" height="563" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-796089" /><br/>
Below, we recap what to expect from the AirTag 2:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>The new AirTag is expected to be equipped with Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/airtag-2-longer-range-rumor/"><strong>longer range</strong></a>. The chip debuted last year in the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Apple said it offers up to three times the range as its first-generation Ultra Wideband chip in the current AirTag. On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models, there is a Precision Finding feature that can help you to find your friends in busy places, and it offers up to approximately 60 meters (around 200 feet) range. The new AirTag could offer similar range.</li><br/>
<li>The new AirTag's <strong>built-in speaker is expected to be more difficult to remove</strong>, as a stalking-related safety measure.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the holiday season, capturing photos and videos of the festivities with family and friends is an important activity for many. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> has a suite of camera features that can significantly elevate the quality and creativity of your holiday photos and videos. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Five-iPhone-Camera-Features-to-Try-This-Holiday-Season-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-927844" /><br/>
It's easy to forget about many of the individual camera features the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has to offer, and many capabilities go unused by most users, so the holidays is the perfect time to revisit them and try something new. For users of Apple's latest models, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> takes things even further with several enhanced camera features and the all-new Camera Control.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Spatial Video Capture</h3><br/>
For users of more recent &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, the holiday season presents an ideal opportunity to experiment with Spatial Video capture feature. Available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max, and all &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, the feature allows users to record videos in a three-dimensional format, bringing a new level of depth and realism to holiday memories.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-apple-visioin-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911687" /><br/>
While Apple's Vision Pro or a device like the Meta Quest 3 is required for the best experience when playing back Spatial Video, this should not deter users from exploring the feature. Spatial Video capture is available to help users begin creating a library of immersive videos right away, regardless of whether they have a headset device yet. Spatial Videos can also be played back as normal 2D content on other devices.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/record-spatial-video-iphone/">How to Record Spatial Video</a></li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The technology behind Spatial Video Capture involves using the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s Main and Ultra Wide cameras. When recording, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; seamlessly combines inputs from these cameras to create a single video file that encapsulates a three-dimensional perspective. This is achieved through sophisticated computational videography techniques, which intelligently scale the field of view from the Ultra Wide camera to match that of the Main camera.<br/>
<br/>
The result is a video that, while technically 2D in format, contains depth information that can be utilized by compatible devices to produce a 3D viewing experience. The spatial dimension added to these videos creates a sense of immersion and presence that far surpasses traditional video, supposedly making the viewer feel as if they are actually part of the captured moment. However, it's worth noting that Spatial Video capture works best in good lighting. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Ultra Wide-Angle Lens for Group Shots</h3><br/>
The holiday season presents the perfect opportunity to utilize the often under-utilized Ultra Wide camera lens. This lens, available on most &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models starting from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11, offers unique advantages that are particularly useful during the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/12/iphone-11-pro-ultra-wide.jpg" alt="" width="2264" height="1186" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-722975" /><br/>
The Ultra Wide lens is particularly adept at photography in confined spaces that would be difficult to capture fully with the standard Wide lens. One of the most significant advantages of the Ultra Wide lens is its ability to fit more into the frame without needing to move back, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; displays the Ultra Wide camera's feed outside the frame of the Wide camera by default in the camera app. This is especially helpful during family gatherings where you might want to capture a large group of people in one photo.<br/>
<br/>
The Ultra Wide camera got a considerable upgrade with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, jumping to 48-megapixels to match the Main camera, resulting in considerably sharper, higher-resolution output and better low-light performance.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Cinematic Mode</h3><br/>
The holiday season is a good time for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 and newer model users to try out Cinematic mode, a feature that adds a depth-of-field effect to videos. Cinematic mode uses advanced computational algorithms to automatically focus on subjects and creatively blur the background, akin to what you would see in high-end cinematography. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Cinematic-Mode-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-900525" /><br/>
Cinematic mode allows users to focus on details in a creative way, by shifting focus smoothly from one subject to another. Cinematic mode also simplifies capturing these moments by automatically adjusting focus when people enter or leave the frame, or when the subject of the video looks in a different direction. <br/>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/shoot-video-in-cinematic-mode-iphone-13-iphone-14/">How to Shoot Video in Cinematic Mode</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Photographic Styles</h3><br/>
Photographic Styles, a feature introduced in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 series, offers a personalized photography experience that can help enhance holiday photos. The feature allows users to choose and customize a photographic style that automatically applies to their photos, ensuring that every shot reflects their preferred aesthetic. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/photographic-styles-iphone-13.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-817882" /><br/>
Photographic Styles are not one-size-fits-all filters. Instead, they are smart adjustments that apply selectively to different parts of the photo, such as skin tones and sky. Photographic Styles intelligently adapt to the lighting conditions in each shot, adjusting to preserve natural-looking skin tones and textures.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-16-photographic-styles/">Customizing Your iPhone 16 Images With Photographic Styles</a></li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-16-edit-photographic-styles-after-shooting/">iPhone 16: Edit Photographic Styles After Shooting</a></li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-photographic-styles-iphone-13-pro/">How to Use Photographic Styles in the Camera App (iPhone 13, 14, and 15)</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Users can choose from preset styles like Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm, and Cool, each offering a unique look. During the holidays, this means you can select a style that best suits the festive mood and give your images a distinctive look.<br/>
<br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup, Apple overhauled Photographic Styles from the ground up. These newer Photographic Styles adjust specific colors in select parts of your photos to adjust the overall appearance, for a more specialized, richer look compared to the previous version.<br/>
<br/>
The first five Photographic Styles are tuned for skin undertones, including Cool Rose, Neutral, Amber, Rose Gold, and Gold. Cool Rose accentuates cool pinkish undertones, while neutral neutralizes warm undertones. Amber, Rose Gold, and Gold accentuate those specific tones. These can be fairly subtle, depending on the settings you choose.<br/>
<br/>
Other Styles are closer to what you get with a filter, adding more dramatic effects that impact the mood of the image. On the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, Photographic Styles can also be added and edited retrospectively. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Enhanced Portrait Mode</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup introduced some substantial improvements to Portrait mode. Now, users can adjust the focus of an image or add background blur after its capture, even if Portrait mode isn't initially selected. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-portrait-photo.jpg" alt="" width="2503" height="1401" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912809" /><br/>
Post-shot editing capability allows you to experiment with different focal points, ensuring that each portrait captures the subject in the most flattering and interesting way. This improvement is especially useful for snapping quick, candid shots of family members and pets over the holiday period. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;'s Portrait mode has also been refined to perform better in low-light conditions.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Lux, the developers behind Halide and Kino, have <a href="https://www.lux.camera/the-road-to-halide-mark-3/">announced</a> their plans for Halide 3.0, a major update slated for release in 2025 with a series of new features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/halide-camera-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-968869" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.lux.camera/the-road-to-halide-mark-3/">Halide "Mark III"</a> is set to gain one-tap color grading. Color grading has been a highly requested addition since the launch of Process Zero, Halide's proprietary image processing system, which debuted in 2024. The feature is expected to allow users to apply professional-grade film looks instantly, similar to the capabilities offered in Lux's Kino app. Lux envisions this feature going beyond presets, potentially enabling users to import custom looks created by others.<br/>
<br/>
While iPhones have long supported HDR through Apple's native algorithms, Halide has refrained from adopting the technology due to concerns over aesthetic preferences and technical compatibility. Lux aims to address these concerns by introducing a nuanced, tasteful HDR implementation that avoids the garish appearance often associated with poorly executed HDR. The timing coincides with advancements in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, particularly the introduction of Adaptive HDR, which extends HDR compatibility to legacy file formats like JPEG. Lux believes this development marks a tipping point for HDR’s broader adoption and plans to integrate the feature alongside its color grading tools.<br/>
<br/>
Lux is also planning to debut a complete redesign of Halide's user interface. With Halide Mark II turning five years old in 2025, Lux has decided it is time for a visual and functional overhaul. The company has hinted that the changes will integrate tightly with the new features, such as making the color grading interface central to the app’s operation. <br/>
<br/>
Lux has launched an <a href="https://discord.gg/cGjhm26X">official Discord server</a>, allowing Halide subscribers to access early builds, share ideas, and participate in discussions to help shape the new version of the app. The server will also host a year-long photography challenge, offering weekly prompts and resources to inspire photographers and encourage engagement within the community.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/halide/">Halide</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/24/halide-three-new-features-in-2025/">Popular iPhone Camera App &#039;Halide&#039; Gaining Three New Features in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/popular-iphone-camera-app-halide-gaining-three-new-features-in-2025.2446046/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nvidia has become one of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/aapl-vs-nvidia-3-trillion-dollar-companies/">world's most valuable companies</a> thanks to strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) server chips from big tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. However, one tech giant that is not a major Nvidia customer is Apple, and a new report attempts to explain why this might be.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-vs-Nvidia.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953774" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-apple-developed-an-nvidia-allergy"><em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma today outlined</a> Apple's historically "bumpy relationship" with Nvidia, but much of the bad blood dates to the 2000s and early 2010s, when Steve Jobs was still CEO and Macs used Nvidia graphics. It is unclear how much these past issues matter today, if at all, and the report acknowledges that Apple's current relationship with Nvidia "isn't entirely acrimonious." Two examples of the companies getting along include Apple's recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/20/apple-nvidia-speed-up-ai-language-models/">collaboration with Nvidia on machine learning research</a>, and Nvidia <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-awe-2024/omniverse-apple-vision-pro">showcasing the Apple Vision Pro</a> when it announced a new software framework earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has mostly rented access to Nvidia GPUs through the cloud from companies like Amazon and Microsoft, and it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-intelligence-servers-new-chip-report/">reportedly developing its own AI server chip</a> as a longer-term solution, but neither of those things prove that Apple still has an "allergy" to Nvidia as the report states. As has been the case for more than a decade, and even more so in recent years, Apple simply wants to develop as many in-house chips and technologies as possible for many reasons, including lower production costs, improved integration between hardware and software, and reduced reliance on external suppliers. So, this seems less about Apple avoiding Nvidia in particular, and more about Apple owning the whole widget in general.<br/>
<br/>
This trend has been playing out for many years now. In addition to Apple long designing its own iPhone chips, the company started releasing its own Mac chips in 2020, in a transition away from Intel. Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-5g-modem-plans-report/">long-rumored 5G modem</a> is expected to begin rolling out in iPhones next year, in a move away from its current supplier Qualcomm. Apple is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">reportedly developing its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a>, a move that will impact Broadcom.<br/>
<br/>
So while Steve Jobs may have once pretended an Nvidia executive was no longer in the room during a meeting, as the report states, it seems most likely that Apple simply has no need to directly purchase GPUs from Nvidia. Apple is clearly fine with renting access to the GPUs from cloud providers until its in-house chip is ready.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-apple-developed-an-nvidia-allergy">The report</a> is nevertheless an interesting read, and it reinforces how Jobs was very good at holding a grudge when he was unhappy with a situation.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nvidia/">Nvidia</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/24/apple-nvidia-relationship-report/">Apple&#039;s Historically &#039;Bumpy Relationship&#039; With Nvidia Detailed in Report</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-historically-bumpy-relationship-with-nvidia-detailed-in-report.2446044/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple has seemingly been on a years-long quest to slim down the bezels on its iPhone models until they vanish out of sight, but it looks like the first "zero-bezel" iPhone is still a few years away yet. According to Korean-language outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=31956">The Elec</a></em>, Apple has been working with Samsung Display and LG Display to develop the revolutionary screen technology, but the work has hit snags.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's vision reportedly differs significantly from existing curved display implementations, such as those previously used in Samsung smartphones or Xiaomi's "quad-curved waterfall display" concept. The iPhone maker is specifically working to avoid the "magnifying glass effect" that typically occurs on curved display edges like those already seen on some smartphones.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast to typical curved-edge phones, Apple is said to envision a unique design that maintains the iPhone's signature flat display and angular sides while extending the screen seamlessly over the edges, similar to the current Apple Watch design. Some industry insiders have reportedly described the intended aesthetic as "pebble-like."<br/>
<br/>
However, the technical challenges apparently remain substantial. Both Samsung Display and LG Display need to adapt two existing technologies, including Thin Film Encapsulation (TFE) for protecting OLED displays from environmental damage, and Optical Clear Adhesive (OCA) for bonding transparent adhesive films around curved edges. The suppliers also need to ensure there's adequate space for components like the iPhone antenna.<br/>
<br/>
The development of OCA technology in particular has reportedly proven troublesome, as the current solutions suffer from side-view distortion issues, and engineers have still to address impact damage concerns for the edge-wrapped display design.<br/>
<br/>
Apple had planned to begin mass production in time for the displays to feature on an iPhone 18 in 2026, but for that to happen, discussions with display manufacturers should have already been finalized by now. However, industry insiders report that these talks are still ongoing, suggesting the timeline for introducing the "zero-bezel" technology on an iPhone will likely slip further into the future.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/">The Elec</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/24/apples-zero-bezel-iphone-delayed-beyond-2026/">Apple&#039;s First Bezel-Free iPhone Unlikely to Be Ready for 2026 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-bezel-free-iphone-unlikely-to-be-ready-for-2026-launch.2446032/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
