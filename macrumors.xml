		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> gaming service with several new titles, including <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/disney-dreamlight-valley/id6456945575">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sonic-dream-team/id1609094795">Sonic Dream Team</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/puzzle-dragons-story/id1636844853">Puzzle & Dragons Story</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/turmoil/id6446276883">Turmoil+</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Disney Dreamlight Valley is a life simulation game starring Disney characters, and it has previously been available on console platforms. The &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; version of the game includes the base version and the A Rift in Time expansion that is a paid option on other platforms.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to other versions of the game, the &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; version does not have in-app purchases and thus does not include Star Path seasons or the Premium Shop.<br/>
<br/>
Sonic Dream Team is a racing game that stars popular Sonic characters, while Puzzle &amp; Dragons Story is an RPG adventure match-3 game. Turmoil+ is an oil rush simulation game that tasks players with digging oil to make money and grow the nearby town.<br/>
<br/>
Many of these games were <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/8-new-games-and-more-than-50-updates-coming-to-apple-arcade-this-holiday-season/">announced back in November</a> following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">October price increase</a> to the &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; service. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; now costs &#36;6.99 per month in the United States, up from &#36;4.99 per month. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; games are free from all in-app purchases and ads.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-arcade-game-additions-december-2023/">Apple Arcade Gains Disney Dreamlight Valley, Puzzle &amp; Dragons Story, and Sonic Dream Team</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-arcade-gains-disney-dreamlight-valley-puzzle-dragons-story-and-sonic-dream-team.2412925/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adventure game "Stray," which is designed to let players take on the role of a daring orange cat, is available for download on the Mac as of today.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="STRAY Launch Trailer" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4uP2MyUL49s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Though the game was first released in 2022, it has been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation consoles until today.<br/>
<br/>
In this third-person adventure title, a stray cat's curiosity causes him to get stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria, and the aim in the game is to get back up to the surface using B-12, the cat's drone companion.<br/>
<br/>
Stray asks players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding security bots and evil bacteria. The game is platform-based, so players will need to climb up various obstacles and interact with the environment to open up new pathways.<br/>
<br/>
Since the main character is a cat, players can sneak, sleep, meow at robots, and nuzzle up to NPCs. Stray is limited to Apple silicon Macs, and it uses Metal Upscaling for accelerated graphics performance and high-quality visuals.<br/>
<br/>
Stray can be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stray/id6451498949?mt=12">downloaded from the Mac App Store</a> for &#36;30.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/stray-apple-silicon-macs/">Popular Adventure Game &#039;Stray&#039; Now Available for Apple Silicon Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/popular-adventure-game-stray-now-available-for-apple-silicon-macs.2412922/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The first version of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; came out in March 2016, which means it has been seven years since it launched.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iphone-se-2016.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925333" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; was sold until September 2018, so it has been five years since it was last available for sale, making it eligible for Apple's vintage designation. Products are marked as vintage five years after the device was last sold by Apple, while products are marked as obsolete at the seven year point.<br/>
<br/>
Vintage devices are not guaranteed to be eligible for repairs through Apple or Apple Authorized Service Providers, though Apple will offer repairs if the parts are available.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has continued on with the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; line, and today, it continues to be the only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> fingerprint sensor. There have been three generations released to date, with the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3 introduced in March 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Apple today has also marked the second-generation 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> as vintage, as well as the special edition Mickey Solo3 Wireless headphones. The Powerbeats 2 and Solo2 Wireless headphones are now considered obsolete.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-original-iphone-se-vintage/">Apple&#039;s First iPhone SE Now Considered Vintage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-iphone-se-now-considered-vintage.2412918/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 17.2 addresses a bug that was preventing some iPhones from wirelessly charging on the wireless charging pads included in some vehicles, according to Apple's release notes for the iOS 17.2 RC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">that came out today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-wireless-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1005" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-788160" /><br/>
There <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-15-gm-charging-issue/">have been multiple complaints</a> from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> owners who have had charging issues in their Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Buick vehicles. In some of these cars, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> placed on the wireless charging pad would either not charge at all or start to charge and then stop.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the complaints were from &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; owners, and came after the iOS 17.1 update. General Motors said in November that it was aware of an issue and investigating the problem.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second charging-related bug fix that Apple has implemented in recent weeks. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/">iOS 17.1.1 update</a> that came out in early November addressed an issue that caused some &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models charged in BMW vehicles to lose NFC functionality.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 is expected to see a public release next week. The update also adds the Journal app, a Translate Action button option for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, new features in Messages, Weather and Clock widgets, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">and more</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-wireless-charging-bug-fix/">iOS 17.2 Fixes Bug Preventing Wireless Charging From Working in Some Vehicles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-fixes-bug-preventing-wireless-charging-from-working-in-some-vehicles.2412907/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new firmware update for both the Lightning and USB-C versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2. The new firmware is version 6B34, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/airpods-pro-2-firmware-6b32/">6B32 firmware</a> introduced in November.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware beyond "bug fixes and other improvements," so it is unclear what's new in the update, but prior software releases have been refining functionality introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> such as Adaptive Audio.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not give customers instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">iOS 17.2</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-rc-to-developers/">watchOS 10.2</a>, Siri can access data from the Health app for health and fitness queries, according to Apple's release notes for the updates, which are currently in beta. For the Apple Watch, this functionality is limited to the Series 9 and Ultra 2, as these are the only models that support on-device Siri processing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iOS-17-Health-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906604" /><br/>
For example, Apple says users can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, ask about the progress of closing their Activity rings for the day, or ask about their blood glucose level if they have a connected monitor.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2142151/ios-17-2-watchos-10-2-siri-health-features.html"><em>Macworld</em> shared</a> examples of supported queries:<ul><li>How many steps have I taken today?</li><br/>
<li>How many steps have I taken this week?</li><br/>
<li>What's my heart rate?</li><br/>
<li>What's my blood oxygen level?</li><br/>
<li>Check my Exercise ring.</li><br/>
<li>How does my Move ring look today?</li><br/>
<li>What's my average walking heart rate?</li><br/>
<li>How many calories have I burned?</li></ul>On the Apple Watch, health data is limited to the previous week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Siri is also gaining the ability to log data in the Health app. <em>Macworld</em> shared another list with examples of supported queries:<ul><li>My weight is 195.3 pounds.</li><br/>
<li>I started spotting today.</li><br/>
<li>I've taken my 6 pm medications.</li><br/>
<li>My body temperature is 98.5 degrees.</li><br/>
<li>My period started today.</li><br/>
<li>My blood sugar is 143.</li><br/>
<li>Record my blood pressure as 118 over 76.</li></ul>This functionality must be enabled first to work. On the iPhone, open the Settings app and select Health → Data Access & Devices → Siri, and then toggle on "Access Health Data." On the Apple Watch, open the Settings app and select Health → Apps and Services → Siri, and then toggle on "Allow Siri Access to Health Data."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.2 update that Apple is set to release to the public in the near future will bring support for the next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models. Qi2 was mentioned in the release notes for the RC version of the update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">that came out today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911511" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/magsafe-blue-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
With the addition of support for the new standard, &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; models will work with Qi2 wireless chargers. Qi2 is a next-generation Qi wireless charging technology that incorporates a Magnetic Power Profile. Qi2 devices will work like accessories that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, using magnets for alignment and speedier charging. Apple added Qi2 support to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models ahead of release, so they are already compatible with the standard.<br/>
<br/>
The Magnetic Power Profile was designed based on ‌&zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;‌ contributions from Apple, and it is being combined with the new Extended Power Profile (EPP) to form what is considered "Qi2." Qi2 is meant to ensure that phones and other battery-powered mobile products are perfectly aligned with chargers for improved energy efficiency and faster charging. It will allow for new accessories that would not be chargeable wirelessly using existing flat surface-to-flat surface devices.<br/>
<br/>
While Qi2 chargers will be able to charge devices at up to 15W, it is not yet clear if Apple's iPhones will support faster wireless charging speeds with Qi2 accessories. For the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, for example, Apple's technical specifications page says that the devices still support Qi wireless charging "up to 7.5W" despite the fact that they work with Qi2.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate versions (RCs) of upcoming iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-releases-ios-17-2-beta-4/">the fourth betas of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>. The RCs represent the final version of the software that is expected to be provided to the public. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918852" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Cool.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest new feature in iOS 17.2 is the Journal app, which can be used to record daily activities and thoughts. You can write about your day to day life, but Apple also provides topic suggestions based on the music you listen to, the places you visit, and the people you see. Journal entries support pictures, voice recordings, and location information, with the app organized by entry date.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, there's a Favorites playlist that houses everything you've favorited, plus Apple added support for collaborative playlists. You can now share a playlist with multiple people, and each participant can add songs.<br/>
<br/>
Stickers can now be used to reply to iMessages when you long press on a chat bubble in the Messages app, and there's also now support for the extra-secure iMessage Contact Key Verification option. If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the Action Button supports Translate in iOS 17.2, and there are new Weather and Clock widgets. Apple's full release notes for the update are below.<blockquote>This update introduces Journal, an all-new way to reflect on life’s moments and preserve your memories.

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.2 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes, but tvOS 17.2 introduces an overhauled &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
The app now includes a sidebar that houses content from both Apple's services and streaming services that integrate with the tvOS Watch Now feature. There are dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>‌, MLS Season Pass, Sports, the Store, and the Library at the top of the sidebar, along with dedicated sections for streaming services like ABC, CBS, Comedy Central, Hulu, ESPN, Discovery, Peacock, Prime Video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
You can click into each streaming service to see content that's available specifically on that service, and there's also a new My TV section that replaces "My Channels."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-rc-to-developers/">Apple Seeds tvOS 17.2 Release Candidate to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-release-candidate-to-developers.2412888/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beeper Mini, a new app that ostensibly brings iMessage to Android devices with no need for sign-in with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> credentials, today launched <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeper.ima">on the Google Play Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/beeper-mini.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925247" /><br/>
Beeper Mini operates by identifying text message conversations from iMessage users and converting them to the recognizable blue bubbles associated with Apple's exclusive messaging service. This enables Android users to interact with iMessage features such as reactions, threads, high-quality media sharing, and group chats, without the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users noticing any difference.<br/>
<br/>
The app represents a departure from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/nothing-announces-imessage-compatibility/">previous methods</a> of accessing iMessage on non-Apple devices, which typically involved relaying messages through a Mac hosted in the cloud or signing in with an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;. Beeper Mini's approach involves direct communication with Apple's servers by registering a user's phone number with iMessage, a process that apparently required extensive reverse engineering of Apple's messaging system.<br/>
<br/>
<iframe width="477" height="848" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B19HBmw0gKU" title="iMessage for Android is Here Right Now | Beeper Mini" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
Beeper is a startup led by Eric Migicovsky that aims to consolidate various messaging services into a single platform. Since its initial launch on desktop devices in 2021, Beeper raised &#36;16 million in funding. Beeper claims that Beeper Mini does not access messages, contacts, or &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; passwords. The app's code will also be made open source, offering transparency and allowing for independent review.<br/>
<br/>
Beeper Mini is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeper.ima">now available for download</a> on the Google Play Store, with a seven-day free trial followed by a subscription fee of &#36;2 per month. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/">iMessage</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android/">Beeper Mini Brings iMessage to Android With No Need for Apple ID Sign-In</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android-with-no-need-for-apple-id-sign-in.2412881/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Twelve South says that when closed, the ButterFly is about the size of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> case. When unfolded, a small strip of vegan leather connects the magnetic fast charger for Apple Watch and MagSafe-compatible charger for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or AirPods.<br/>

You can fold the accessory into a hands-free display stand for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or tilt the Apple Watch magnetic charger up and use Nightstand Mode. The device includes a 30W USB-C power adapter and four international plug adapters. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a collection of deals that are matching - or nearly matching -  the same all-time low discounts we saw during Black Friday. This includes the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, 9th generation iPad, and M1 MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/airpods-pro-bulbs.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923440" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with Apple's AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case, these earbuds have returned to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0CHWRXH8B"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. This is a match of the best price we've ever tracked on this version of the AirPods, and right now only Amazon has the sale.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0CHWRXH8B"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Next, Amazon has the 9th generation iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Fth%3D1"><strong>&#36;249.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;329.00. During Black Friday, we saw this model go down to around &#36;230 at its lowest point, but today's deal is a solid second-best option and potentially the best deal you'll see before the holiday shopping season ends.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ipad-bulbs.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923456" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Fth%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;80 OFF</div>9th Gen iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;249.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Finally, Amazon has the M1 MacBook Air (256GB) for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;749.99</strong></a> when you clip an on-page coupon, down from &#36;999.00. Although a few years old at this point, this &#36;249 discount on the 2020 13-inch MacBook Air is a great deal for anyone who needs a simple and reliable entry-level notebook for browsing the Internet.<br/>

Across the lineup, there are also multiple prices that are matching the record low Black Friday prices we saw this year, and the first time we've seen them return since the shopping holiday ended.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple supplier BOE still can't catch a break in its production of OLED displays for iPhone 15 models. According to a new report by <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231205PD204.html">DigiTimes</a></em>, the Chinese-based manufacturer is still struggling to expand panel supply due to yield issues.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iphone-15-dynamic-island.jpg" alt="" width="2096" height="1179" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912522" /><br/>
Despite investing in panel research and development, BOE has continually struggled with yield rate problems, particularly for OLED panels for the iPhone 15 basic model. The panels were conditionally approved for mass production by Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/apple-samsung-oled-iphone-15-panels/">March 2023</a>, but in September the supplier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-oled-display-orders-dominated-by-samsung/">failed to get formal approval</a> and Apple ended up dropping the order.<br/>
<br/>
BOE was supposed to be supplying OLED displays for both the standard ‌iPhone 15‌ and larger ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, but that fell through when the manufacturer experienced problems with light leakage around the portion of the OLED display where the pill and hole cutouts secure the space necessary for the TrueDepth camera and Face ID, where the Dynamic Island is located.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-dynamic-island-iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 15: What Dynamic Island Does and How to Use It</a></li></ul><br/>
Initial speculations suggested that BOE might supply around 5 million iPhone 15 panels in 2023. However, due to delays and poor yield rates, the expected supply volume has been reduced to 2 to 3 million panels. What makes things worse for BOE is that the light leakage is harder to avoid on a larger panel. As a result, it is now considered very unlikely that BOE will get production approval for the iPhone 15 Plus panels in 2023. Its yield rate is still estimated to be around only 30%.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Samsung Display supplies panels for the entire iPhone 15 series and held a 91% market share in these kinds of panels from June to August 2023. If BOE cannot expand its supply, Samsung will reap the benefits once again.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/boe/">BOE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/iphone-15-oled-supplier-problems-persist/">iPhone 15 OLED Supplier Still Plagued by Leaky Light Issues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-oled-supplier-still-plagued-by-leaky-light-issues.2412860/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has asked the Indian government to exempt existing iPhones from new rules that require smartphones sold in the country to have a USB-C charging port, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-warns-indias-eu-style-charger-rules-will-hit-local-production-target-2023-12-05/">Reuters</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
India wants to replicate an upcoming European Union rule that requires all smartphones to implement the USB-C charging standard. However, according to a new report, Apple has told India its local production targets will be hit if the country requires all iPhones to have USB-C charging ports.<br/>
<blockquote>In a closed-door Nov. 28 meeting chaired by India's IT ministry, Apple asked officials to exempt existing iPhone models from the rules, warning it will otherwise struggle to meet production targets set under India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, according to the meeting minutes seen by <em>Reuters</em>.</blockquote>Only the newest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models currently have the USB-C port. The problem for Apple is that many consumers in India prefer to buy older models like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, which Apple produces in India for local sales and exports as part of its adherence to the country's PLI scheme.<br/>
<blockquote>"If the regulation is implemented on earlier models of mobile phones, they (Apple) will not be able to meet the PLI targets," the minutes quoted Apple's regulatory and product compliance executives as saying while opposing the rules.</blockquote>While the EU regulation comes into effect in December 2024, India has said it wants compliance by June 2025. According to the report, Apple told officials it can comply with that timeline if existing models are exempted from the rules, but will need 18 months beyond 2024 if they are not. India's IT ministry is said to have decided to review its request in light of the meeting and will reach a decision later. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/">USB-C</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-india-exempt-usb-c-charging-standard/">Apple Pushes Back Against iPhone USB-C Regulations in India</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pushes-back-against-iphone-usb-c-regulations-in-india.2412856/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An increasing number of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users are reporting a persistent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> bug that causes the app switcher to suddenly appear when they are typing on the screen. If you have experienced this frustrating issue, you are not alone. <br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255245306">Apple Community forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/17i3ty7/app_switching_while_typing/">Reddit</a> contain similar reports of people being kicked out of Messages, Notes, and other apps mid-sentence only to find themselves in another app because they were still tapping the screen when the app switcher suddenly appeared. <br/>
<br/>
You can <a href="https://share.icloud.com/photos/03dLrdmaTOPNY0bSiGlYxKpcQ">see it in action here</a>. The bug can be hard to replicate, but it seems to happen to affected users when they have been typing on the virtual keyboard at pace for a while. The bug has been reported in all versions of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; up to and including the most recent iOS 17.1.2 update, and some users have returned their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; only for it to occur on the replacement device, suggesting that Apple is not sufficiently aware of the problem. <br/>
<br/>
Until Apple deals with the issue, there is a temporary fix – or more accurately a workaround, since it involves turning off Reachability, a feature that some users will undoubtedly miss. Reachability is an optional feature that lowers the top half of the screen so it's within easy reach of your fingers. Here's how to disable it.<br/>
<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under "Physical and Motor," select <strong>Touch</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Turn off the switch next to <strong>Reachability</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/turn-off-reachability.jpg" alt="" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925198" /><br/>
<br/>
Disabling Reachability appears to stop the typing bug in its tracks for everyone affected, which suggests Apple has an unidentified sensitivity issue linked to the accessibility feature. <br/>

		<title>Instagram and Facebook Messenger Chats to Disconnect This Month</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta has revealed plans to end Instagram users' ability to chat with Facebook accounts later this month, rolling back a feature that it introduced over three years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/instagram-messenger.jpg" alt="" width="3440" height="1680" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925192" /><br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/30/facebook-unifies-messenger-and-instagram/">September 2020</a>, Meta (then Facebook) announced it was merging its Facebook Messenger service with Instagram direct messaging, allowing Instagram users to chat with Facebook users and vice versa using the same platform.<br/>
<br/>
The move was supposed to be part of a long-term plan to merge Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp chat platforms into one underlying messaging infrastructure. The idea behind the plan was said to be to keep people within the Facebook ecosystem, and off of rival texting apps like Apple's iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
However, according to an <a href="https://help.instagram.com/654906392080948">updated Instagram support page</a>, beginning in mid-December the following cross-app communication features will no longer be available to Instagram users:<br/>
<blockquote><ul><li>You won't be able to start new conversations or calls with Facebook accounts from Instagram.</li><br/>
<li>Any existing chats on Instagram that you've had with Facebook accounts will become read-only, even if these Facebook accounts are removed from the chat. This means that you and others with Instagram accounts can't send new messages in these chats.</li><br/>
<li>Facebook accounts won't be able to view your Activity Status or whether you've seen a message.</li><br/>
<li>Any existing chats you've had with Facebook accounts won't move to your inbox on Facebook or Messenger.</li></ul></blockquote>When cross-app chat ends, Instagram users will need to start a new chat on Messenger or Facebook from their Facebook account to continue conversations with Facebook accounts.<br/>
<br/>
Meta offered no reason for the change, but <em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/12/04/instagram-facebook-messenger-chats-disconnected/">9to5Google</a></em> speculates that it could be part of a larger effort to comply with Europe's Digital Markets Act (DMA). The theory is that Meta could be preparing to introduce wider interoperability between Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, which would fulfill a key requirement of the DMA. Either that or it is simply scaling back Messenger once again – the company recently removed SMS/MMS support on Android and has shut down Messenger Lite.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook-messenger/">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/instagram-messenger-chats-disconnecting/">Instagram and Facebook Messenger Chats to Disconnect This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-and-facebook-messenger-chats-to-disconnect-this-month.2412848/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
