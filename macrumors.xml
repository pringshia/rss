		<description><![CDATA[T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/offers/t-mobile-adds-hulu-to-its-streaming-suite">today announced</a> that people who subscribe to the Go5G Next plan will have free access to ad-supported Hulu content starting on January 24.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/07/hulu-logo-2019.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-701546" /><br/>
Hulu is a perk that joins the existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> and Netflix subscriptions that T-Mobile Go5G Next users have access to.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile says that free Netflix, Hulu, &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj;, and MLB.TV add up to more than &#36;35 per month or &#36;400 per year in benefits.<br/>
<br/>
The Hulu plan that T-Mobile customers are able to access is valued at &#36;7.99 per month, and it does include ads during shows and movies. Hulu says that ads typically play at the beginning of the stream and throughout the video, similar to a traditional TV broadcast.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile's Go5G Next plan is the company's highest-tier plan that includes a smartphone upgrade with trade-in on an annual basis. It is priced at &#36;100 per month for a single line.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/">Hulu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/t-mobile-free-hulu/">T-Mobile Offers Free Ad-Supported Hulu to Subscribers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-offers-free-ad-supported-hulu-to-subscribers.2415373/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Three hours after releasing the second betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, Apple has pulled the updates from the Developer Center and over the air, meaning they are no longer available to download and install.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.3-Buggy-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928685" /><br/>
Apple has removed the iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas after a number of people reported that the software is bricking devices. According to reports on <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-2-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2415339/">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonButch/status/1742628347002204350">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_inside/111693591558795389">Mastodon</a>, some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners who updated found their devices stuck in a boot loop.<br/>
<br/>
The only fix to the issue appears to be restoring a stuck device, which is why Apple has pulled the update. Once the bug is addressed, Apple will re-release the beta.<br/>
<br/>
There are reports that suggest the iOS 17.3 boot loop bug <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_inside/111693804775894724">could be related</a> to the Back Tap setting. A log shared by developer Guilherme Rambo indicates that a Back Tap setting caused his device to crash, and there have been several other affected users who have Back Tap enabled in some capacity.<br/>
<br/>
Some others who had Back Tap enabled were able to install the update, and others who did not have the feature on had the booting issue, so it is not entirely clear how Back Tap is involved.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-pulls-ios-17-3-beta-2/">Apple Pulls iOS 17.3 Beta 2 Due to Boot Loop Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pulls-ios-17-3-beta-2-due-to-boot-loop-issue.2415355/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last month, many Apple Music subscribers reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/apple-music-add-playlist-songs-to-library-bug/">"Add Playlist Songs" setting was broken</a> on the iPhone, iPad, and sometimes the Mac. After a user toggled off the setting, the bug could cause it to turn back on, resulting in any songs that a user added to a playlist being added to their music library in an unwanted manner.<br/>
<br/>

Fortunately, it appears that Apple quickly addressed the bug with a server-side fix, and users are no longer impacted by this issue. Given it was a server-side fix, users do not need to update their devices to a newer software version for it to apply.<br/>
<br/>
Apple never publicly acknowledged the bug, so the underlying cause is unclear.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-music-playlist-bug-fixed/">Apple Music Bug Related to &#039;Add Playlist Songs&#039; Setting is Now Fixed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-bug-related-to-add-playlist-songs-setting-is-now-fixed.2415354/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The second beta of iOS 17.3 that Apple released today is causing major issues for some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners, so users that have not yet installed the new software may want to hold off.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/bricked-iphone-vittici.jpg" alt="" width="1662" height="934" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928675" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Image from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_inside/111693591558795389">MacStories' Federico Vittici</a></div></em><br/>
As noted by reports on <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-2-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2415339/">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonButch/status/1742628347002204350">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_inside/111693591558795389">Mastodon</a>, some &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; owners who have attempted to update to iOS 17.3 beta 2 have found their devices stuck in a boot loop with a blank black screen that has a frozen spinning wheel.<br/>
<br/>
Restoring to the prior version of iOS 17.3 or the iOS 17.2.1 release software appears to address the problem, but users who do not have a backup may have issues with the restore process.<br/>
<br/>
Not all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users appear to be affected, as some iPhones updated to iOS 17.3 beta 2 have come through fine.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet commented on the bug, but it is likely the second iOS 17.3 beta will be pulled in the near future until the issue can be addressed.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/ios-17-3-beta-2-bricking-some-iphones/">Warning: iOS 17.3 Beta 2 Bricking Some iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/warning-ios-17-3-beta-2-bricking-some-iphones.2415350/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is discounting an array of Apple Watches today, including the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Although none are at all-time low prices, these are the best discounts we've tracked since the Black Friday shopping season.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-and-Ultra-2-Deals-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913210" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Series 9</h2><br/>
Starting with the Apple Watch Series 9, Amazon has the 41mm GPS device for &#36;349.00 in three Aluminum colors, down from &#36;399.00. The 45mm GPS device is on sale for &#36;379.00 in every Aluminum color, down from &#36;429.00.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 9 is Apple's newest mainline wearable device. It shares the same look as the previous generation model, but includes a faster S9 chip, brighter display, and new features like Double Tap.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5R8BP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm GPS) for &#36;349.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXF9R4Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm GPS) for &#36;379.00</div></a></div><h2>Apple Watch SE</h2><br/>
Amazon has the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE for &#36;199.00, down from &#36;249.00, and the 44mm GPS Apple Watch SE for &#36;229.00, down from &#36;279.00. Both models are available in three Aluminum colors: Midnight, Silver, and Starlight.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch SE is Apple's low-cost option in the Apple Watch lineup, and it'll get the job done for most people who want a simple fitness tracker. It lacks the Series 9's health sensors like ECG, blood oxygen, and temperature sensing.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXCXKPD%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch SE (40mm GPS) for &#36;199.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5W8YM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch SE (44mm GPS) for &#36;229.00</div></a></div><h2>Apple Watch Ultra 2</h2><br/>
Finally, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 has dropped to &#36;749.00 on Amazon, down from &#36;799.00. This one is available in a large collection of colors and band styles, and it's just about &#36;10 away from the all-time low price.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is Apple's most rugged wearable, and compared to the previous generation it has an improved GPS, more durable display, extra long battery life, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7C4CL%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;749.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3 introduces a Stolen Device Protection feature that limits access to your private information in case someone obtains both your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and your passcode. When activated, it requires <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> identity verification to do things like accessing passwords in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain, turning off Lost Mode, making purchases through Safari with saved payment credentials, and more.<br/>
<br/>
There are also features that require verification <em>and</em> have a one-hour delay to access, such as changing an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; passcode, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; passcode, turning off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and turning off &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;. More details can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">found in our article on Stolen Device Protection</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>, a feature that lets <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> subscribers share playlists with others to build shared song lists. Collaborative playlists are simple to use, can be shared with a link, and support emoji reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release iOS 17.3 later in January.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-betas-of-ios-17-3-and-ipados-17-3-to-developers.2415337/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Once beta updates have been activated, watchOS 10.3 can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.3 update to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming two weeks after the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-seds-tvos-17-3-beta-1-to-developers/">first tvOS 17.3 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.3 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-seeds-tvos-17-3-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of tvOS 17.3 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-tvos-17-3-to-developers.2415336/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the majority of Apple's product lineup has been updated over the past few years, there are a handful of devices and accessories that are quite old. Below, we highlight seven of the oldest and most obscure products that Apple still sells in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-and-Often-Forgotten-Products-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928623" /><br/>
Many of these products are unlikely to be updated ever again, and it's unclear how long Apple will continue to sell them on its online store.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>SuperDrive</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-SuperDrives.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928630" /><br/>
Introduced alongside the original MacBook Air in 2008, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive">USB SuperDrive</a> is an external CD/DVD drive. It remains available on Apple's online store for &#36;79, but you'll need a USB-A to USB-C adapter to use it with a modern MacBook.<br/>
<br/>
The last MacBook with a built-in CD/DVD drive was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/27/apple-discontinues-non-retina-macbook-pro/">discontinued in 2016</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MagSafe Converter</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-MagSafe-Adapters.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928628" /><br/>
For just &#36;9.99, you can own Apple's tiny <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD504LL/A/magsafe-to-magsafe-2-converter">MagSafe to MagSafe 2 converter</a>. This adapter allows Apple's very-old Thunderbolt Display to charge an also-very-old MacBook Pro or MacBook Air equipped with a MagSafe 2 connector.<br/>
<br/>
For those counting, Apple moved on to MagSafe 3 in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>EarPods With 3.5mm Plug</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-EarPods-With-3.5mm-Plugs.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928624" /><br/>
Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone starting with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus back in 2016, but it continues to sell wired <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-35mm-headphone-plug">EarPods with a 3.5mm headphone plug</a> for &#36;19. You can also get EarPods <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/earpods-usb-c-lightning-or-headphone-plug/">with Lightning or USB-C</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Macs still have a headphone jack.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>30-Pin to USB Cable</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-30-Pin-Connectors.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928622" /><br/>
Still rocking out with an older iPod or iPhone? Apple has you covered with its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA591G/C/apple-30-pin-to-usb-cable">30-pin to USB cable</a>, featuring breakthrough USB 2.0 technology from the early 2000s.<br/>
<br/>
Pro tip: you can get one for much cheaper on Amazon if you really need one.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Pro Security Lock Adapter</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-Mac-Pro-Security-Lock-Adapters.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928626" /><br/>
Want to keep your 2013 Mac Pro secure in 2024? Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MF858AM/A/mac-pro-security-lock-adapter">&#36;49 adapter</a> lets you attach a compatible Kensington lock to the computer.<br/>
<br/>
We're honestly surprised Apple still sells this one.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Link Bracelet</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-Link-Bracelets.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928625" /><br/>
Apple hasn't updated the stainless steel <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU9A3AM/A/42mm-silver-link-bracelet">Link Bracelet</a> since the original Apple Watch was released in 2015. The band is still listed in its original 38mm and 42mm sizes for &#36;449.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Pro Wheels</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-Mac-Pro-Wheels-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928677" /><br/>
For the low price of &#36;699, you can <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX572ZM/A/apple-mac-pro-wheels-kit">add wheels</a> to your 2019 or newer Mac Pro tower, allowing it to roll around. Or, you could <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvAX1vQJnAU">install them on a skateboard</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXNM2ZM/A/apple-mac-pro-feet-kit">Mac Pro feet kit</a> for &#36;299 in this economy.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/old-apple-products-list/">Apple Still Selling These Old and Often Forgotten Products in 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-selling-these-old-and-often-forgotten-products-in-2024.2415329/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is kicking off the new year with an all-time low price on Apple's AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. There's an estimated delivery date of January 7 for most residences in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/AirPods-Pro-Case-With-USB-C.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909509" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
We haven't tracked an all-time low price on this model of the AirPods Pro 2 since around early December. This is largely the same model as the AirPods Pro 2 from 2022, with the addition of a USB-C port on the MagSafe Charging Case, instead of Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
A few other noteworthy AirPods deals include the AirPods 3 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;149.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;169.00, and the AirPods 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;99.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00. Stock on the AirPods 3 has begun to dwindle with delivery into mid January, but the AirPods 2 has the same estimates as the AirPods Pro 2.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Vision Pro headset will launch in the last week of January, a sketchy online report coming out of China claims.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-WWCD23-Vision-Pro-EyeSight-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-922614" /><br/>
The information comes from <a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/livenews/2603883"><em>Wall Street Insights</em></a>, a Chinese investor news service with an unproven track record for Apple rumors. The website claims to have obtained exclusive information suggesting that the Vision Pro will launch on Saturday, January 27 in the United States. While the report clearly says that the launch is set to occur on a date that falls on a Saturday in the United States, there is a chance that the website is actually referring to January 27 in China, which falls on Friday, January 26 in the United States – a much more likely date for the launch of the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has rarely launched any of its hardware products on Saturdays, so it seems very unlikely that the Vision Pro headset would be the first. The company likely prefers to launch products on weekdays to align with normal business hours, ensuring maximum media coverage and stock market reaction. Friday, January 26 is likely also a more accurate interpretation since Apple overwhelmingly chooses Fridays to launch its new devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple simply says that the Vision Pro headset will launch "early" this year and has not yet announced any specific time frame for pre-orders and the product's launch. Oft-accurate Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/25/vision-pro-mass-shipments-timing-kuo/">recently said</a> that he expects the Vision Pro to hit shelves in late January or early February, which effectively lines up with this latest report from China. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, on the other hand, has been firmer in saying that Apple is planning the device's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/vision-pro-february-launch/">retail launch for February</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/02/vision-pro-could-launch-in-last-week-of-january/">Sketchy Rumor Says Vision Pro Will Launch in Final Week of January</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sketchy-rumor-says-vision-pro-will-launch-in-final-week-of-january.2415237/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
While we know what we're expecting to see from Apple in 2024, we want to hear from the <em>MacRumors</em> community. What are you hoping to see Apple release this year?<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[2024 is shaping up to be a busy year for Apple with a large number of important new releases due across the company's product lines, but there are some noticeable absences from its rumored plans. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Logo-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924188" /><br/>
Using information from various analysts and reliable sources, here's everything we're no longer expecting Apple to release this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>iPhone SE 4</h3><br/>
While Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/06/iphone-se-4-canceled-kuo/">previously rumored</a> to be planning the launch of the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> for 2024, the company is now widely expected to release the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-se-5g-modem-2025-launch-rumor/">in 2025</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
The current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; launched in March 2022, meaning that it will be at least 33 months old by the time its successor arrives. The next-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is expected to feature a design <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-se-4-iphone-14-chassis/">based on the iPhone 14</a>, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/suppliers-bidding-on-iphone-se-4-displays/">OLED display</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-se-4-reuse-iphone-14-battery/">larger battery</a>, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/iphone-se-4-to-feature-action-button-and-more/">Action Button, USB-C port, Face ID</a>, and potentially Apple's first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/kuo-iphone-se-4-oled-display/">custom 5G cellular modem</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>AirTag 2</h3><br/>
Production of the second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> tracker was apparently due to kick off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/">in the fourth quarter of 2024</a>, but the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/airtag-2-postponed-until-2025/">latest forecast</a> from Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> claims that the accessory will not reach mass production and be released until 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/AirTag-2-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917578" /><br/>
According to Kuo, the second-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; will be part of a new spatial computing ecosystem that Apple is building, with the Vision Pro serving as the core to integrate other devices. A new &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; would likely incorporate Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, allowing for even more precise tracking at longer distances.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>MicroLED Apple Watch Ultra</h3><br/>
The first Apple device to offer a microLED display will apparently be an upcoming Apple Watch Ultra model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/microled-apple-watch-still-on-track-for-2025/">released in late 2025</a> or 2026. In fact, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/kuo-apple-watch-ultra-3-in-2024-odds-decreasing/">may not update</a> the Apple Watch Ultra in 2024 and hold off for the significant display upgrade the following year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Black-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905396" /><br/>
Apple's plan to bring a microLED display to the Apple Watch Ultra is very widely corroborated, starting with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/">report</a> from display analyst Ross Young in January 2023. The microLED display is expected to be 2.12-inches in size, a 10% increase over the display of the current Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
The advanced display technology offers improved brightness, color reproduction, dynamic range, viewing angles, and efficiency, making images look more like they are "painted" atop the display glass. The project is part of Apple's plan to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/">reduce its reliance on Samsung</a> as a supplier while yielding benefits from engineering its own displays in-house, just like its chip technology.<br/>
<br/>
While <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/cheaper-airpods-and-micro-led-apple-watch-rumors/">initial reports</a> distinctively placed the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a> Ultra in 2024, the latest reports point to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/">late 2025</a> or potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/apple-watch-ultra-with-microled-to-launch-in-2026/">even 2026</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>iMac Pro</h3><br/>
Apple is still rumored to be working on a high-end "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> Pro" model with a 32-inch mini-LED display and a larger <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/imac-pro-2022-rumors/">selection of ports</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
Despite the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/imac-pro-officially-discontinued/">discontinuation of the iMac Pro</a> and any &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; models larger than 24-inches in 2021, Apple is still said to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/imac-with-over-30-inch-display/">plans to launch</a> a substantially bigger and more powerful &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; model.<br/>
<br/>
While <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">floated the possibility</a> of the machine launching in late 2024, 2025 may be a more likely time frame.   &zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj; has similarly said that the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">launch in 2025</a>, so the 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; may well continue to be the only Apple all-in-one desktop available this year. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Foldable iPhone and iPad</h3><br/>
Apple has been known to be working on foldable display technology for many years, filing multiple patents related to the technology, but a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> still seems to be quite some time away.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="820" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-797663" /><br/>
Rumors in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/">September 2020</a> indicated that Samsung was providing foldable display samples to Apple for a future foldable ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌, but there had been no strong indication that Apple was planning to use Samsung's technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-foldable-panels-samsung-display/">until recently</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021, <em>Bloomberg</em> claimed that Apple had started "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor/">early work</a>" on an ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ with a foldable display, but that it had not committed to releasing a foldable device at that time. Development in 2021 had not expanded beyond a display, and Apple did not have full foldable ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ prototypes. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj; initially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphones-with-under-screen-touch-id-now-coming-in-2023-foldable-iphone-in-2024/">said</a> that Apple would introduce a foldable ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ in 2024, but in 2022, he revised his prediction and said that Apple is unlikely to unveil a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; until <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/apple-testing-9-inch-foldable/">2025 or later</a>. Display analyst Ross Young has also suggested <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/21/apple-exploring-20-inch-foldable-macbook/">2025</a> is the earliest that we might see a foldable ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to bring a foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to market before a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but for the time being, the company is said to be focused on expanding OLED displays throughout the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Mac lineups and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/apple-focusing-on-oled-rather-than-foldable-ipad/">considering the potential</a> of offering a foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; even further in the future.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/01/apple-products-were-not-expecting-to-launch-in-2024/">Apple Products We&#039;re NOT Expecting to Launch in 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-products-were-not-expecting-to-launch-in-2024.2415157/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has broken a tradition it maintained for 12 years, releasing no new iPads in 2023 – the first time that the company has chosen to not launch a new tablet in an entire calendar year since the introduction of the product line.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/aapl-logo-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="890" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-776656" /><br/>
From its debut in 2010, the iPad has been an important product for Apple and the clear tablet market leader, releasing at least one new model every year. In recent times, the company has released as many as four new iPad models per year. Before 2023, 2009 was the last year with no new iPads, simply because the product line had not yet launched. <br/>
<br/>
The most recent iPad launches took place in October 2022. The only iPad-adjacent hardware released in 2023 was the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">Apple Pencil with USB-C</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li><strong>2010</strong>: iPad (1st generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2011</strong>: iPad 2</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2012</strong>: iPad (3rd generation), iPad (4th generation), and iPad mini (1st generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2013</strong>: iPad Air (1st generation) and iPad mini 2</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2014</strong>: iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2015</strong>: iPad mini 4 and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2016</strong>: iPad Pro 9.7-inch</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2017</strong>: iPad (5th generation), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation), and iPad Pro 10.5-inch</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2018</strong>: iPad (6th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2019</strong>: iPad (7th generation), iPad Air (3rd generation), and iPad mini (5th generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2020</strong>: iPad (8th generation), iPad Air (4th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (2nd generation), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (4th generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2021</strong>: iPad (9th generation), iPad mini (6th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2022</strong>: iPad (10th generation), iPad Air (5th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (4th generation), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation)</li><br/>
    <li><strong>2023</strong>: <em>None</em></li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
This hiatus in new iPad releases is noteworthy considering the history of the product line and could signal a moment of reflection about the direction of the device. As the iPad has become more advanced and widely adopted, the urgency for frequent upgrades has diminished for many potential customers. This shift in consumer behavior could have prompted Apple to reevaluate its tablet strategy, focusing on more impactful and less frequent hardware updates.<br/>
<br/>
Another aspect to consider is the criticism Apple has faced regarding the increasing complexity of the iPad lineup and questions around the direction of iPadOS. By taking a year off from new releases, Apple may be planning to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/what-the-2024-ipad-lineup-could-look-like/">reshape the lineup</a> with a clearer sense of purpose going forward.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors and analyst forecasts suggest that 2024 will be a much more significant year for the iPad lineup, with every model, encompassing the entry-level iPad, iPad mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, expected to receive a hardware refresh. With the rumored introduction of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">12.9-inch iPad Air</a> model, 2024 could see Apple launch an unprecedented six iPad models in a single calendar year. The flagship iPad Pro is expected to introduce at least <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/2024-ipad-pro-what-to-expect/">a dozen new features</a>, including OLED display technology, the M3 chip, and a new, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">"laptop-like" keyboard accessory</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/01/apple-just-broke-a-tradition-it-held-for-12-years/">Apple Just Broke a Tradition It Held for 12 Years</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-just-broke-a-tradition-it-held-for-12-years.2415136/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[2023 is quickly drawing to close, so it's a traditional time for us to look back at everything that happened in the Apple world over the past year and look forward to what we're expecting to see in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/top-stories-30dec2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928492" /><br/>
While the news and rumor cycle largely slows down at this time of year, the past couple of weeks have been dominated by developments in a patent dispute that saw Apple forced to briefly halt U.S. sales of the latest Apple Watch models before a court paused the ban. Make sure to read on below for the latest developments in this case and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 Once Again Available to Purchase From Apple's Online Store</h2><br/>
Last week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-pausing-series-9-ultra-2-sales-in-us/">paused sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the U.S.</a> due to a patent dispute with medical tech company Masimo related to blood oxygen sensing.<br/>
<br/>

In January, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/apple-watch-masimo-patent-infringement/">infringed on a Masimo patent</a> related to blood oxygen sensing, and it ordered an import and sales ban for Apple Watch models offering the feature. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/26/apple-watch-import-ban-official/">Apple appealed the decision</a> in court and was granted a temporary stay, so the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused/">ban is lifted</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-online/">sales have resumed</a> for now.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>New iOS Features Coming in 2024 for Messages, Apple Music, and More</h2><br/>
2024 is just a few days away, and there are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/new-ios-features-launching-in-2024/">many iOS 17 and iOS 18 features</a> that are expected to launch throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912514" /><br/>

<br/>
<h2>Kuo: Vision Pro Likely to Launch by Early February</h2><br/>
Apple will likely <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/25/vision-pro-mass-shipments-timing-kuo/">begin selling the Vision Pro in the U.S. in late January or early February</a>, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" /><br/>
Apple first announced the Vision Pro at WWDC in June, and said it would launch in the U.S. in early 2024, followed by more countries later in the year. Kuo estimates that Vision Pro shipments in 2024 will reach approximately 500,000 units, which would make it a low-volume product.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has not significantly tweaked <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> screen sizes since the introduction of the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 12 models in 2020, but that's set to change with the 2024 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models will have notably larger display sizes than the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models. Here's what we know.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-16-preliminary-weights-dimensions/">multiple sources</a>, the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;‌ and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max will feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/">increase in display size</a> compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max, measuring roughly 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches, respectively. To be more precise, the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;‌ will have a 6.27-inch display (159.31 mm), while the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max will feature a 6.85-inch (174.06 mm) screen.<br/>

With the increase in display size, the dimensions of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s body will also increase. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;‌ and 16 Pro Max will be slightly taller than their predecessors, while also being somewhat wider. <br/>
<br/>
The larger form factor of the devices will give Apple more internal space for components. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models could get larger, longer-lasting batteries for example. The display itself could see improvements, too (see below). Besides that, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/01/iphone-16-series-16-rumored-new-features/">plenty of additional features are rumored</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Display Technology</h2><br/>
Apple is weighing up the use of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/iphone-16-oled-displays-micro-lens-efficiency/">micro-lens technology</a> to maintain or increase the brightness of OLED displays on next year's &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models while potentially reducing their power consumption. Micro-lens arrays or MLA uses a uniform pattern of billions of lenses inside the panel to reduce internal reflection. The reflected light increases perceived brightness without increasing power consumption.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/iPhone-14-Pro-Display-Two-Times-Brighter-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2504" height="1408" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862901" /><br/>
Next year's &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; could feature a more power-efficient display thanks to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/iphone-16-more-efficient-oled-display/">new OLED material set</a> that is reportedly being developed by Samsung specifically for Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</h2><br/>
We are not expecting size changes for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, and these devices will be the same size as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. However, with the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 17 and ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 17 Plus in 2025, Apple is expected to also bring the larger 6.27- and 6.86-inch display sizes to its two standard ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ models. As a result, expect the entire &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 lineup to use a taller aspect ratio of 19.6:9. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Sizes: A Brief History</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li><strong>The Original iPhone to iPhone 4S (2007-2011):</strong> The first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, launched in 2007, featured a 3.5-inch screen, a size that Apple maintained up to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S. This screen size was considered quite large at the time compared to many contemporary phones.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>iPhone 5 to iPhone 5S/SE (2012-2016):</strong> With the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5, Apple increased the screen size to 4 inches. This change addressed the growing consumer trend towards larger screens, allowing for an improved viewing experience while maintaining a comfortable grip.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (2014):</strong> A significant change came with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 and 6 Plus, featuring screen sizes of 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches respectively. This move was a response to the burgeoning market of larger smartphones or "phablets." It marked Apple's foray into a segment that competitors like Samsung had been capitalizing on.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>iPhone 6S to iPhone 8 (2015-2017):</strong> The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6S, 7, and 8 series continued with the same size variants as their predecessors, 4.7 inches for the regular models and 5.5 inches for the Plus models.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>iPhone X and Beyond (2017-present):</strong> With the introduction of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X in 2017, Apple shifted to a new design paradigm, reducing bezels and introducing notch-based displays. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X had a 5.8-inch screen, which was a middle ground between the two previous sizes. Subsequent models expanded on this concept, with screen sizes increasing further in variants like the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11-pro/">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>, and later models.</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 12 mini & iPhone 13 mini (2020-2021):</strong> The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a> was introduced in 2020, and marked the first time since the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> that Apple released a new model specifically designed to be smaller and more compact. Featuring a 5.4-inch screen, it catered to users who preferred smaller, more manageable phones that could be easily used with one hand. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> mini continued the trend, however reports and market analysis indicated that the overall demand for such a device was relatively low compared to Apple's larger models, and Apple has not replicated the option in &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineups since. </li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[2024 is going to start off strong with the launch of the Vision Pro, Apple's first major new product since the 2015 Apple Watch, and new iPads, Macs, AirPods, and iPhones are set to follow.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OVkawPHKLdw" title="Apple&#39;s New Products for 2024: Vision Pro, OLED iPad Pro, iPhone 16 &amp; More!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
There are some exciting products in the works, including a larger version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a>, updated iPhones, an Apple Watch with new health features, and more. In this guide, we've outlined everything that we know about the new products that are coming from Apple in 2024, based on current rumors.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_vision_pro_february_2024">Apple Vision Pro (February 2024)</h2><br/>
Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">the Vision Pro headset</a> at WWDC in June 2023, but it's finally almost ready to launch. Apple introduced the Vision Pro early to give developers time to create apps for the device, and since then, Apple has been working on finalizing the hardware and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> operating system. The most recent rumors have suggested Apple will debut the Vision Pro in February.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Vision-Pro-Person.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913199" /><br/>
At launch, the Vision Pro is only going to be available in the United States, and it sounds like Apple may require customers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-to-push-vision-pro-customers-to-pick-up/">to purchase in store</a> or pick up online orders in a store in order for Apple employees to provide the right Light Seal and knitted headband for a good fit, plus Zeiss prescription lens inserts for those who need them.<br/>
<br/>
The headset is similar to other virtual reality headsets like the Oculus, though it is made from glass and aluminum for a premium feel. Some early testers have said that the headset can be heavy on the head, but Apple may introduce an extra strap to mitigate some of the weight. The Vision Pro is using two 4K micro-OLED displays, and the technology is both more advanced and more expensive than the displays used by Apple's competitors.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is not expecting to sell many Vision Pro headsets, and rumors suggest it'll manufacture around 400,000 units. At a &#36;3,500 price point, it's not too surprising that interest may be limited.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is a mixed reality device that transitions between virtual and augmented reality using a Digital Crown on the side. Content can be displayed in a full virtual environment, or in the real world around you using the augmented reality capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
There are more than a dozen cameras in the Vision Pro headset, and it's controlled using subtle hand gestures and eye movements. Audio Straps provide spatial audio, and there's a somewhat weird external display that projects an image of your eyes so people can tell whether you're using the headset in VR or AR mode.<br/>
<br/>
While the headset isn't particularly affordable for most people, it's an exciting launch because it's using cutting-edge technology and it is an entirely new device that's going to evolve and become sleeker and more affordable over the next decade. The Vision Pro has been likened to the Apple Watch, which was also expensive and clunky when it launched, but Apple made updates at a rapid pace and by the third generation, it was much improved.<br/>
<br/>
Much more information about the Vision Pro <strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">can be found in our Vision Pro roundup</a></strong>, and we also have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">details on visionOS in that roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="oled_ipad_pro_march_2024">OLED iPad Pro (March 2024)</h2><br/>
Apple didn't update the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup in 2023, but 2024 will be the year of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models are set to get upgraded OLED displays for the first time, so &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; screens will be as impressive as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> screens.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/OLED-iPad-Air.jpg" alt="" width="2363" height="1329" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-806474" /><br/>
This will be the first time that Apple has used OLED for such a large display, and OLED technology will bring deeper blacks, faster refresh rates, better contrast, and improved efficiency for less battery drain.<br/>
<br/>
OLED displays are thinner, so Apple may be planning to cut down on the thickness of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. A design update is expected to accompany the OLED transition, and the new iPads will come in 11.1-inch and 13-inch sizes, up from the current 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes. The size increase may come from a change in bezel width, so physical size could remain roughly the same.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will adopt the faster M3 chip that was first introduced in the MacBook Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>. Built on a 3-nanometer process, the M3 offers up to 21 percent faster CPU speeds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/how-much-better-really-is-m3/">compared to the M2</a>, and 15 percent faster GPU speeds. The GPU is also using a new architecture that optimizes memory allocation and utilization for improved performance and efficiency, plus it includes hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading.<br/>
<br/>
GPU improvements will result in better gaming graphics and capabilities, plus the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will be more efficient at tasks like video editing.<br/>
<br/>
Other possible features include up to 4TB of storage, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charging capabilities, and a higher price tag due to the OLED display technology. More on what we are expecting from the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; can be found in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/"><strong>our dedicated OLED iPad Pro guide</strong></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="two_ipad_air_models_march_2024">Two iPad Air Models (March 2024)</h2><br/>
To offer consumers more choice at a variety of price points, Apple is expanding the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; lineup in 2024. For the first time, there will be two &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models, just like there are two &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Sizes will be similar to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, coming in at 10.9 inches and 12.9 inches. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models won't have OLED displays, ProMotion, or other high-end &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; features, but they will be cheaper than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
Since Apple updated the design of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; in 2021, we're not expecting a major overhaul to the look of the device, but it's possible there will be some refinements to accommodate the new screen size.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ios_18_june_2024">iOS 18 (June 2024)</h2><br/>
Apple introduces new software updates on an annual basis at its Worldwide Developers Conference, and this year, we're expecting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; should be one of the most interesting updates we've had in years because rumors so far suggest that we're going to see Apple getting into generative AI in a big way.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" /><br/>
AI and machine learning will be used in multiple ways in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, with a range of new AI integrations in apps. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, for example, we might see auto-generated playlists, and in apps like Pages and Keynote, we may see AI-assisted writing and slide deck creation.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is expected to get features powered by large language models (LLMs), which are the driving force behind chatbots like chatGPT. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will include deeper integration with the Shortcuts app for automating complex tasks, and there will be improved interactions between &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Messages, &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will see Apple adopting Rich Communication Services (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>) as an alternative to SMS/MMS. &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; will be used for conversations between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users and Android users, and it will improve cross-platform messaging.<br/>
<br/>
Higher-resolution photos and videos will be supported, as will audio messages, cross-platform emoji reactions, read receipts, real-time typing indicators, and more. Basically, texting with someone on Android will feel a lot more like chatting with another &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user.<br/>
<br/>
Blue and green bubbles aren't going away, though. iMessage to iMessage chats will be blue, and Android to iMessage chats will still be green.<br/>
<br/>
More information on what to expect from the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/"><strong>can be found in our iOS 18 roundup</strong></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="macos_15_watchos_11_and_tvos_18">macOS 15, watchOS 11, and tvOS 18</h3><br/>
Along with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, we'll also get new versions of macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. We haven't heard much about these updates, but we can expect some of the same AI improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="visionos_2">visionOS 2</h3><br/>
Alongside the Vision Pro headset, Apple will introduce &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj;, the operating system that's designed to run on the device. It has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, a dedicated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, virtual reality environments, and Apple apps tailored to the Vision Pro Display. While the first iteration of &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; will come out alongside the headset, &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 2 will likely be previewed in June. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/visionos-home-screen-mt-hood.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900011" /><br/>
<h2 id="apple_tv_first_half_of_2024">Apple TV (First Half of 2024)</h2><br/>
Apple is working on a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K, but it is not yet clear when it's going to launch. Rumored features include a faster A16 processor and support for Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7.<br/>
<br/>
More on the next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-apple-tv/"><strong>found in our Apple TV guide</strong></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="iphone_16_september_2024">iPhone 16 (September 2024)</h2><br/>
The standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models are expected to look similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models with no size or design changes, but there will be some notable improvements. Apple is planning for a vertical camera arrangement to support spatial video capture, doing away with the diagonal lens setup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-With-Dynamic-Island.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912423" /><br/>
Right now, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models are the only devices able to record spatial video that can be viewed on the Vision Pro, but that is expected to change in 2024. There's also going to be a new Capture Button on all four &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, with the button situated on the right side of the device under the power button.<br/>
<br/>
It'll be in roughly the same spot as the mmWave antenna on U.S. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, with the mmWave antenna set to move to the left side. As the name suggests, the Capture Button will provide users with a quick way to take videos. The Capture Button will be capacitive, offering haptic feedback when pressed, plus rumors suggest it supports multiple pressure levels.<br/>
<br/>
The Action Button introduced with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; is expected to expand to the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, so it will be available across the 2024 lineup. The Action Button can be assigned to do things like mute/unmute, activate translate, turn on the flashlight, set a Focus mode, activate a custom Shortcut, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The Action Button on the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models could be upgraded to use capacitive technology, which would provide haptic feedback when pressed.<br/>
<br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup, Apple limited the 3-nanometer A17 Pro to the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, but in 2024, all four &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models will get 3-nanometer A-series chips. A new thermal design to combat overheating is a possibility as well.<br/>
<br/>
We have more on all of the features rumored for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/"><strong>in our iPhone 16 roundup</strong></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="iphone_16_pro_september_2024">iPhone 16 Pro (September 2024)</h2><br/>
Apple's flagship lineup consists of four phones, two standard models and two Pro models. This year, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models are going to get a size update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Pro-Mock-Header-Updated.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924442" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to have a 6.3-inch display, up from 6.1 inches, while the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is expected to have a 6.9-inch display, up from 6.7 inches. To accommodate the larger displays, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max will be slightly taller and wider than the equivalent &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
All of the features coming to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup are expected for the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models, including the capacitive Capture Button on the right side and an updated capacitive Action Button, both of which will feature haptic feedback.<br/>
<br/>
A faster A-series chip is rumored, likely the A18 Pro, and there are some pretty major camera updates planned. Apple may add a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, which will join the 48-megapixel Wide lens. The Ultra Wide camera will offer better low-light performance, and it will facilitate better spatial videos for the Vision Pro headset too.<br/>
<br/>
Both the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will get the 5x tetraprism lens that was limited to the 15 Pro Max in 2023, and there's one rumor about an even better periscope camera with "super zoom" capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Faster 5G modem chips from Qualcomm are expected, and the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models may also get the next-generation Wi-Fi 7 technology that offers up to 2.4x faster speeds than Wi-Fi 6.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_watch_x_september_2024">Apple Watch X (September 2024)</h2><br/>
Apple is planning a major update for the Apple Watch this year, perhaps in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the device. The Apple Watch was announced in 2014, but didn't come out until 2015, so technically it's not clear whether the anniversary will fall in 2024 or 2025. 2024 will, however, be the year that we're expected to get the "Apple Watch 10" or "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">Apple Watch X</a>" as rumors have called it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-ultra-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913279" /><br/>
Rumors suggest there will be a new design and new health features for the 2024 Apple Watch. The next Apple Watch could be slimmer, and Apple may implement a magnetic band attachment system, changing how bands connect to the Apple Watch for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
The new band system would mean that current bands would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/your-apple-watch-bands-may-not-work-with-new-model/">not likely be compatible</a> with the new version of the Apple Watch, but swapping over to a magnetic system would free up space in the Apple Watch either to make the casing slimmer or to add bigger batteries or other new internal components.<br/>
<br/>
Apple hasn't added new health features to the watch for some time, but in 2024, we could see sleep apnea detection and blood pressure monitoring. Rumors suggest the Apple Watch will be able to detect hypertension, monitoring whether a user's blood pressure is trending upward. The first iteration of blood pressure monitoring won't give specific systolic and diastolic readings, but a future version might.<br/>
<br/>
Sleep apnea detection will be done through sleep measurements and the tracking of breathing patterns. The Apple Watch will be able to inform users if the condition might be present, allowing them to contact their doctor for more information.<br/>
<br/>
More on changes expected for the 2024 Apple Watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">can be found in our Apple Watch X guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="airpods_4_september_2024">AirPods 4 (September 2024)</h2><br/>
Fourth-generation AirPods are coming in 2024, and as with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, Apple is going for a two-model launch. Two versions of the AirPods will be available at different price points, with the higher-end version to gain Active Noise Cancellation, a feature that has previously been limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/airpodsd-3-purple-4.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-855069" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a> will have an updated design that's a cross between the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a> and the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, with shorter stems. Fit is expected to be improved, as is sound quality, but it is unclear if Apple will add silicone tips.<br/>
<br/>
A redesigned case is set to feature speakers for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> alerts and a USB-C charging port, and with a software update coming later in 2024, Apple will add hearing aid functionality that will let the AirPods serve as an over-the-counter alternative to traditional hearing aids.<br/>
<br/>
New &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; are in the works too, but a refresh isn't expected until 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="usb-c_airpods_max_september_2024">USB-C AirPods Max (September 2024)</h2><br/>
Apple hasn't updated the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; since launch, and in 2024, they'll get a minor refresh. Apple is expected to add a USB-C port for charging and new color options, but nothing else will change.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/airpods-max-cyber.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875245" /><br/>
<h2 id="ipad_mini_7_october_2024">iPad Mini 7 (October 2024)</h2><br/>
There's a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> coming, but no design changes are planned. We can expect an upgraded A-series chip, likely the A16, along with upgraded front and rear cameras.<br/>
<br/>
The display assembly may be installed in a different way in order to minimize "jelly scrolling" or screen tearing, which can cause images and text on one side of the display to be tilted downward due to mismatched refresh rates.<br/>
<br/>
New colors are likely, and Apple will probably add Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, improvements it has been making to all of its &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="refreshed_low-cost_ipad_october_2024">Refreshed Low-Cost iPad (October 2024)</h2><br/>
Alongside the new &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; 7, we could see a refreshed low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. Apple typically updates the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; on an annual basis, but the company skipped 2023, so we're due for a refresh.<br/>
<br/>
No design changes are coming, but the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will get a faster chip (likely the A16), and it could be updated with support for Wi-Fi 6E.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="mac_mini_late_2024">Mac mini (Late 2024)</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> is due for an update, as it was last refreshed with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chips in January 2023. A 2024 version of the desktop machine will include Apple's M3 and M3 Pro chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/mac-mini-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909563" /><br/>
<h2 id="accessories">Accessories</h2><br/>
<h3 id="magic_keyboard">Magic Keyboard</h3><br/>
Alongside the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, Apple is expected to debut an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/magic-keyboard-apple-pencil-rumors/">updated version of the Magic Keyboard</a>. The new Magic Keyboard will feature a sturdier frame made from aluminum, giving it a more Mac-like look.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/2021-Magic-Keyboard-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2226" height="1252" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-797122" /><br/>
The keyboard will be made of aluminum as well, and Apple is planning to add a larger trackpad that more closely resembles the trackpad of the MacBook.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="apple_pencil_3">Apple Pencil 3</h3><br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/magic-keyboard-apple-pencil-rumors/">refreshed version of the Apple Pencil</a> is in the works, with the new device set to be a followup to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> 2. It will be a higher-end &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; able to work with Apple's next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/apple-pencil-memorial-day.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897359" /><br/>
We don't yet know a lot about what we can expect from a new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_possibilities">Other Possibilities</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>MacBook Pro</strong> - The MacBook Pro was updated with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips in late 2023. Apple sometimes refreshes the MacBook Pro annually, but so far there's no word of M4 chips or whether we'll see a MacBook Pro update in 2024.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Mac Studio</strong> - The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> was updated with &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chips in June 2023, so it could get an update with M3 chips at some point in 2024. Apple has not yet unveiled an M3 Ultra chip.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Mac Pro</strong> - Like the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> was refreshed in June 2023 with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra. There's no word on when we'll see it updated again as of yet.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Home Hub Device</strong> - Rumors suggest Apple is working on a smart home display that would serve as a central hub for controlling smart home products, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-smart-home-ipad-display/">it could launch</a> as soon as 2024.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>New Display</strong> - There have been multiple rumors of a Pro Display XDR successor, but there's no word on when an update might come. It could be 2024, or it could be later.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="wrap_up">Wrap Up</h2><br/>
Based on what we're hearing so far, 2024 is going to be a monumental year for Apple. Along with the Vision Pro, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup is set to get an overhaul, and the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models have some exciting features. We're also counting on a suite of new AI features in the software updates that are coming this year.<br/>

The year kicked off in January with an unusual array of hardware releases consisting of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-announces-new-homepod/">relaunch of the HomePod</a> alongside the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-announces-m2-pro-macbook-pro/">M2 Pro and M2 Max MacBook Pros</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/new-m2-m2-pro-mac-mini/">M2 and M2 Pro Mac mini</a>. In May, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/09/apple-announces-final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-for-ipad/">Apple announced</a> Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, extending its own professional-grade creative tools to its tablet users for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
June was particularly eventful with the announcement of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, tvOS 17, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> at WWDC.
