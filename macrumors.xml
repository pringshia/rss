		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began selling a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 Case on a standalone basis, allowing customers who own the Lightning charging case to upgrade to USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914627" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/airpods-pro-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The standalone USB-C &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; Case is priced at &#36;99 <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUYG3AM/A/magsafe-charging-case-usb%E2%80%91c-for-airpods-pro-2nd-generation">from Apple's online store</a>, and the listing was first noticed by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/24000010/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-case-now-available">The Verge</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
Orders placed today for the USB-C charging case will deliver to customers between December 27 and January 2, which is after the Christmas holiday.<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced a new version of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 with USB-C Charging Case in September, but at the time, there was no option to buy a USB-C case on its own. Customers with the Lightning-based &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 had no upgrade path, but those who want to have USB-C charging across all of their devices can now pay a &#36;99 fee to get the new version.<br/>
<br/>
The USB-C Charging Case is compatible with the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. It continues to offer &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging as well, just like the Lightning model.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to a USB-C port, the USB-C Charging Case also provides improved IP54 dust resistance, but it will not add lossless audio for the Vision Pro, which is a feature added to the updated &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 that come with the USB-C Charging Case. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/apple-selling-standalone-usb-c-airpods-pro-case/">Apple Now Selling Standalone USB-C AirPods Pro Case for &#36;99</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-standalone-usb-c-airpods-pro-case-for-99.2413617/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple might soon face a setback in its EU antitrust battle with Spotify, which filed a complaint against the iPhone maker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/">over four years ago</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-vs-Spotify-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801789" /><br/>
EU regulators are planning to force Apple to allow competing music services like Spotify to direct users to payment methods other than the App Store's in-app purchase system within their apps, or face a fine of as much as 10% of its annual sales, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-13/apple-set-to-be-hit-by-eu-antitrust-order-in-app-store-fight-with-spotify">Bloomberg</a></em>. The decision is slated to be announced in early 2024, the report says.<br/>
<br/>
Apple currently prevents apps from letting users know about a purchasing method other than the App Store's in-app purchase system within their apps, although it does allow developers to inform customers by email. If and when the EU's order takes effect, Apple would be required to drop this so-called "anti-steering" rule. It's unclear if Spotify will be allowed to accept payments directly within its app, or merely advertise other payment methods.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify has been unwilling to let customers subscribe to its streaming music service for its usual price of &#36;10.99 per month within its iPhone app, as it would receive less due to Apple's 15% to 30% commission on in-app purchases. Spotify has argued that being unable to let iPhone users know about other payment options is anticompetitive.<br/>
<br/>
We will update this story if Apple responds to the report.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/eu-plans-to-end-apple-anti-steering-rule/">EU Plans to Let Spotify Direct Users to Other Payment Options on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-plans-to-let-spotify-direct-users-to-other-payment-options-on-iphone.2413613/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google, Meta, Qualcomm, Nothing, Lenovo, Opera and several other tech companies have announced a collaborative effort to push for "open digital ecosystems" in what appears to be a pointed move against Apple (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-meta-qualcomm-team-up-push-open-digital-ecosystems-2023-12-13/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-837104" /><br/>
The group, calling itself the Coalition for Open Digital Ecosystems (CODE), seeks to encourage more open platforms and systems in Europe. Other members include Motorola, Chinese smartphone brand Honor, French augmented reality start-up Lynx, and German messaging service provider Wire. Apple is noticeably absent from the organization's members.<br/>
<br/>
CODE's formation comes in response to new EU rules such as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which designates major tech companies as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">gatekeepers</a>" and compels them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. The DMA is expected to force Apple to make significant changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> work in Europe. For example, Apple will next year be obliged to allow users to install third-party app stores and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/">sideload apps</a>, as well as give developers the ability to promote their offers outside the ‌‌‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌‌‌ and use third-party payment systems.<br/>
<br/>
CODE plans to work with companies, legislators, and academics to promote digital openness and present pathways for this to be achieved in Europe using the DMA and future EU legislation. Members have discussed how digital ecosystems should work in Europe and what positively impacts competitiveness and openness. The organisation aims to open up major digital ecosystems using cross-industry collaboration to promote seamless connectivity and interoperability between systems.<br/>
<br/>
While the likes of Google and Meta have been officially designated as gatekeepers by the EU just like Apple, rivals are increasingly attempting to use EU law to prompt major changes to Apple's ecosystem. For example, last month, Google and European telecom groups <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/google-asks-eu-to-force-open-imessage/">urged EU regulators</a> to designate iMessage a "core" service that would force Apple to make the communications platform interoperable with competing chat services.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/motorola/">Motorola</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lenovo/">Lenovo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/opera-browser/">Opera Browser</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nothing/">Nothing</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/apple-rivals-unite-to-promote-open-ecosystems/">Apple Rivals Unite to Promote Open Ecosystems Using EU Law</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rivals-unite-to-promote-open-ecosystems-using-eu-law.2413595/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17.2, Apple lets you customize the alert tone used by your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> for default notifications. This is good news for anyone who does not like the "Rebound" tone that Apple introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" /><br/>
In previous versions of iOS, Apple allowed users to choose a ring tone and a text tone, as well as custom alert sounds for email, calendar, and reminder alerts. Anything else that threw up notifications used a default sound, and there was no way to change it.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Apple then changed the original default alert sound, from "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYHdfDJrwMU">Tri-tone</a>" to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjveF8Vtw6c">Rebound</a>." Many users disliked the change, with some arguing that the new sound is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/737407">harder to hear</a>. So the new ability in iOS 17.2 to change the default sound to whatever you like should come as welcome news.<br/>
<br/>
To change the tone - as well as the haptic vibration – of notifications from apps that use the default sound, follow these steps.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap Sounds & Haptics.</li><br/>
<li>Select Default Alerts.</li><br/>
<li>Choose a sound for the alert tone. You can use one from Apple's built-in options, buy a tone from the Tone Store, or opt for no sound (None) instead.</li><br/>
<li>To change the accompanying haptic vibration, tap through to Haptics. There you can choose a vibration from the pre-set options, make your own via Create New Vibration, or opt for None.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/default-notification-sound.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926296" /><br/>
<br/>
After completing the steps above, any notification sound that uses the default alert tone will use the sound you selected. If you're not happy with your changes, you can use the same steps to revert to the original "Rebound" default alert.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/change-iphone-default-notification-sound/">iOS 17.2: How to Change Your iPhone&#039;s Default Notification Sound</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-how-to-change-your-iphones-default-notification-sound.2413591/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/apple-expands-self-service-repair-and-introduces-new-diagnostics-process/">announced</a> it has expanded its Self Service Repair program to cover the iPhone 15 lineup and Mac models powered by M2 chips, including the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, the 15-inch MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Pro, and Mac Studio. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Self-Service-Repair-Program-iPhone.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895789" /><br/>
Apple also said that Self Service Repair is now available for Apple users in 24 additional European countries, including Croatia, Denmark, Greece, Netherlands, Portugal, and Switzerland. With this latest expansion, Self Service Repair now supports 35 Apple products in 33 countries and 24 languages.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Apple Diagnostics for Self Service Repair is available today in the U.S. for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/101965">iPhones</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102488">Macs</a>, with availability in Europe to come next year. Intended for users with the knowledge and expertise to repair Apple devices, Apple Diagnostics troubleshooting sessions gives customers the same ability as Apple Authorized Service Providers and Independent Repair Providers to test devices for optimal part functionality and performance, as well as identify which parts may need repair.<br/>
<br/>
Launched in 2022, Apple's Self Service Repair program is designed to allow Apple device owners to do their own repairs in their homes using Apple parts, repair manuals, and tools.<br/>
<br/>
To conduct a repair, customers first need to review the repair manual for their product and the specific repair on Apple's support website. After, they'll be able to order the required parts and tools from the Self Service Repair Store and begin the repair. <br/>
<br/>
The program is part of Apple's efforts to "further expand access to repairs," according to the company. That said, Apple cautions that the "vast majority" of customers should still visit a professional repair provider, such as an Apple Store, to ensure their devices are repaired safely and reliably. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/">Self Service Repair</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/apple-expands-self-service-repair-iphone-15/">Apple Expands Self Service Repair in Europe, Now Covers iPhone 15 and M2 Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expands-self-service-repair-in-europe-now-covers-iphone-15-and-m2-macs.2413590/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, Apple introduced design changes like a curved frame and a frosted glass back. Information acquired by <em>MacRumors</em> suggests that Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> will build on these updates with modifications to the buttons and the camera layout.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Mock-Back-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925836" /><br/>
We have details on early pre-production designs for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, including a look at the variants and hardware configurations that Apple has considered so far. Our information comes early in the design process, but it provides an indication of what we can expect from the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, or DeLorean as Apple engineers refer to it internally. <br/>
<br/>
We've included mockups of what the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; could look like based on Apple's internal designs, down to the exact colors the company is using for testing. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> rendered in yellow features the earliest known button design with an Action Button, unified volume button, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X-style camera bump. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in pink has an Action Button and separate mechanical volume buttons, while the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in midnight has the larger Action button and new Capture button. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; rendered in black is the design we are expecting at this point.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; design process, Apple has prototyped multiple hardware configurations. While these look similar at first glance, there are a number of differences between them. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Mock-Cameras-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925734" /><br/>
The most obvious and visually distinct change is a new vertical camera arrangement. Unlike its predecessor, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will have vertically aligned rear cameras, making the phone easily recognizable as the latest model. While the vertical alignment of the rear cameras has so far remained constant throughout different development stages, Apple is considering two different camera bump designs: <br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12-style design, with two camera lenses located one above the other</li><br/>
<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X-type design, with a singular pill-shaped enclosure</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Relative to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, the location of the flash is the same with both designs, which suggests that Apple does not plan to change the position of the flash. While both designs have been considered, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12-like camera layout with two distinct lenses has been used more extensively on Apple's prototype units. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Mock-Left.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925735" /><br/>
The earliest known prototypes of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; included a unified volume button that was developed as part of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-haptic-button-overview/">now-canceled Bongo project</a> originally intended for release with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. The unified button would have provided users with haptic feedback, but it was scrapped earlier this year following unresolved technical issues. After the cancelation of the Bongo project, Apple moved back to mechanical buttons for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The Action button is another carry-over from the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. That we're seeing the Action button this early on suggests Apple last year had decided to phase out the mute switch, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">plans to standardize the Action button across the entire iPhone 16 range</a>. The size of the Action Button has varied across different configurations. Some designs and prototypes feature a significantly larger Action Button, which was created as part of Project Atlas in an effort to change the Action Button from mechanical to capacitive, while some have the same button that's on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. Signs point to a capacitive Action Button at this time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Mock-Right.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925736" /><br/>
Apple is also experimenting with a new button on the right side of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. As <em>MacRumors</em> revealed back in September, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; is expected to include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">an all-new capacitive Capture Button</a>, developed internally under the codename Project Nova. Information from our sources suggests that this button will feature a force sensor in addition to  "tact-switching" functionality, although it is still unclear what the latter entails. The Capture Button is located in the same spot as the mmWave cutout on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models sold in the United States, so with the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, the mmWave antenna has been moved to the left side of the device.<br/>
<br/>
While it looks like we're getting a new button, Apple has developed an alternate hardware configuration that does not feature a Capture Button, which it could revert to if there are hardware issues during the button's development.<br/>

The front of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; does not feature any noticeable changes, and it continues to use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>. The base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; is expected to feature a display similar to the one used on its predecessor, with no major differences. As with the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; has a USB-C port at the bottom of the device.<br/>
<br/>
As far as colors are concerned, early prototypes have been seen in three colors: yellow, pink and midnight, while documentation suggests that other color options initially developed for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; were also used for testing at one point.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up, though the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; won't have notable changes to its chassis, it will have the following key updates:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Vertical camera arrangement, likely similar to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12</li><br/>
<li>New capacitive Capture Button</li><br/>
<li>Capacitive Action Button</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The information presented here accurately portrays and describes early designs of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but the existence of multiple hardware configurations suggests that Apple's design plans have not yet been finalized. The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; is still far from release, and additional changes are always possible.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year, General Motors (GM) announced plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/">phase out Apple's CarPlay</a> and Android Auto in its future electric vehicles, with the company instead relying on an infotainment system co-developed with Google. This has not been a popular decision with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users, and today, GM provided some additional insight into the decision in a discussion with <em><a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/general-motors-removing-apple-carplay-android-auto-for-safety-tim-babbitt/">MotorTrend</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-865725" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/CarPlay-Phone-Call.jpg" alt="" width="1597" height="900" /><br/>
According to Tim Babbitt, GM's head of product for infotainment, GM has driver safety in mind. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> and Android Auto can have issues like bad connections, slow response times, compatibility issues, and connectivity problems, leading drivers to be distracted from the road with smartphone troubleshooting.<br/>
<br/>
Babbitt claims that drivers will be less likely to pick up their phones with a built-in system that does not rely on a service like &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, leading to improved safety on the road. GM does not have any data to prove that an infotainment system is less distracting than &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, nor has it done any testing.<br/>
<br/>
Babbitt cited J.D. Power data suggesting issues with &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; and Android Auto are common complaints from vehicle owners, with customers often blaming the vehicle manufacturer rather than Apple or Google.<br/>
<br/>
The infotainment system that GM plans to adopt instead of &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will have integrated Google apps, including Google Maps and Google Assistant for voice commands, rather than a third-party navigation system. As <em>MotorTrend</em> points out, eliminating &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will provide GM with more control over driver data, and it will allow GM to offer subscription services and apps that allow for purchases of food, gas, and other sundries.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/gm-no-technical-reason-carplay/">Back in August</a>, GM said that choosing not to offer &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; would give it more information about charge state information to assist with navigation routing and provide a better user experience.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will be eliminated in electric vehicles under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC brands. Combustion vehicles from GM will continue to support &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; until they are phased out in favor of an all-electric lineup in 2035.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/gm-carplay-removal-safer-drivers/">GM Says It&#039;s Nixing CarPlay to Make Drivers Safer</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gm-says-its-nixing-carplay-to-make-drivers-safer.2413545/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced a new beta firmware update for the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, AirPods 2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A307, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2/">prior 6A300 firmware</a> released in September. The updates are limited to developers at the current time. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not often provide details or notes on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ or ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.3 beta that Apple released today once again includes support for collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists, allowing &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscribers to build playlists with friends, family members, and others who share their musical tastes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="5484" height="3085" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918890" /><br/>
Apple initially announced collaborative playlist features when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> was released, but the option did not come out at launch. Apple then tested it in iOS 17.2, but ended up pulling the collaborative functionality <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-beta-4-features/">in the fourth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, when you create a new playlist or select an existing playlist, there's a little person-shaped icon that can be tapped to enable collaboration. Choosing this option provides a link where anyone can contribute a song.<br/>
<br/>
Those who want to try it out in iOS 17.3 can click on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/pl.u-kaJH7JG97e?a=join&amp;it=zr6IZVEGZ6tVoblq">the MacRumors playlist link</a> to try adding a song.<br/>
<br/>
The person who started the collaboration can opt to approve those who ask to add songs, but this is not enabled by default. Anyone with the link to a playlist can add music, though the owner can turn off collaboration at any time or remove people.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said earlier this week that collaborative &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; playlists would launch in 2024, which is the right timing for when we expect iOS 17.3 to launch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-beta-apple-music-collaborative-playlists/">iOS 17.3 Beta Adds Collaborative Apple Music Playlists Again</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-adds-collaborative-apple-music-playlists-again.2413531/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the updates available a day after the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-releases-ios-17-2-and-ipados-17-2/">iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3 introduces a Stolen Device Protection feature that limits access to your private information in case someone obtains both your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and your passcode. When activated, it requires <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> identity verification to do things like accessing passwords in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain, turning off Lost Mode, making purchases through Safari with saved payment credentials, and more.<br/>
<br/>
There are also features that require verification <em>and</em> have a one-hour delay to access, such as changing an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; passcode, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; passcode, turning off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and turning off &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;. More details can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">found in our article on Stolen Device Protection</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We are also still waiting on a handful of new features that Apple promised would be coming in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-delays-airplay-in-hotel-rooms/">AirPlay on Hotel Room TVs</a>. Apple recently said that both of these features will be coming in 2024, so we could see them in this beta as iOS 17.3 is expected to launch sometime in January 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also working on app sideloading in the European Union, a next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> feature, and the adoption of<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/"> rich communication services (RCS)</a>, but these may be features that instead come in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-3-and-ipados-17-3-to-developers.2413527/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first iOS 17.3 beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-beta-1-to-developers/">rolling out to developers today</a> includes a new "Stolen Device Protection" feature that is designed to add an additional layer of security in the event someone has stolen your iPhone and also obtained the device's passcode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926120" /><br/>
Earlier this year, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern and Nicole Nguyen reported about instances of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/19/apple-responds-to-iphone-theft-recovery-key-report/">thieves spying on a victim's iPhone passcode before stealing the device</a>, often in public places like bars. The thief can then reset the victim's Apple ID password, turn off Find My, view passwords stored in iCloud Keychain for banking and email accounts, and more. All in all, the report said thieves can essentially "steal your entire digital life."<br/>
<br/>
When Stolen Device Protection is turned on, Face ID or Touch ID authentication is required for additional actions, including viewing passwords or passkeys stored in iCloud Keychain, applying for a new Apple Card, turning off Lost Mode, erasing all content and settings, using payment methods saved in Safari, and more. No passcode fallback is available in the event that the user is unable to complete Face ID or Touch ID authentication. <br/>
<br/>
For especially sensitive actions, including changing the password of the Apple ID account associated with the iPhone, the feature adds a security delay on top of biometric authentication. In these cases, the user must authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, wait one hour, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again. However, Apple said there will be no delay when the iPhone is in familiar locations, such as at home or work.<br/>
<br/>
The opt-in feature can be found in the Settings app under Face ID & Passcode → Stolen Device Protection. iPhone users who update to the iOS 17.3 beta will be prompted with the option to test a preview of the feature following installation, but Apple said this screen will not be shown to users who install the public version of iOS 17.3 coming later.<br/>
<br/>
Actions that will require Face ID or Touch ID authentication when the feature is turned on:<ul><li>Viewing/using passwords or passkeys saved in iCloud Keychain</li><br/>
<li>Applying for a new Apple Card</li><br/>
<li>Viewing an Apple Card virtual card</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Lost Mode</li><br/>
<li>Erasing all content and settings</li><br/>
<li>Taking certain Apple Cash and Savings actions in Wallet</li><br/>
<li>Using payment methods saved in Safari</li><br/>
<li>Using your iPhone to set up a new device</li></ul>Actions that will require Face ID or Touch ID authentication and have a one-hour security delay when the feature is turned on:<ul><li>Changing your Apple ID password</li><br/>
<li>Updating select Apple ID account security settings, including adding or removing a trusted device, trusted phone number, Recovery Key, or Recovery Contact</li><br/>
<li>Changing your iPhone passcode</li><br/>
<li>Adding or removing Face ID or Touch ID</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Find My</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Stolen Device Protection</li></ul>Apple said it plans to share additional documentation about Stolen Device Protection over time to clarify how the feature works. The option will be available on all iPhone models that are compatible with iOS 17, including the iPhone XS and newer. iOS 17.3 will likely be released to the public in January or February.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">iOS 17.3 Beta Adds New Stolen Device Protection Feature to iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-adds-new-stolen-device-protection-feature-to-iphone.2413526/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.3 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-seds-tvos-17-3-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Beta of tvOS 17.3 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-tvos-17-3-to-developers.2413522/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.3‌ update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, watchOS 10.3 can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the seventh beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that runs on the Vision Pro headset. The sixth beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-releases-visionos-beta-6/">came out in November</a>, so it has been a month since Apple last released a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people do not have access to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta, and it is not entirely clear what Apple is adding in each &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is letting developers attend Vision Pro labs around the world, and developers who visit these locations are able to test the Vision Pro in person and get help from Apple engineers on their &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is not expected until early 2024, so Apple still has time to refine the hardware and software.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/apple-releases-seventh-beta-of-visionos/">Apple Releases Seventh Beta of visionOS</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-seventh-beta-of-visionos.2413520/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.geekbench.com">Geekbench</a> developer Primate Labs has announced a new 0.6 preview version of Geekbench ML that expands beyond iOS and Android to offer benchmarking capabilities for AI and other machine learning workflows on desktop platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/geekbench-ml-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926100" /><br/>
<blockquote>AI and ML-related workflows aren’t just confined to mobile, and hardware architecture on desktop and laptop devices is changing to accommodate this shift in computing. With this latest 0.6 preview, Geekbench ML now supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. This means you’ll be able to see how machine learning-powered tasks run on your desktop, laptop, or even a server — whether it has new AI-specific hardware or not. And, as always, our models and data sets are identical across all supported platforms, making scores comparable.</blockquote>With new and improved frameworks, Geekbench ML supports faster performance on the latest hardware using more up-to-date models including for Core ML on iOS and macOS.<br/>
<br/>
New workloads for Geekbench ML include Depth Estimation to reflect capabilities related to software-assisted portrait mode photo effects, Style Transfer to measure the ability to transform one image into the style of another one, and Image Super-Resolution to assess AI-driven image upscaling.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/geekbench-ml-mac.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1041" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926101" /><br/>
Geekbench ML 0.6 is still a preview release that Primate Labs will continue to tweak based on results and feedback, so scores from version 0.6 can't be directly compared to those from the previous 0.5 release. Primate Labs is looking toward a polished 1.0 release at some point in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench ML is available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geekbench-ml/id1563487010">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.primatelabs.banff">Google Play Store</a>, and Primate Labs is directly hosting preview versions for <a href="https://cdn.geekbench.com/GeekbenchML-0.6.0-Mac.zip">macOS</a>, <a href="https://cdn.geekbench.com/GeekbenchML-0.6.0-WindowsSetup.exe">Windows</a>, and <a href="https://cdn.geekbench.com/GeekbenchML-0.6.0-Linux.tar.gz">Linux</a> on its website.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/geekbench-ml-macos/">Geekbench Machine-Learning Benchmark Tools Add Support for macOS and Other Desktop Platforms</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/geekbench-machine-learning-benchmark-tools-add-support-for-macos-and-other-desktop-platforms.2413518/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[TSMC has already demonstrated prototype 2nm chips to Apple ahead of their expected introduction in 2025, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9be182f-ec9e-4426-9cd2-d5181fd64778"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-silicon-1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1422" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924673" /><br/>
Apple is said to be closely aligned with TSMC in the race to develop and implement 2nm chip technology, which will surpass their current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> chips and associated nodes in terms of transistor density, performance, and efficiency. 2nm chips are expected to be integral in underpinning future Apple silicon chips, as well as next-generation data center and artificial intelligence technology. Test results for TSMC's "N2" 2nm prototype chips have already been showcased to Apple and several other key TSMC clients as plans for upcoming chips begin to solidify.<br/>
<br/>
In a separate report, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231211PD229.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a> points out that Apple is a key player in TSMC's battle against Samsung and Intel to bring 2nm chips to market, with no sign of the close relationship between the two companies waning. Apple reportedly has no plans to reduce its &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; or 2nm chip orders from TSMC before 2027 at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was the first company to utilize TSMC's &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; technology with the A17 Pro chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, and the company is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker's N2 chips. TSMC's production of 2nm chips is slated to begin in 2025, with their first appearance in Apple devices likely to follow soon after.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ft-com/">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology/">TSMC Demos Next-Gen Chip Technology to Apple Ahead of 2025 Debut</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology-to-apple-ahead-of-2025-debut.2413498/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
