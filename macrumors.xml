		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/ipad-9-discontinued-ipad-10-now-starts-at-349/">discontinued the ninth-generation iPad</a> with a Lightning port last week, meaning that its entire iPad lineup now uses USB-C. However, the company still sells a handful of devices and accessories with Lightning for now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/lightning-connector-feature-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-891738" /><br/>
The list of products that Apple still sells with a Lightning port or connector includes some older iPhone models, the standard AirPods, the over-ear AirPods Max, the first-generation Apple Pencil, and a trio of Magic accessories for the Mac:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone SE</li><br/>
<li>Second-generation and third-generation AirPods</li><br/>
<li>AirPods Max</li><br/>
<li>First-generation Apple Pencil</li><br/>
<li>Magic Keyboard</li><br/>
<li>Magic Mouse</li><br/>
<li>Magic Trackpad</li></ul>Apple has been gradually switching most of its products to USB-C, including the entire iPhone 15 series and the second-generation AirPods Pro last year, and AirPods Max with a USB-C port are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/new-airpods-later-this-year-rumor/">rumored to launch later this year</a>. Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack and the MagSafe Duo Charger</a>, which charge via Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first introduced the Lightning port on the iPhone 5 in 2012.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lightning/">Lightning</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/apple-still-sells-these-products-with-lightning/">Apple Still Sells These Devices With Lightning After Discontinuing iPad 9</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-sells-these-devices-with-lightning-after-discontinuing-ipad-9.2426437/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Hands-On With the New M4 OLED iPad Pro</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Today is the official launch day of the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, and these updated tablets mark the biggest feature and design refresh that we've seen for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; in several years. We picked up one of the new 13-inch models to check out everything new.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWuU5KhlVac" title="M4 OLED iPad Pro First Impressions | It&#39;s Beautiful &#x1f60d;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" data-thumb-size="hqdefault" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
When it comes to design, Apple is still offering 11-inch and 13-inch size options and the look hasn't changed a whole lot, but the bezels are slimmer and the iPads themselves are super thin. The 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is the thinnest device Apple has made to date at 5.1mm, while the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is 5.3mm.<br/>
<br/>
With the 13-inch model weighing in just over a pound, the decrease in weight and size is noticeable and makes it feel much more portable. The 11-inch model is under a pound, so it's even easier to carry around. This is a design change that you'll feel if you've used a 2018 or later &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The OLED display is, unsurprisingly, super nice. It's bright, the colors are vibrant, the blacks are incredibly black, and the contrast is much improved. The mini-LED display of the prior-generation 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was good, but this is better. Still, if you have that one, it's probably not worth upgrading for OLED. Nano-texture, an add-on option for higher-end models, cuts down on glare, but it also diminishes the OLED display a bit because of the matte finish.<br/>
<br/>
Apple moved the camera to the landscape edge of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, which makes a lot of sense because most people are probably using it in that orientation. Video calls no longer require turning the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> into an awkward position if you have a keyboard attached. Note that Apple did pull the Ultra Wide camera, so there's just a single Wide lens and a LiDAR sensor.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 chip is incredibly fast, fast enough that it's likely most people purchasing an &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; aren't going to be able to take full advantage of its capabilities. It's going to be hard to max this chip out, and it'll handle audio and video editing with ease. Apple is focusing heavily on AI with its new operating system updates, so those AI will be able to take advantage of that processing power, and it'll come in handy for future proofing.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to use the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; for anything that involves typing, the Magic Keyboard is a must. It's priced starting at &#36;299, but it's thin, light weight, and the aluminum hand rest makes it feel Mac-like. It's got good key travel and the glass trackpad is a major improvement.<br/>
<br/>
For <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> users, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro's haptic feedback is the most noticeable change. With the squeeze gesture, you can swap tools more quickly and have more feedback when creating sketches and art. Barrel roll also lets you use the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; more like an actual writing or drawing implement. The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; charges magnetically, and pairs automatically, like prior versions.<br/>
<br/>
The only real downside to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is the software that it's running. iPadOS is still so limited compared to macOS, especially for multitasking and app functionality. Federico Viticci's recent writeup on the iPadOS basics that Apple gets wrong is <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/not-an-ipad-pro-review/">well worth a read</a>. Still, there are some workflows that are adaptable to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it's a great portable machine. If you're a person who can make use of a tablet, this is the best one you can get.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/m4-ipad-pro-hands-on/">Hands-On With the New M4 OLED iPad Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-the-new-m4-oled-ipad-pro.2426428/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features/">new iOS 18 accessibility features</a> that Apple previewed today is a Reader Mode in the Magnifier app, which will convert words in images to uniform lines of text. Apple did not provide any specific details about the feature, but it shared a screenshot showing that users will be able to change the font and have the text read aloud.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Magnifier-Reader-Mode-Article.jpg" alt="" width="2322" height="1306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950878" /><br/>
Apple also revealed that iOS 18 will allow iPhone users to easily launch the Magnifier app's Detection Mode with the Action button, which debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro models and is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">rumored to expand to the entire iPhone 16 lineup</a> later this year. Detection Mode can identify and read aloud all text within an iPhone camera's field of view.<br/>
<br/>
It is already possible to set the Action button to open the Magnifier app in general, so this will be an expansion of the app's integration with the button.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is expected to be unveiled at Apple's developers conference WWDC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">on June 10</a>, and the update should be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/accessibility/">Accessibility</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/apple-previews-ios-18-magnifier-app/">Apple Previews iOS 18&#039;s Upgraded Magnifier App With New Reader Mode</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-previews-ios-18s-upgraded-magnifier-app-with-new-reader-mode.2426426/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-announces-new-accessibility-features-including-eye-tracking/">announced</a> new accessibility features coming to its devices later this year, and one feature in particular that is likely to have widespread appeal among vehicle passengers is Vehicle Motion Cues, which aims to prevent motion sickness when looking at an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/vehicle-motion-cues.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950825" /><br/>
According to Apple, research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; while riding in a moving vehicle. <br/>
<br/>
Vehicle Motion Cues are designed to avoid this sensory conflict with the use of visual elements on the display that indicate real-time changes in motion. Apple explains:<br/>
<blockquote>With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognises when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.</blockquote>In addition to Vehicle Motion Cues, Apple is also set to introduce an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features/">eye tracking feature</a> that will let users navigate their &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with just their eyes. It will also debut <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> voice control and new Music Haptics later this year. The latter uses the Taptic Engine in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to play taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music, allowing users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music. The new features are expected to arrive as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, which is likely to be released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/accessibility/">Accessibility</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/apple-reduce-motion-sickness-feature/">Apple to Reduce Motion Sickness With Vehicle Motion Cues on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-reduce-motion-sickness-with-vehicle-motion-cues-on-iphone.2426409/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-announces-new-accessibility-features-including-eye-tracking/">previewed</a> many new accessibility features coming later this year with software updates like iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, and visionOS 2. The announcement comes one day ahead of Global Accessibility Awareness Day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Hover-Typing-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950842" /><br/>
The key new accessibility features for the iPhone and/or iPad will include:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Eye Tracking</li><br/>
<li>Music Haptics</li><br/>
<li>Vocal Shortcuts</li><br/>
<li>Vehicle Motion Cues</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Mac users will gain the ability to customize VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts, and Mandarin support for Personal Voice, while the Vision Pro will get systemwide Live Captions, Reduce Transparency, Smart Invert, and Dim Flashing Lights.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Eye Tracking</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPadOS-18-Eye-Tracking.jpg" alt="" width="1135" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950815" /><br/>
Apple says Eye Tracking on the iPhone and iPad will allow users to navigate system interfaces and apps with just their eyes:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Powered by artificial intelligence, Eye Tracking gives users a built-in option for navigating iPad and iPhone with just their eyes. Designed for users with physical disabilities, Eye Tracking uses the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate in seconds, and with on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on device, and isn't shared with Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Eye Tracking works across iPadOS and iOS apps, and doesn't require additional hardware or accessories. With Eye Tracking, users can navigate through the elements of an app and use Dwell Control to activate each element, accessing additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes, and other gestures solely with their eyes.</blockquote><br/>
<h2>Music Haptics</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Music-Haptics.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950832" /><br/>
When this feature is turned on, the iPhone's Taptic Engine will play "taps, textures, and refined vibrations" that correspond with the audio of the music: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Music Haptics is a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music on iPhone. With this accessibility feature turned on, the Taptic Engine in iPhone plays taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music. Music Haptics works across millions of songs in the Apple Music catalog, and will be available as an API for developers to make music more accessible in their apps.</blockquote><br/>
<h2>Vocal Shortcuts</h2><br/>
Vocal Shortcuts will allow iPhone and iPad users to assign "custom utterances" that Siri can understand to "launch shortcuts and complete complex tasks."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Vocal-Shortcuts.jpeg" alt="" width="2612" height="1828" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950837" /><br/>
<h2>Vehicle Motion Cues</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/vehicle-motion-cues.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950825" /><br/>
This feature is designed to reduce motion sickness while looking at an iPhone or iPad's screen in a moving vehicle:<blockquote>With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.</blockquote>Read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/apple-reduce-motion-sickness-feature/">standalone coverage of this feature</a> to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>CarPlay</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CarPlay-Sound-Recognition.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="718" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950848" /><br/>
CarPlay will be gaining Voice Control, Color Filters, and Sound Recognition.<br/>
<br/>
Sound Recognition on CarPlay will allow drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing to turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Live Captions on Vision Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Vision-Pro-Live-Captions.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950857" /><br/>
visionOS 2 will support Live Captions, allowing users who are deaf or hard of hearing to follow along with spoken dialogue in live conversations and in audio from apps.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Features</h2><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Hover-Typing.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950854" /><em>Hover Typing will show larger text when typing in a text field</em></div><br/>
Apple outlined many more accessibility features coming to its platforms later this year:<blockquote>- For users who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver will include new voices, a flexible Voice Rotor, custom volume control, and the ability to customize VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts on Mac.<br/>
- Magnifier will offer a new Reader Mode and the option to easily launch Detection Mode with the Action button.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[VMware has <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2024/05/fusion-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html">announced</a> that its Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro virtualization software is now free for personal use. For those unfamiliar with Fusion, it is designed to allow Mac users to operate virtual machines to run non-macOS operating systems like Windows 11.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/vmware-fusion-pro-13.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950804" /><br/>
The decision to make the software free was made by Broadcom, which acquired VMware in November 2023. In a <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2024/05/fusion-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html">blog post</a> announcing the change, Broadcom said the move was part of a plan to simplify how the company brings VMware apps to market: <br/>
<blockquote>Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro will now have two license models. We now provide a Free Personal Use or a Paid Commercial Use subscription for our Pro apps. Users will decide based on their use case whether a commercial subscription is required.<br/>
<br/>
This means that everyday users who want a virtual lab on their Mac, Windows or Linux computer can do so for free simply by registering and downloading the bits from the new download portal located at <a href="https://support.broadcom.com">support.broadcom.com</a>.</blockquote>Broadcom also said it had discontinued Workstation Player and Fusion Player, although existing customers can upgrade to the more feature-packed Pro version at no extra cost. Meanwhile, VMware Player will remain bundled with Workstation Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Broadcom said that customers who use Fusion and Workstation at/for work will still require a paid commercial subscription, which can be purchased through an authorized Broadcom Advantage partner.

		<title>Troubling iOS 17.5 Bug Reportedly Resurfacing Old Deleted Photos</title>

		<description><![CDATA[There are concerning reports on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1cryayx/latest_ios_update_has_brought_back_some_pictures/">Reddit</a> that Apple's latest iOS 17.5 update has introduced a bug that causes old photos that were deleted – in some cases years ago – to reappear in users' photo libraries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943813" /><br/>
After updating their iPhone, one user said they were shocked to find old NSFW photos that they deleted in 2021 suddenly showing up in photos marked as recently uploaded to iCloud. Other users have also chimed in with similar stories. "Same here," said one Redditor. "I have four pics from 2010 that keep reappearing as the latest pics uploaded to iCloud. I have deleted them repeatedly."<br/>
<br/>
"Same thing happened to me," replied another user. "Six photos from different times, all I have deleted. Some I had deleted in 2023." More reports have been trickling in overnight. One said: "I had a random photo from a concert taken on my Canon camera reappear in my phone library, and it showed up as if it was added today." <br/>
<br/>
It's not clear what's happening, but given that some of the photos were apparently taken years ago, this cannot be an issue with recently deleted photos being undeleted. In Apple's Photos app, deleted photos and videos are kept in the Recently Deleted album for 30 days, so that users can recover or permanently remove them from all devices. <br/>
<br/>
The reports could be down to an indexing bug, photo library corruption, or a syncing issue between local devices and iCloud Photos. Another possibility is that in attempting to fix a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1apdktl/a_couple_of_photos_gone_after_iphone/">photo syncing bug that occurred in iOS 17.3</a>, Apple has inadvertently caused a new syncing issue to occur that may involve iCloud backups. Some users running <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1cnjesa/ios_175_db4_two_year_old_photo_i_deleted_long_ago/">iOS 17.5 developer beta 4</a> earlier reported similar experiences.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models feature a battery health setting that is new to iPads and when enabled prevents the devices from charging beyond 80% at all times, which can extend battery lifespan.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m4-iPad-Pro-Horizontal-Feature-Purple-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950742" /><br/>
When the 80% hard limit is enabled, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> will never charge beyond that percentage, except on rare occasions to "maintain accurate battery state-of-charge estimates," according to Apple. Apple says reducing the time that a battery is fully charged can reduce the wear on the battery and improve its lifespan.<br/>
<br/>
From Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/118418">support document</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Reducing the time that your iPad spends fully charged reduces the wear on your battery. With iPad Pro (M4) and iPad Air (M2), you can choose to limit charging at 80 percent, which can help prolong your battery's lifespan. When you choose 80% Limit, your iPad will charge up to about 80 percent and then stop charging. If the battery charge level gets down to 75 percent, charging will resume until your battery charge level reaches about 80 percent again.</blockquote><h2>How to Set an 80% iPad Battery Charge Limit</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Battery ➝ Battery Health</strong>.<br/>
<li>Tap the switch next to <strong>80% Limit</strong> to turn on the feature.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/battery-charge-limit-ipad.jpeg" alt="settings" width="2752" height="2064" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950773" />Note that from the new Battery Health settings menu you can also view the manufacture date of your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s battery, as well as the month and year on which it was first used.<br/>
<br/>
On M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models, you can also find out the cycle count of your device's battery.

For those looking for an iPad Pro size that's more affordable, Apple also launched a new iPad Air in the same 11-inch and 13-inch sizes, but the iPad Air is thicker and heavier, lacks an OLED display, uses Touch ID instead of Face ID, and has an M2 chip instead of an M4 chip. <br/>
<br/>

The new iPads were introduced last week, with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; featuring OLED display technology, a next-generation M4 chip, and a thin and light design that makes it even thinner and lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> "Air." Meanwhile, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; has the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip that was previously in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, providing a nice upgrade over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>, and Apple has also introduced a new 13-inch display size so you can get the Air in two sizes much like the Pro, but it's just an LCD display rather than an OLED display.<br/>

</ul><br/>
Apple also launched a new Magic Keyboard for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with a larger glass trackpad, a function row of keys, and an aluminum palm rest that makes it look more like a MacBook than ever, plus there's an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro that works with both the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
New Zealand doesn't have Apple retail locations, but stores in Australia will have the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models available for purchase. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; didn't sell out and should be readily available, but there is a wait online for the nano-texture glass option on higher-capacity 1TB and 2TB &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
Following New Zealand and Australia, sales and deliveries of the new iPads will kick off in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;599, while pricing on the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;999. The Magic Keyboard is priced starting at &#36;299, while the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro is &#36;129.<br/>

		<title>Latest Version of Android Has Gemini AI at Its Core</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today announced several new AI features that it is building into the Android 15 operating system, giving us some insight into what Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> operating system will be competing with later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/android-ai.jpg" alt="" width="1599" height="899" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950750" /><br/>
According to Google, Android has been designed with AI at its core, and Gemini is a foundational part of the Android experience that works at the system level. There is an AI powered search bar that can be used for answering queries and looking up information, and the Circle to Search feature can be used for solving math and physics problems or getting homework help as of today.<br/>
<br/>
Gemini serves as the AI assistant on Android instead of Google Assistant, and the Gemini AI will be able to be brought up as an overlay on any app that's in use. Gemini is context aware and can anticipate what the smartphone user is doing and provide context in the moment. It can create images for texts and social media, or answer questions about a video that's being watched. It can parse PDFs, websites, and other content, providing summaries and translating.<br/>
<br/>
Google is using on-device AI for some features in order to keep sensitive data private, and this is also Apple's plan. Multiple rumors have suggested that many of Apple's first AI features will run on-device rather than through a cloud server.<br/>
<br/>
Gemini Nano, Google's on-device AI, currently does things like generate smart replies in messaging apps and summarize voice memos. Gemini Nano with Multimodality is coming to Pixel phones later this year, enabling new on-device AI features like TalkBack, which can help blind and low-vision users better interpret the world around them. Google is also developing a call screening feature that actively listens to calls and lets users know if it sounds like a scam.<br/>
<br/>
Google today also announced Gemini 1.5 Flash, a lightweight version of its Gemini Pro AI model. Gemini Flash is more efficient, less expensive, and has lower latency, which makes it ideal for large scale rollouts. Google says that Gemini 1.5 Flash is able to deliver "impressive quality" for its size, excelling at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, and data extraction from long documents.<br/>
<br/>
Gemini 1.5 Pro has also been improved and it is able to follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including parsing documents up to 1,500 pages long or an hour of video content. Gemini can be interacted with in Google Messages, and Gemini Advanced subscribers will be able to experience a new mobile conversational experience that makes speaking with Gemini more intuitive. Customized versions of Gemini called Gems are also available to subscribers, for personalized assistants that can help with workouts, provide recipes, and more, with specific personalities.<br/>
<br/>
Project Astra, another Google effort, focuses on AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. Google demoed prototype agents able to identify objects, provide context on information from the camera, and recall a timeline of events for finding a lost item.<br/>
<br/>

Google plans to provide more information on new features coming to Android 15 later this week.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/android-ai-gemini/">Latest Version of Android Has Gemini AI at Its Core</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-version-of-android-has-gemini-ai-at-its-core.2426337/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> has shown up in China's product regulatory database as Apple prepares to bring the headset to additional countries sometime in the near future. Both the Vision Pro (A2117) and its Battery Pack (A2697) have shown up in the Chinese database, indicating that a launch in China could be coming soon.<br/>

<em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/vision-pro-expanded-launch-after-wwdc/">said yesterday</a> that Apple is planning to introduce the Vision Pro in a number of additional countries following the Worldwide Developers Conference, but Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> claimed in February that Vision Pro sales would expand to more countries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/">before WWDC</a> rather than after. <br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/vision-pro-keyboard-new-languages/">previously found evidence</a> in Apple's backend code that Vision Pro would expand to Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, and it appears that information was correct as retail employees from these countries have been visiting Apple's Cupertino headquarters for Vision Pro training in recent days. <br/>
<br/>
When the Vision Pro launched in the United States in February, Apple said that it would bring the device to additional countries "later this year," but the company did not provide a list of countries, timing, or pricing.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/vision-pro-chinese-database/">Vision Pro Appears in Chinese Regulatory Database Before Expansion to New Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-appears-in-chinese-regulatory-database-before-expansion-to-new-countries.2426333/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/app-store-stopped-over-7-billion-usd-in-potentially-fraudulent-transactions/">today shared</a> its fourth annual fraud prevention analysis, providing insight into how the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>'s rules protect users from fraudulent apps and other security issues.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/app-store-fraud-2024.jpeg" alt="" width="1306" height="736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950726" /><br/>
Apple says that it prevented over &#36;1.8 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2023 alone, and &#36;7 billion during the period from 2020 to 2023. Apple blocked more than 14 million stolen credit cards and banned more than 3.3 million accounts from further transactions.<br/>
<br/>
Over 1.7 million apps were rejected in 2023 for not meeting Apple's standards for privacy, security, and content. 118,000 developer accounts were terminated, down from 428,000 last year. The drop came from new efforts to prevent the creation of fraudulent accounts in the first place, plus more than 91,000 developer enrollments were rejected for fraud concerns.<br/>
<br/>
More than 153 million fraudulent customer accounts were blocked, and close to 374 million developer and customer accounts were terminated. Apple says that it detected and blocked 47,000 illegitimate apps on pirate storefronts, and stopped almost 3.8 million attempts to install or launch apps that were illicitly distributed through the Enterprise Program.<br/>
<br/>
The app review team reviewed 6.9 million app submissions in 2023, and helped 192,000 developers publish their first apps on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apple says that there has been an uptick in apps that misrepresented themselves as non-harmful products and later transformed into pirate movie streaming platforms or illegal gambling apps, which the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; team has worked to block.<br/>
<br/>
Some financial service apps involved in "complex and malicious" social engineering efforts to defraud users were identified and removed, and Apple says a total of 40,000 apps were pulled for bait and switch activity. Another 38,000 apps were rejected for undocumented or hidden features, and 375,000 apps were rejected for privacy violations.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's report comes following changes in the European Union that have allowed for apps to be installed outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, skirting some of the app review process. Apps distributed from alternative app marketplaces or websites must undergo a safety notarization process, but Apple does not check for content. Apple has claimed that downloading apps outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will put users at risk for scams, fraud, and privacy issues. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/apple-fraud-prevention-analysis-2024/">Apple Says It Stopped &#36;7 Billion in Fraudulent Transactions in Last 4 Years</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-it-stopped-7-billion-in-fraudulent-transactions-in-last-4-years.2426324/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new iPad Pro and iPad Air will begin arriving to customers over the next 24 hours. It appears that the initial batch of the devices will have a <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1790190359445655828">special build of iPadOS 17.4 preinstalled</a>, but an <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1790188873697362295">iPadOS 17.5 software update will be available</a> in the Settings app right away, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-and-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950313" /><br/>
iPadOS 17.5 has a special build number of 21F84 on the new iPads, and modified release notes that mention improved document scanning:<blockquote>Apple News+<br/>
• Offline mode in Apple News+ gives you access to the Today feed and News+ tab, even when you don't have an internet connection<br/>
• Quartiles is a new and original daily word game that is now available in Apple News+<br/>
• Scoreboard in News+ Puzzles gives you access to new player data for Crossword, Mini Crossword and Quartiles, including stats and streaks<br/>
<br/>
Tracking Notifications<br/>
• Cross-Platform Tracking Detection delivers notifications to users if a compatible Bluetooth tracker they do not own is moving with them, regardless of what operating system the device is paired with<br/>
<br/>
Document Scanning<br/>
• Document scanning is improved on the new iPad Air and iPad Pro</blockquote>The new iPad Pro models with the M4 chip are equipped with "adaptive True Tone flash" for improved document scanning. It is unclear if the feature requires iPadOS 17.5, or if the update simply further optimizes the functionality.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-Improved-Document-Scanning.jpg" alt="" width="5100" height="2868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950698" /><br/>
With adaptive True Tone flash and AI, the new iPad Pro can eliminate shadows on scanned documents, as Apple explained in a press release:<blockquote>It also now features a new adaptive True Tone flash that makes document scanning on the new iPad Pro better than ever. Using AI, the new iPad Pro automatically identifies documents right in the Camera app, and if a shadow is in the way, it instantly takes multiple photos with the new adaptive flash, stitching the scan together for a dramatically better scan.</blockquote>Improved document scanning will be available in the Camera, Files, and Notes apps, and third-party apps will be able to offer the feature too.<br/>
<br/>
The new iPad Air does not have adaptive True Tone flash, so it is unclear how document scanning is improved on those models, as Apple indicates.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 17.5 was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-releases-ios-17-5/">already released on Monday</a> for all other iPads, with a build number of 21F79 and no mention of improved document scanning.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/new-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-day-one-update/">New iPad Pro and iPad Air Will Have Day-One Software Update With These Release Notes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-will-have-day-one-software-update-with-these-release-notes.2426305/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-17.5-Security-Update-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950652" /><br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/mysk_co/status/1790121816872161363">According to Mysk</a>, a security patch related to the MarketplaceKit framework has resulted in a bug that prevents iPhone users in the EU from reinstalling an alternative app marketplace <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/altstore-eu-alternative-app-marketplace/">like AltStore</a> if they happen to delete the app after initially installing it. Apple will likely fix this issue in a subsequent update, such as iOS 17.5.1.<br/>
<br/>
In related news, one security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/R00tkitSMM/status/1790269915028467800">has complained</a> that the iOS kernel vulnerability they discovered was not eligible for payment under the Apple Security Bounty program.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new Magic Keyboard accessory for the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models is "thinner and lighter" than the model it replaces, according to the company. <br/>
<br/>

Apple typically does not provide weight specifications for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> accessories, but some early reviewers have effectively confirmed Apple's claims with their own figures for the 13-inch version of the Magic Keyboard.<br/>

<em>Six Colors</em>' <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/05/m4_ipad_pro_review/">Jason Snell</a> weighed the 13-inch Magic Keyboard at 667 grams, while <a href="https://youtu.be/cOiGtyPTrvU">Brian Tong</a> put the accessory at 662 grams and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review">The Verge</a></em> recorded 658 grams on its scales.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the small variations, from these figures we can conclude that the 13-inch Magic Keyboard is around 50 grams lighter than the previous generation model, which weighed around <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/20/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-heavier-macbook/">710 grams</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that at 580 grams, the new 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; itself is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipad-air-now-heavier-than-ipad-pro/">much lighter</a> than the previous generation 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, which weighed 682 grams. <br/>
<br/>
Based on these numbers, the total weight of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and Magic Keyboard is around 1,247 grams, which is exceedingly close to the stated 1.24 kg weight of Apple's M3-powered 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the 11-inch Magic Keyboard is 580 grams, according to a <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/early-magic-keyboard-and-apple-pencil-pro.2426072/">MacRumors forum member</a> who received theirs early.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> will use an M3 processor, according to details posted on X earlier today by a private account with a proven track record of sharing accurate information about Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M2-iPad-Air-Hero-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949535" /><br/>
Apple just last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-ipad-air-models-in-new-11-13-inch/">announced</a> its latest &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models powered by the company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. The two new 11-inch and 13-inch models replaced the previous M1-powered 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, which was released in 2022. Apple also just announced new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models that were until recently expected to feature the M3 chip. <br/>
<br/>
Combined with Apple's surprise debut of the M4, today's rumor suggests that Apple plans to keep the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; one step behind the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; in terms of processor generations. Given the recent announcements, it's very early to speculate on a future generation of &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, but rumors have suggested that Apple plans to introduce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-oled-roadmap/">10.8-inch OLED iPad Air</a>, and that the tablet could come out <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/ipad-air-oled-adoption-timeline/">between 2026 and 2028</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is nearly 50% faster than the previous &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>, according to Apple. Compared to &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with A14 Bionic, it provides 3x faster performance. Like the previous model, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;599, while the 13-inch device starts at &#36;799, and both sizes are available from Wednesday, May 15.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/next-gen-ipad-air-with-m3-chip-rumored/">Next-Generation iPad Air With M3 Chip Already Rumored</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-generation-ipad-air-with-m3-chip-already-rumored.2426292/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPad Pro: How Apple Intends to Avoid Another &#039;Bendgate&#039; Controversy</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">latest iPad Pro</a> is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/">thinnest device the company has ever made</a>... but does it bend? That's likely to be the question on the mind of anyone who remembers the last iPad Pro "bendgate" controversy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m4-ipad-pro-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950292" /><br/>
In 2018, Apple responded to durability concerns shared by new iPad Pro owners by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/19/apple-2018-ipad-pros-ship-bent/">admitting</a> to shipping its then-new models with a "very slight bend in the aluminum chassis," which it blamed on a "side effect of the manufacturing process." <br/>
<br/>
Despite videos indicating that the 2018 iPad Pro models bent more easily than other models, Apple said the bend did not worsen over time or negatively affect the iPad's performance, and that concerns over the device's durability were unfounded. <br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, some iPad owners were understandably upset to find defects in devices that cost hundreds of dollars. Apple naturally wants to avoid a similar scenario with its latest 2024 models. <br/>
<br/>
To allay concerns, in an <a href="https://x.com/Mrwhosetheboss/status/1789286197925237230">interview with Arun Maini</a>, Apple's senior VP of hardware engineering John Ternus reveals that Apple has added a new protective "cowling" over the main logic board. This metal cover not only helps with heat dissipation, but also "effectively creates a central rib that runs through the whole thing and tremendously improves the stiffness of the products," according to Ternus.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt the new iPad Pro models will be subjected to exaggerated pressure tests by some YouTubers, and we are bound to see more than a few bent out of shape in the process. Whether Apple's strengthend iPad Pro chassis will be enough to withstand the pressures of real-world everyday use over time is altogether another matter.<br/>
<br/>
If <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/m4-ipad-pro/">early reviews</a> are anything to go by, a handful of outlets have noted that the devices do feel particularly durable despite their impressive thinness. Do you have lingering doubts? Let us know in the comments. Pricing on the M4 ‌iPad Pro‌ begins at &#36;999, and it can be purchased from Apple's website.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bendgate/">Bendgate</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/ipad-pro-structural-design-avoid-bendgate/">iPad Pro: How Apple Intends to Avoid Another &#039;Bendgate&#039; Controversy</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-how-apple-intends-to-avoid-another-bendgate-controversy.2426284/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>New iPad Air and iPad Pro Feature Battery Health Menu Including Cycle Count and 80% Charging Limit Option</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest iPad Air and iPad Pro models feature a new Battery Health menu in the Settings app that is not available on older iPads, and which includes options that were once limited to iPhone 15 models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-and-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950313" /><br/>
As confirmed by <em><a href="https://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/batterijconditie-ipads-2024/">iCulture</a></em>, visiting Settings ➝ Battery on the new iPads shows a new Battery Health menu that lists Battery Health (with a readout such as "Normal"), Maximum Capacity, Cycle Count, and a 80% Limit charging optimization option. Users can also see details about when the battery was produced and when it was first used. <br/>
<br/>
Code previously found in iPadOS 17.5 beta software <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/">referenced the Battery Health menu</a>, and it was indeed suggested that it may be limited to Apple's new iPads. Notably, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-battery-cycle-count-iphone-15/">Cycle Count</a> readout and the option to more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-battery-charging-limit/">strictly prevent charging beyond 80%</a> were up until now exclusive features of the iPhone 15 series, and cannot be found on older iPhones either.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iculture-ipad-2024-battery-health-menu.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950589" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: iCulture</em></div><br/>
The 80% Limit is separate from the Optimized Battery Charging feature on earlier iPhones, which intelligently delays charging past 80% until a more appropriate time by learning the device's daily charging routine. When the 80% hard limit is enabled, the iPad will never charge beyond that percentage, except on rare occasions to "maintain accurate battery state-of-charge estimates." Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-asia/108055#:~:text=When%20you%20choose%2080%25%20Limit,reaches%20about%2080%20percent%20again.">says</a> reducing the time that a battery is fully charged can reduce the wear on the battery and improve its lifespan.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/2024-ipad-air-pro-battery-cycle-count/">New iPad Air and iPad Pro Feature Battery Health Menu Including Cycle Count and 80% Charging Limit Option</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-feature-battery-health-menu-including-cycle-count-and-80-charging-limit-option.2426276/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
