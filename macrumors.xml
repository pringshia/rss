		<description><![CDATA[Apple introduced the first version of Apple Intelligence in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 developer betas. While the betas include some useful Apple Intelligence features like Writing Tools, some of the Apple Intelligence additions won't be coming until later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
We've rounded up everything that's not yet been added to the betas, with Apple planning to introduce these features at a later date.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Image Playground</strong> - Both the standalone app and the functionality built into apps like Notes and Messages are missing from the current beta.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Genmoji</strong> - Genmoji is based on Image Playground, and it is unavailable.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Image Wand</strong> - Image Wand, the feature that inserts images into your Notes based on context, is also based on Image Playground so it won't be available until Image Playground is added to the beta.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Priority Notifications</strong> - Priority notifications show up at the top of the notification stack, so you can get to what's most important first. The feature also summarizes your incoming notifications so you can sort through them more quickly.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Mail</strong> - Mail categories that sort your incoming messages are not yet available.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Photos</strong> - While the Memory Maker feature is active in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, the Clean Up tool that removes unwanted objects from images with a tap is not available.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Siri</strong> - Functionality that includes onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability to take more actions in and across apps is not yet available.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>ChatGPT</strong> - ChatGPT integration with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> has not yet been implemented.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Additional Languages</strong> - Apple Intelligence is available in U.S. English only as of now, but support for additional languages will be coming in the future.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Additional Platforms</strong> - As Apple said in its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">WWDC coverage</a> of Apple Intelligence, the Apple Intelligence feature set will eventually expand to additional platforms.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 are only available to developers right now, and Apple Intelligence is still in the early stages of testing. Apple Intelligence features will be available to everyone later this fall in an update to the initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; releases. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/">All of the Apple Intelligence Features Not Included in the iOS 18.1 Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-of-the-apple-intelligence-features-not-included-in-the-ios-18-1-beta.2432499/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.6 update that Apple released today includes dual display support, an important feature specifically for the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro. With the new software, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip is able to run two external displays in clamshell mode, aka when the lid is closed.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919851" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple introduced dual display support in clamshell mode for the M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models when they were released in March 2024, but at the time, the option was not available for the M3 14-inch MacBook Pro released back in October 2023. Apple said at the time that it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-pro-multi-display-support/">planning to release</a> a software update that would add multi-display support to the M3 MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The change is mentioned in Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109035">macOS Sonoma update support document</a> and in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117373">a support document</a> on using dual monitors with the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch M3 MacBook Pro now supports one external display at 6K resolution when the lid is open, or two external displays at 5K resolution at up to 60Hz when the lid is closed.<br/>
<br/>
Higher-end MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips were already able to support multiple displays, so today's change only applies to the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro model.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the display update, &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.6 addresses a number of security vulnerabilities as outlined in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214119">Apple's security support document</a>. None of the vulnerabilities are known to have been actively exploited in the wild, but it is still a good idea to update as soon as possible.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/macos-sonoma-14-6-dual-display-support/">macOS Sonoma 14.6 Adds Dual External Display Support to M3 14-Inch MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sonoma-14-6-adds-dual-external-display-support-to-m3-14-inch-macbook-pro.2432496/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 for developers, introducing the first Apple Intelligence features. Apple Intelligence was previewed in June, and is Apple's version of artificial intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960229" /><br/>
Not all of the Apple Intelligence features are available as of yet, but we've rounded up a list of what's active in the beta. Note that iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 are limited to developers only at this time, with the software set to come out to all users in a beta capacity this fall.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence is in the early stages of refinement, and Apple is working out bugs and polishing the new features before launch. Apple Intelligence will improve over time, and the features that are missing in the developer beta will roll out later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Writing Tools</h2><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-writing-tools.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960221" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Proofread text for spelling and grammar errors, including word choice and sentence structure. You can accept all suggestions with a tap or go through them one by one with explanations. </li><br/>
 	<li>Rewrite for cleaning up what you've written and shifting the tone without impacting your content. Options include Friendly, Professional, and Concise.</li><br/>
 	<li>Options for selecting text and summarizing it. You can choose to create a paragraph, pull out key points, make a list, or create a table. Summaries are available in Mail, Messages, and more.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You can select any text on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac and use Apple Intelligence to access Writing Tools for summaries and other features.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Siri</h2><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960222" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>New glow around the edges of the display when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is activated, applicable to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>. On Mac, the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; window can be placed anywhere. The glow animates responsively to the sound of your voice so you can tell when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is listening without interrupting other things you're doing.</li><br/>
 	<li>A double tap at the bottom of the display brings up the Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interface so you can type requests instead of speaking them. If this isn't working, you may need to restart. On Mac, you need to press the Command key twice to bring up Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; includes suggested requests so you can get your questions answered faster.</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can maintain context between requests so you can ask a question and then reference it in a second reply. If you ask about the temperature in Orlando, for example, and then follow up with "what's the humidity?" &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will know you mean in Orlando.</li><br/>
 	<li>If you stumble over your words when speaking to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, or shift what you're saying mid-sentence, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can follow along.</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has Apple's product knowledge and support base for answering questions about your device's features and settings, and can even find settings when you don't know the exact name.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Mail</h2><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-smart-replies.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960207" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>There is a summarize button for summarizing any of your incoming emails, plus you will see a brief summary of an email in your inbox list rather than the first few lines of the email.</li><br/>
 	<li>Mail surfaces time sensitive messages first when applicable, putting them at the top of your inbox so you see what's important right away.</li><br/>
 	<li>Smart Reply provides quick-tap responses to emails that you've been sent, with contextual options based on what's in the email.</li><br/>
<li>Multiple notifications from Mail will be summarized on your Lock Screen so you can see what's in an email without opening the app.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Messages</h2><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-messages-smart-reply.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960223" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Messages has Smart Reply options for incoming texts, which analyze the content of messages to offer suggestions of what you might want to say.</li><br/>
<li>Multiple Messages notifications are summarized on your Lock Screen.</li><br/>
<br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Photos</h2><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-memory-maker.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960208" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>You can create a Memory Movie with just a description, such as "My cat in 2024," or "Orlando in the summer." The feature automatically picks relevant photos and chooses songs, but you can tweak through the Memory Mixes feature or choose a mood to guide the direction of the audio. You can also add in specific scenes and images you want to see throughout the memory when you're creating the prompt.</li><br/>
 	<li>Natural language search is available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, so you can just describe what you're looking for, such as "Eric rollerskating while wearing green."</li><br/>
 	<li>Search can also find specific moments in video clips.</li><br/>
<li>Search offers up smart complete suggestions for narrowing down what you might want to find</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Transcription</h2><br/>
In Notes and other apps, you can record audio and get a transcript along with a summary of your transcript, which is useful for recording lectures and other audio.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Focus Modes</h2><br/>
There is a dedicated Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode that only shows you important notifications that need attention while filtering out everything else.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-focus-mode-changes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960224" /><br/>
When customizing an existing Focus mode or creating a new one, there is a new toggle to turn on Intelligent Breakthrough and Silencing. This option allows important notifications to interrupt you, while muting notifications that are not important, which is the same thing that the Reduce Notifications Focus does. You can override the notification settings for specific apps and people, which is how it worked prior to iOS 18.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-focus-reduce-interruptions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960225" /><br/>
<h2>Phone</h2><br/>
Phone call recording <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-call-recording-and-transcribing/">is available in iOS 18.1</a>. When starting a call, you can tap on the little record button in the upper left corner of the display. All participants are notified that the call is being recorded before the recording starts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" alt="" width="5416" height="3047" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" /><br/>
Recorded phone calls are stored in the Notes app, where you can tap in to view a transcript and get a summary generated from that transcript.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Safari</h2><br/>
When reading an article in Reader Mode, there is an option to have Apple Intelligence summarize the article for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-safari-summarize.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960226" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Report</h2><br/>
In the Privacy and Security section of the Settings app you can access an Apple Intelligence Report that lets you export your Apple Intelligence data as part of Apple's promise for transparency around Apple Intelligence. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> is required to access and export Apple Intelligence data.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-report.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960227" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Waitlist</h2><br/>
Developers that upgrade to iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, or &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 will need to go to the Settings app and join the Apple Intelligence waitlist. There is a waitlist mechanic to ensure that behind the scenes downloads go smoothly and that the system isn't overloaded.<br/>
<br/>
While on the waitlist, Apple devices download necessary files for on-device processing, and so far, the time from Apple Intelligence waitlist signups to activation has been quick. The waitlist is on a per-account basis, so you only need to sign up for it on one device to have access on multiple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Compatibility</h2><br/>
The iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 betas are only available to registered developers with an eligible device. Devices that cannot run Apple Intelligence will not see the update.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max</li><br/>
 	<li>All Apple silicon iPads</li><br/>
 	<li>All Apple silicon Macs</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Availability</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence is only available in U.S. English at this time, and it is not available to developers in the European Union or China. Device region and language need to be set to the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Launch Date</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence will not be in the initial launch version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> that comes out in September alongside new iPhones. It will instead be introduced in a separate iOS 18.1 update that is likely to come out a few weeks after &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; debuts.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">Here Are All of the Apple Intelligence Features in the iOS 18.1 Developer Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-of-the-apple-intelligence-features-in-the-ios-18-1-developer-beta.2432493/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The iOS and iPadOS 17.6 updates come two months after the debut of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-releases-ios-17-5/">iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5</a>.<br/>

iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 can be downloaded on eligible iPhones and iPads over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update. Apple has also released iOS 15.8.3 and iOS 16.7.9 security updates for devices not able to run &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There are no notable features in the iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 updates, with Apple adding unspecified bug fixes and security updates. Nothing new was discovered during the beta testing process.<br/>
<blockquote>This update provides important bug fixes and security updates and is recommended for all users.</blockquote><br/>
iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 will likely be some of the last updates that we'll see to &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 17&zwnj; aside from ongoing security fixes.

tvOS 17.6 can be downloaded using the Settings app on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>‌. Go to System > Software Update to get the new software. ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ owners who have automatic software updates activated will be upgraded to tvOS 17.6 automatically over time. <br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale, and tvOS 17.6 is no exception. There were no new features found during the beta testing process. <br/>
<br/>
Apple shares release notes for tvOS <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106336">in its tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each new version of tvOS comes out.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also released a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 17.6 software update for the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-tvos-17-6/">Apple Releases tvOS 17.6 With Bug Fixes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-tvos-17-6-with-bug-fixes.2432487/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 18.1 beta that Apple provided to developers today introduces Apple Intelligence, and it includes the feature that allows users to record and transcribe phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" alt="" width="5416" height="3047" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" /><br/>
With the update, you can tap on the record button in the top left corner after placing a call. Everyone on the call is notified that the call is being recorded through an audible message. There is no confirmation dialogue, so if a person wanted to not be recorded, they would need to hang up.<br/>
<br/>
Once the call is in progress, the audio is recorded and saved to the Notes app. Recorded phone calls can be opened from Notes, and you can re-listen to the call, view a full transcript, and get a summary from the transcript without having to re-listen to the entire thing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960200" /><br/>
Summaries are active across the operating system in iOS 18.1, and you can essentially select any text on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to get a summary of it.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence is limited to the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 developer betas at this time, and the software will be available to the public later this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-call-recording-and-transcribing/">iOS 18.1 Beta Includes Call Recording and Transcribing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-1-beta-includes-call-recording-and-transcribing.2432481/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is today providing developers with the first betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1, with the new software introducing an early version of the Apple Intelligence features. These new betas will be in testing alongside the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15 betas. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
Developers can choose whether to opt into the new betas with Apple Intelligence, or stay on the standard &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15 beta track. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> or Mac with an Apple silicon chip is required to use Apple Intelligence, and only eligible devices will see the updates. <br/>
<br/>
After updating, turning on Apple Intelligence can be done in the Settings app. There is an Apple Intelligence Waitlist that developers must opt into, but access should be granted within a few hours.<br/>
<br/>
Several Apple Intelligence features are available as of today, including Writing Tools, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>'s revamped design, the option to move between voice commands and typing to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, summaries for transcripts and other content, the new Mail categories and smart replies, smart replies in Messages, and more. <br/>
<br/>
With Writing Tools, you can rewrite, spellcheck, grammar check, and summarize text in Messages, Notes, Mail, Pages, and other apps where you write. Summaries also work for transcripts in the Notes app.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s updated design shows a glow around the edges of the screen when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is activated, and tapping at the bottom of the display allows you to type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; rather than use voice commands. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has all of Apple's product knowledge and Apple's support database, so you can ask for help, plus the personal assistant can maintain context between requests and better follow along if you stumble over your words or change your mind when speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Mail supports summaries of messages along with Smart Reply options, with Smart Reply also available for the Messages app. The Reduce Interruptions Focus mode is available to filter out unimportant notifications while surfacing notifications you need immediately, such as a ride arriving. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> supports Memories, so you can create a slideshow with natural language requests, and there's natural language for search. Search now encompasses videos so you can get right to the video segment you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Features that are not available today include Image Playground, Genmoji, ChatGPT integration, the option to erase objects in &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, Priority Notifications, and other &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities like the ability to do more in apps and on-screen awareness. New capabilities will be rolled out over time, with Apple making regular updates. <br/>
<br/>
As of right now, the Apple Intelligence features are limited to the developer beta, and it is not clear if there will be a public beta for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1. Apple plans to release Apple Intelligence in a beta capacity later this fall, and as these features are in a separate beta from the launch versions of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15, Apple Intelligence will not be available right away when the new software updates first come out in September. <br/>
<br/>
When Apple Intelligence does officially launch this fall, it will still be in beta. Developers who plan to install the new updates today should be aware that Apple Intelligence is still in the early stages of development.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence Now Available in New iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia Developer Betas</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-now-available-in-new-ios-18-1-ipados-18-1-and-macos-sequoia-developer-betas.2432474/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The second public beta comes two weeks after Apple released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-releases-ios-18-public-beta-1/">the first public beta</a>. <br/>
<br/>

Public beta testers who have <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">signed up for Apple's beta testing program</a> can download the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; updates by opening up the Settings app, going to General, tapping into the Software Update section and selecting the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; Public Beta option.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, which are AI features deeply integrated into the operating system. Not all functionality is available at this time, but it brings Writing Tools for rewriting, polishing, proofreading, and summarizing text across apps, and you can generate custom images with Image Playground. There are custom emoji available through the Genmoji feature, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is getting entirely overhauled. Note that Apple Intelligence isn't yet live in the betas. <br/>

Along with the AI features (which will be limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and M-series iPads), &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; brings a redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> with the option to rearrange app icons and widgets with open spaces, plus there's a tint option and new darker colors for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a>.<br/>

Control Center has been revamped and you can pick and choose what you want to have front and center from the new Controls Gallery. There are multiple pages so you can group related controls, and you can customize sizes. As part of this update, the Flashlight and Camera icons on the Lock Screen can be swapped out, and you can also choose Control Center options for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Action Button.<br/>

The Messages app supports scheduling texts, you can use any emoji for the Tapback feature, and you can send messages via satellite. There are text effects you can use for any word, phrase, or emoji, plus formatting like bold and italic is an option. For texts with Android users, Apple now supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>, which basically means you won't run into issues with sending images and files, plus you can see typing indicators and read receipts and send texts over Wi-Fi.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> has announced that the second season of its sci-fi show "Silo" will premiere on Friday, November 15, 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/silo-tv-show-apple-tv-plus.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-901731" /><br/>
"Silo" follows the last ten thousand people on Earth who live in a massive underground bunker to escape the toxic environment above. The inhabitants are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette, an engineer who uncovers deeper mysteries while investigating a loved one's murder. The second season will continue to explore the storylines from the first season, with new twists and revelations. <br/>
<br/>
The first season of "Silo" premiered on May 5, 2023, and production for the second season was delayed due to the 2023 Hollywood strikes. Based on the Wool trilogy by Hugh Howey, the new season will feature ten episodes, releasing weekly until January 17, 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The announcement was made at Comic-Con 2024 (via <em><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/silo-season-2-release-date-steve-zahn-1236024269/">Deadline</a></em>), where it was also revealed that Steve Zahn will join the cast. Zahn made a surprise appearance at the fan panel alongside creator and showrunner Graham Yost, author and executive producer Hugh Howey, executive producer Rebecca Ferguson, and star Common. In addition to Zahn, the returning cast includes Tim Robbins, Harriet Walter, Chinaza Uche, Avi Nash, Alexandria Riley, Shane McCrae, Remmie Milner, Clare Perkins, Billy Postlethwaite, Rick Gomez, Caitlin Zoz, Tanya Moodie, and Iain Glen.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Luxury French fashion house Balenciaga and premium German luggage brand Rimowa have launched apps for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, expanding the headset's immersive fashion experiences.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/balenciaga-vision-pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-960173" /><br/>
Balenciaga has now introduced the first phase of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balenciaga/id6526492361">its Apple Vision Pro app</a>, designed to provide users with an immersive view of its fashion shows and collections. The app offers exclusive drone views and stereoscopic footage of Balenciaga's Spring/Summer 2025 show, which was held in Shanghai on May 30. Users can also access an interactive lookbook and past collection content, enabling them to explore Balenciaga's fashion in a virtual environment. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rimowa-explore/id6474133662">Rimowa's app for the Apple Vision Pro</a> offers an immersive and interactive experience that allows users to explore the brand's iconic suitcases in detail. The app provides high-resolution 3D models of Rimowa's products, enabling users to examine the craftsmanship and design from various angles. It also includes features like virtual try-ons, where users can see how different suitcase models look and function in a virtual space. Additionally, the app offers a virtual showroom experience, allowing users to customize their luggage with different colors and accessories, and view the changes in real time. <br/>
<br/>
Balenciaga and Rimowa's apps are part of a broader trend among luxury brands exploring the potential of the Vision Pro. Gucci, also a Kering-owned label like Balenciaga, released its own Vision Pro app in April, allowing users to access an immersive mini-documentary on creative director Sabato De Sarno and the creation of Gucci's Spring/Summer 2024 collection. Other retailers, including Mytheresa, J.Crew, and E.l.f. Cosmetics, have developed Vision Pro apps focused more on shopping than on brand storytelling.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/balenciaga-and-rimowa-launch-apps-for-vision-pro/">Balenciaga and Rimowa Launch Apps for Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/balenciaga-and-rimowa-launch-apps-for-apple-vision-pro.2432450/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has resolved the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/icloud-private-relay-experiencing-outage/">iCloud Private Relay service outage</a>, restoring full functionality for users around the world after several days of disruption.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/icloud-private-relay-outage.jpg" alt="" width="1339" height="753" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-960053" /><br/>
The recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Private Relay outage began at 02:34 AM Eastern Time on Thursday and lasted until 10:59 PM Eastern Time on Saturday. The issue disrupted web browsing for some users for over 48 hours, which is an unusually long period for an Apple service outage. The problem was confirmed by Apple through its <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/">System Status webpage</a>, where it noted that the service might have been slow or unavailable. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay is a feature available to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ subscribers, designed to enhance privacy by encrypting browsing data and routing it through two separate relay servers. One of these servers is operated by Apple, while the other is managed by a third party. This setup ensures that neither Apple, internet service providers, nor the websites visited can access users' true browsing information. The service's dual-relay mechanism helps maintain a high level of privacy by separating the user's IP address from their DNS queries, which further obscures the user's online activity.<br/>
<br/>
Users who had disabled &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay to mitigate browsing issues can now go ahead and re-enable the feature to continue utilizing its privacy benefits.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-fixes-icloud-private-relay/">Apple Fixes iCloud Private Relay After Extended Outage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-fixes-icloud-private-relay-after-extended-outage.2432447/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on the introduction of advertisements on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> in the United Kingdom, according to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/07/27/apple-tv-plots-uk-adverts/"><em>The Telegraph</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-TV-Plus-Feature-2-Dark-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-959287" /><br/>
Apple has apparently been in discussions with the UK's Broadcaster's Audience Research Board (BARB) to explore the necessary data collection techniques for monitoring advertising results. Currently, BARB provides viewing statistics for major UK networks including the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Sky, as well as &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; programming. These new discussions suggest that Apple is preparing to implement an ad-supported tier on its streaming service, similar to moves made by competitors such as Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video.<br/>
<br/>
While BARB already monitors viewing time for &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; content, additional techniques are required to track advertising metrics accurately. This data is vital for advertisers to assess the reach and impact of their campaigns on the platform. In addition to the UK, Apple has also reportedly held similar discussions with ratings organizations in the United States. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has already included limited advertising in its live sports events, such as last year's Major League Soccer coverage, where ads were incorporated even for Season Pass holders. It is also notable that in March Apple hired Joseph Cady, a former advertising executive from NBCUniversal, to bolster its video advertising team.<br/>
<br/>
Competitors like Netflix and Disney+ have successfully launched lower-cost, ad-supported tiers, which have helped them attract additional subscribers and increase revenue. For instance, Netflix recently reported record revenues, partly due to a 34% increase in subscribers to its ad-supported tier. The push towards an ad-supported tier comes at a time when Apple is reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/apple-tv-plus-curbs-costs/">reducing its spending on Apple TV+ content</a> after investing over &#36;20 billion in original programming. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/telegraph-co-uk/">Telegraph</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-in-talks-to-bring-ads-to-apple-tv/">Apple in Talks to Bring Ads to Apple TV+</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-in-talks-to-bring-ads-to-apple-tv.2432445/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has reached a provisional agreement with its first unionized retail store in Towson, Maryland, marking a significant development in the company's labor relations (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-27/apple-reaches-labor-contract-deal-in-maryland-union-says"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/apple-townson-apples-website.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1612" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-859475" /><br/>
Apple has agreed to a tentative collective bargaining agreement with retail employees at its Towson store, the first of its kind for the company's operations in the United States. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM CORE) <a href="https://www.goiam.org/news/iam-core-first-u-s-unionized-apple-retail-store-workers-reach-historic-tentative-labor-agreement-with-tech-giant/">announced the deal</a> on Friday, detailing improvements in pay, work-life balance, and job security. This agreement is now pending a vote by the store's approximately 85 employees on August 6.<br/>
<br/>
The proposed three-year contract includes an average pay raise of 10%, with increases in starting pay for 80% of job classifications. The agreement aims to improve work-life balance through enhanced scheduling protections for both full-time and part-time employees. The deal also includes limits on the use of contracted employees, a new transparency and accountability procedure for disciplinary action, and an updated severance clause to provide financial protection in the event of layoffs. The tentative agreement maintains all current benefits and includes a commitment to negotiate any future additions. <br/>
<br/>
The Towson Apple store made headlines in June 2022 when its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/18/apple-store-officially-joins-union/">employees voted to join IAM</a>, becoming the first Apple retail store in the United States to unionize. Since then, IAM CORE has been in negotiations with Apple management, with discussions starting in January 2023. Frustration over the slow pace of negotiations led to a strike authorization vote in May 2024. The Towson store agreement may set a precedent for labor negotiations at other Apple retail locations and could potentially influence unionization efforts across the company's 271 U.S. stores. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-states/">United States</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-finalizes-first-retail-union-contract/">Apple Finalizes First Retail Union Contract With Maryland Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-finalizes-first-retail-union-contract-with-maryland-store.2432440/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is set to expand its manufacturing footprint in India by producing high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> "Pro" models in the country for the first time, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/apple-to-make-iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-models-in-india-this-year-sources-article-12779508.html"><em>MoneyControl</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Update-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-953750" /><br/>
Apple started &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; production in India in 2017 with the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>. Since then, it has progressively increased its manufacturing activities in the country, assembling models such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>. The production of these models in India, however, began several months after their global launch. This changed with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, which were manufactured and available in India from day one of their global release.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the company apparently plans to produce the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max in the country later this year. The production of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will be managed by Apple's long-standing partner, Foxconn, at its Sriperumbudur facility in Tamil Nadu. The facility will soon begin the New Product Introduction (NPI) process, with mass production slated to begin once the devices launch.<br/>
<br/>
The move is part of Apple's broader strategy to diversify its supply chain away from China and enhance its manufacturing capabilities in India. The company reportedly aims to manufacture a quarter of all its iPhones in India over the next few years, up from the current 14%. The Indian government has been actively encouraging such investments, offering incentives to attract major manufacturers. Apple is investing heavily in production to meet the anticipated high demand for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, planning to produce 90 million units in 2024, a 10% increase from last year's &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, it was reported that Apple is also eyeing plans to begin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/26/apple-cuts-iphone-prices-in-india/">manufacturing the iPad in India</a> for the first time. Likewise, the company is rumored to have plans to start <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/16/foxconn-wins-airpods-order-india/">manufacturing AirPods in India</a> starting later this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-to-manufacture-pro-iphone-models-in-india/">Apple to Manufacture &#039;Pro&#039; iPhone Models in India for the First Time</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-manufacture-pro-iphone-models-in-india-for-the-first-time.2432439/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Intelligence will miss its initial expected launch date to give Apple more time to fix bugs, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-28/apple-intelligence-to-miss-initial-release-of-upcoming-ios-18-ipados-overhauls"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
According to individuals with knowledge about Apple's plans, the company now plans to start rolling out Apple Intelligence in software updates by October, arriving several weeks after the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>. This means that Apple Intelligence will now effectively be split out of the initial launch of the new software updates. The reason for the delay is said to be concern about the stability of Apple Intelligence features and need for developers to have sufficient testing time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence will still be made available to software developers for the first time as soon as next week with the first betas of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, which would be extremely unusual as the company does not normally release previews of follow-up software updates until the first version has been released.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman notes that the new release strategy for Apple Intelligence means that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup will likely launch without Apple Intelligence features and require a software update to obtain them at a later date. The company is now said to be aiming to have development of iOS 18.0 completed by the end of July.<br/>
<br/>
Even when Apple Intelligence arrives with iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1, it will be missing aspects such as the overhauled version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that uses on-device data to answer questions and understands what is on a user's screen. These features are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/new-siri-experience-to-debut-spring-2025/">expected to arrive in the first half of 2025</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/28/report-apple-intelligence-delayed-to-ios-18-1/">Report: Apple Intelligence Delayed to iOS 18.1 in October</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-intelligence-delayed-to-ios-18-1-in-october.2432417/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>WhatsApp Reaches 100 Million Monthly Users in the United States</title>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp this week reached a significant milestone of 100 million monthly active users in the United States, a market traditionally dominated by other messaging services such as SMS and iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
The achievement, announced in an <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/100-million-using-whatsapp-across-the-united-states">official blog post</a>, indicates a potential shift in the American messaging landscape, where WhatsApp has steadily gained ground despite the longstanding popularity of Apple's iMessage. The Meta-owned messaging app is extremely popular in Europe owing to its cross-platform compatibility.<br/>
<br/>
In recent years Meta invested heavily in U.S. marketing campaigns, including high-visibility ad placements in Times Square and television spots emphasizing privacy and end-to-end encryption. A recent campaign featured the cast of the TV show "Modern Family" highlighting WhatsApp's cross-platform capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
The milestone of 100 million users is particularly impressive given the competition from iMessage, which has been the preferred messaging service for many <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users due to its default, seamless integration with Apple's ecosystem. However, WhatsApp's ability to offer a unified messaging experience across different devices apparently resonates with a significant portion of the American population, especially in major cities like Los Angeles, New York, Miami, and Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp's milestone comes at a time when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s messaging landscape is poised for further changes. Apple is set to introduce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">Rich Communication Services (RCS)</a> in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> later this year, a move that should significantly enhance the functionality of messages sent between iPhones and Android devices. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a> offers features like high-quality media sharing, read receipts, and typing indicators, which could potentially reduce the need for third-party apps like WhatsApp for advanced messaging capabilities. However, it is notable that &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; does not offer end-to-end encryption – a key WhatsApp feature.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-states/">United States</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/28/whatsapp-reaches-100-million-monthly-us-users/">WhatsApp Reaches 100 Million Monthly Users in the United States</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-reaches-100-million-monthly-users-in-the-united-states.2432410/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
