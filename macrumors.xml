		<description><![CDATA[Safari will gain a series of AI-powered features and UI enhancements in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/04/30/apple-to-unveil-ai-enabled-safari-browser-alongside-new-operating-systems"><em>AppleInsider</em> reports</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/safari-icon-blue-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833485" /><br/>
Safari will apparently receive a range of visual tweaks alongside several new tools to improve the browsing experience, including:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>An "Intelligent Search" browser assistant tool that leverages Apple's on-device AI technology to identify key topics and phrases on webpages for summarization purposes.</li><br/>
<li>A "Web Eraser" tool that allows users to remove unwanted portions of webpages easily. Erasure is persistent, remaining even when revisiting a site unless changes are reverted. </li><br/>
<li>A new, quick-access menu emerging from the address bar that consolidates page tools, bringing over some functions that currently sit in the Share Sheet and placing them alongside the new tools.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The iPadOS and macOS versions of Safari are also expected to align further. These new features are purportedly undergoing evaluation alongside internal builds of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a> ahead of their unveiling at Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC) in June. Earlier this month, backend code on Apple's servers suggested that a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-18-safari-browsing-assistant-rumor/">Safari browsing assistant</a> is in the works, corroborating this report.<br/>
<br/>
Farther in the future, Apple is said to be working on a more powerful version of Visual Look Up that allows users to obtain information on products when browsing through images. The feature is expected to be released sometime in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ios-18-notes-mail-photos-fitness-rumors/">"overhaul" many of Apple's built-in apps</a>, including Notes, Mail, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, and Fitness. Apple's next-generation operating systems are almost certain to be previewed during Apple's WWDC keynote on June 10, and the updates should be widely released in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/appleinsider-com/">AppleInsider</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">New AI Features Reportedly Coming to Safari in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ai-features-reportedly-coming-to-safari-in-ios-18.2425199/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today kicked off numerous discounts across multiple Apple products and accessories, the highlight being the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;179.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. You'll also find deals on the Apple Pencil 2, AirTags, and Studio Display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895410" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
For the AirPods Pro 2, this is a match of the all-time low price on the earbuds, and one of the only times so far in 2024 that we've tracked this discount. Fast delivery options have a May 2 delivery estimate, while free delivery will arrive around May 5 for most residences in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;69 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;179.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Secondly, Amazon has the Apple Pencil 2 for the record low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00. The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the iPad mini (6th generation), iPad Air (4th generation and later), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd generation and later), and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st generation and later).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-pencil-2-april.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948664" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Pencil 2 for &#36;79.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Moving to AirTags, Amazon has the 1-Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0933BVK6T%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;24.00</strong></a> and the 4-Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932QJ2JZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a>. These are both solid second-best prices on each AirTag model, and similar to the AirPods Pro deal, you won't need to clip any coupons to see these discounts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/airtag-april.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948663" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0933BVK6T%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;5 OFF</div>AirTag (1-Pack) for &#36;24.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932QJ2JZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;19 OFF</div>AirTag (4-Pack) for &#36;79.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Finally, we're tracking a pair of deals on the Apple Studio Display on Amazon. The Standard Glass model has hit <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,299.97</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.00, which is an all-time low price. The Nano-texture Glass model is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HP4KL%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,599.97</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,899.00, which is a second-best price. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Both models come with the tilt-adjustable stand, but you can also find markdowns on the tilt- and height-adjustable stand. There are currently no deals on the VESA mount adapter models on Amazon.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today said it is working on a fix for an iPhone software bug that has resulted in some alarms in the Clock app failing to play a sound at the set time for some users recently, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/EmilieIkedaNBC/status/1785280005922075047"><em>NBC</em>'s Emilie Ikeda</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1785309196562382969"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern</a>.<br/>

The issue was highlighted by the TODAY Show on NBC this morning after gaining traction on social media platforms like TikTok. It is unclear how many iPhone users have experienced this issue, but not everyone is affected. While some TikTok users allege that the iPhone's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102216">Attention Aware feature</a> has contributed to the problem, Apple did not reveal a specific cause.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-4-launch/">new Beats Solo 4 headphones</a>, Apple's Beats brand is announcing an all-new entry-level model of earbuds, <a href="https://www.beatsbydre.com/earbuds/solo-buds">Beats Solo Buds</a>. Priced at &#36;79.99 and shipping in June, Beats Solo Buds deliver 18 hours of battery life and come in the smallest case ever designed for Beats earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948605" /><br/>
Beats Solo Buds feature a custom-built acoustic architecture and an ergonomic design with four ear tip size options for a precise fit. There is no active noise cancelation on the Beats Solo Buds, but they do offer passive noise isolation to improve audio quality. A custom microphone design paired with an advanced noise-learning algorithm help deliver improved call quality.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPcyYxVWlT4?si=CrcWwY3Sa51VKEYS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
When it comes to battery life, Beats Solo Buds offer up to 18 hours of playback right in the buds themselves without needing to recharge, which is easily the longest battery life for any Beats earbud product.<br/>
<br/>
But when their batteries do run out, you'll need to find a power source, as the charging case does not include any additional battery storage onboard for recharging directly from the case. That not only helps keep costs down, but also allows for the tiny case that slips easily into a pocket and is 40% smaller than the case for Beats Studio Buds +.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-black-pocket.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948607" /><br/>
With up to 18 hours of battery life in the buds, most users will be able to go multiple days without needing to recharge Beats Solo Buds at all. When that time comes, however, all they have to do is to connect a power source to the USB-C port on the case, and that power source can even be an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>. A Fast Fuel feature provides an hour of playback time with just five minutes of charging.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-gray-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948606" /><br/>
As with most other recent Beats headphones and earphones, Solo Buds include a custom Beats chip platform that allows for tight integration across both iOS and Android with one-touch pairing, automatic setup across devices, and support for Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> and Android's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Device services. The Beats 'b" buttons on the buds can be configured for a variety of functions, including music and phone call controls, voice assistant activation, and volume control.<br/>
<br/>

Beats Solo Buds will begin shipping in June and will be available in four colors: Matte Black, Storm Gray, Arctic Purple, and Transparent Red. With the introduction of Solo Buds, Beats will be discontinuing the standard Beats Studio Buds but will be retaining the more advanced Beats Studio Buds +. The Beats earbud lineup will also continue to include the Beats Fit Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a>, so there will be a full range of truly wireless earphone options to suit all types of users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">Beats Solo Buds Launching in June With 18-Hour Battery Life and a Tiny Case for &#36;79.99</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-solo-buds-launching-in-june-with-18-hour-battery-life-and-a-tiny-case-for-79-99.2425192/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Beats brand today is announcing an update to its most popular line of headphones with the new <a href="https://www.beatsbydre.com/headphones/solo4-wireless">Beats Solo 4</a>. The on-ear headphones have been re-engineered inside and out to deliver upgraded performance and fit while featuring even longer battery life compared to the previous generation.<br/>

On the acoustic front, Beats Solo 4 feature custom-built 40 mm transducers specifically tuned for music and designed to minimize artifacts and distortion, and the on Apple devices the headphones support Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking to immerse you in your audio environment while keeping the sound source anchored to your device as you move around.<br/>
<br/>
Upgraded digital beam-forming microphones and an intelligent noise-learning algorithm trained in over 7,000 hours of exposure to real-world environments help deliver excellent call quality and voice assistant performance.<br/>

Beats Solo 4 support three different modes of connection: wirelessly over Bluetooth, wired over USB-C, and wired over a 3.5mm audio connector. Most users will likely opt for wireless connectivity for convenience, but connecting over USB-C offers support for lossless audio and the ability to charge the headphones while listening, while the 3.5mm jack offers a simple connection method for battery-free listening.<br/>
<br/>
If you're connecting wirelessly, Beats Solo 4 will deliver up to 50 hours of playback, up from 40 hours in the previous generation, while you can take up to 36 hours of phone calls on a single charge. A 10-minute Fast Fuel charge will give you up to five hours of playback time if you're low on battery.<br/>

Active noise cancelation (ANC) is not included on Beats Solo 4, but the on-ear design offers fairly solid passive noise isolation in our testing, keeping even rather loud environmental sounds from intruding much on our listening experience.<br/>
<br/>
Beats Solo 4 include a proprietary Beats chip platform to support both iOS and Android with one-touch pairing, automatic setup across devices, and support for Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> and Android's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Device services. iOS users also get access to always-on "Hey <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>" functionality and support for Audio Sharing. The iconic Beats 'b" button on the ear cups can be configured for music and phone call controls and voice assistant activation, while volume can be controlled by pressing above or below the "b" button.<br/>
<br/>

Overall, Beats Solo 4 retain the same iconic design that has led to over 40 million units sold since the introduction of the original Beats Solo headphones in 2009. Offering a more compact form factor and a cheaper price point than the over-ear Beats Studio Pro, Beats Solo 4 weigh just 217 grams while delivering a comfortable fit thanks to durable UltraPlush ear cushions, infinite-rotation gimbals on the ergonomically angled ear cups, and a flex-grip headband with customizable sliders. We did notice a bit of ear fatigue due to the on-ear design, but adjusting the headphones slightly definitely helped extend our listening session with out too much discomfort.<br/>

The case design is essentially the same as that for the Beats Studio Pro, which may not appeal to all users. It's a compact nylon case with a low-profile carrying/attachment loop and a side zipper, and the interior features a main compartment for the headphones and two small pockets for the included USB-C to USB-C and 3.5mm to 3.5mm cables. As with the slightly larger Studio Pro case, it can be a bit difficult to get the headphones in and out of the case.<br/>
<br/>
Beats Solo 4 come in Matte Black, Slate Blue, and Cloud Pink color options and are available to order starting today from apple.com for &#36;199.99 ahead of a May 2 shipping date.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-4-launch/">Beats Solo 4 Headphones Debut With Improved Acoustics, Longer Battery Life, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-solo-4-headphones-debut-with-improved-acoustics-longer-battery-life-and-more.2425191/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For the upcoming iPhone 16, Apple will adopt the same color-infused back glass that features on the standard iPhone 15 models, claims a new rumor out of China.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Perspective.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935161" /><br/>
Last year, Apple debuted a custom dual-ion exchange glass process on the non-premium iPhone 15 models that gives the rear glass layer a frosted effect that contrasts with the main frame color.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's description of the effect on the iPhone 15: <br/>
<blockquote>"For the first time in a smartphone, colour is infused throughout the back glass, creating five beautiful colours. The back glass is strengthened with an optimised dual-ion exchange process before being polished with nanocrystalline particles and etched to create a luxurious, textured matte finish."</blockquote>According to the Weibo-based leaker "Fixed focus digital," who <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/Oc5UGclf7">claims to have seen the iPhone 16 color scheme</a>, Apple will use the same process for the back glass on the new models, which could come in as many as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/iphone-16-plus-rumored-to-come-in-these-7-colors/">seven colors this year</a> as opposed to five.<br/>

Late last month, <a href="https://weibo.com/6315816381/5017601013189904">another Weibo source</a> suggested Apple could extend its dual-ion exchange glass process to the back of the iPhone 16 Pro, which is expected to have the same titanium frame as the iPhone 15 Pro. However, the source of today's leak does not mention the premium iPhone 16 models, and both Weibo accounts have yet to establish a track record for accurate Apple rumors.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has poached dozens of artificial intelligence experts from Google and created a "secretive European laboratory" in Zurich to house a new team of staff tasked with building new AI models and products, according to a paywalled <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/87054a60-dc4d-4238-a4b9-93ab48f22f56">Financial Times</a></em> report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947754" /><br/>
Based on an analysis of LinkedIn profiles conducted by <em>FT</em>, Apple has recruited at least 36 specialists from Google since 2018, when it poached John Giannandrea to be its top AI executive.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's main AI team works out of California and Seattle, but the company has recently expanded offices dedicated to AI work in Zurich, Switzerland. Apple's acquisition of local AI startups <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/11/24/apple-faceshift-acquisition-confirmed/">FaceShift</a> (VR) and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/07/apple-acquisition-visual-search-startup-fashwell/">Fashwell</a> (image recognition) is believed to have influenced its decision to build a secretive research lab known as "Vision Lab" in the city.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report, employees based in the lab have been involved in Apple's research into the underlying technology that powers OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot and similar products based on large language models (LLMs). The focus has been on designing more advanced AI models that incorporate text and visual inputs to produce responses to queries.<br/>
<br/>
The report suggests that Apple's recent work on LLMs is a natural outgrowth of the company's work on Siri over the last decade:<br/>
<blockquote>The company has long been aware of the potential of "neural networks" — a form of AI inspired by the way neurons interact in the human brain and a technology that underpins breakthrough products such as ChatGPT.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck Wooters, an expert in conversational AI and LLMs who joined Apple in December 2013 and worked on Siri for almost two years, said: "During the time that I was there, one of the pushes that was happening in the Siri group was to move to a neural architecture for speech recognition. Even back then, before large language models took off, they were huge advocates of neural networks."</blockquote>Currently, Apple's leading AI group includes notable ex-Google personnel such as Giannandrea, former head of Google Brain, which is now part of DeepMind. Samy Bengio, now senior director of AI and ML research at Apple, was also previously a leading AI scientist at Google. The same goes for Ruoming Pang, who directs Apple's "Foundation Models" team focusing on large language models. Pang previously headed AI speech recognition research at Google.<br/>
<br/>
In 2016, Apple acquired Perceptual Machines, a company that worked on generative AI-powered image, detection, founded by Ruslan Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University. Salakhutdinov is said to be a key figure in the history of neural networks, and studied at the University of Toronto under the "godfather" of the technology, Geoffrey Hinton, who left Google last year citing concerns about the dangers of generative AI. <br/>
<br/>
Salakhutdinov told <em>FT</em> that one reason for Apple's slow AI rollout was the tendency of language models to provide incorrect or problematic answers: "I think they are just being a little bit more cautious because they can't release something they can't fully control," he said.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, and other apps. These features are expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-working-on-on-device-llm/">powered by Apple's on-device LLM</a>, although Apple is also said to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/">discussed partnerships</a> with Google, OpenAI, and Baidu.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With Apple soon to be required to bring the same EU changes that it made on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> today confirmed that it will release Fortnite for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite_apple_featured.jpg" alt="" width="2140" height="1204" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-754674" /><br/>
&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; is already working to release an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; version of Fortnite in the EU, with the game set to be available from the forthcoming &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store, an alternative app marketplace. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; version of Fortnite is coming "soon," and an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; version will follow "this year."<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/eu-says-ipados-digital-gatekeeper-dma/">said this morning</a> that iPadOS, the operating system designed to run on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, is considered a digital gatekeeper under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). As a result, Apple has six months to comply with the requirements set by the DMA, and we've already seen those requirements implemented on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, the European Commission said that iPads will also need to comply with the Digital Markets Act &#x1f64c;<br><br>We’re moving full steam ahead to bring Fortnite and the <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EpicGames</a> Store to iPhones in the EU soon and iPads this year! &#x1f389; <a href="https://t.co/MHh6EGVinC">https://t.co/MHh6EGVinC</a></p>&mdash; Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1784978618344456484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
As of iOS 17.4, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in the European Union can download apps from alternative app marketplaces rather than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, and starting in iOS 17.5, apps are available directly from developer websites. Right now, only &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps can be downloaded outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, but Apple will need to expand this functionality to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as well.<br/>
<br/>
Within six months, EU users will be able to download &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps from alternative app marketplaces and from websites. As with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; updates, the upcoming changes are limited to the European Union, and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app ecosystem will function as is in the rest of the world.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortnite/">Fortnite</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/fortnite-coming-to-ipad-eu/">Epic Games to Bring Fortnite to iPad in EU After iPadOS &#039;Gatekeeper&#039; Decision</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-to-bring-fortnite-to-ipad-in-eu-after-ipados-gatekeeper-decision.2425163/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) today announced [<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402213A1.pdf">PDF</a>] that it has fined AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint/T-Mobile &#36;196 million collectively for illegally selling access to customer location information without consent.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/3-4-24-iPhone-Case-Refresh-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939420" /><br/>
Sprint and T-Mobile (now merged into T-Mobile) have been fined &#36;12 million and &#36;80 million, respectively. Verizon has been fined almost &#36;47 million, and AT&T has been fined more than &#36;57 million.<br/>
<br/>
The FCC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/01/fcc-questions-us-carriers-location-data/">first began investigating</a> the four major U.S. carriers in 2019 after they were found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/us-cell-carriers-still-selling-your-location-data/">selling real-time location information</a> from customer devices to third-party data aggregators, which led to that location data being sold a second time to private investigators, bounty hunters, law enforcement agencies, credit card companies, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Following the investigation, the FCC confirmed that wireless carriers had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/31/fcc-carriers-illegal-location-data-sharing/">violated federal law</a> by sharing consumer location data. Fines were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/28/fcc-us-carriers-customer-location-data-fines/">proposed back in 2020</a>, but carriers were given an opportunity to provide evidence and legal arguments against the decision before the fines were formally imposed.<br/>
<br/>
The fines vary based on the length of time that each carrier sold access to customer location information without safeguards, and the number of entities that were provided access. The FCC determined that carriers were obligated to protect the personal information of their customers, which they did not do.<br/>
<blockquote>"Our communications providers have access to some of the most sensitive information about us. These carriers failed to protect the information entrusted to them. Here, we are talking about some of the most sensitive data in their possession: customers' real-time location information, revealing where they go and who they are," said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. "As we resolve these cases - which were first proposed by the last Administration - the Commission remains committed to holding all carriers accountable and making sure they fulfill their obligations to their customers as stewards of this most private data."</blockquote><br/>
The four carriers had different practices, but each carrier relied on contract-based assurances that the data aggregators purchasing the real-time location information would get consent from customers before accessing their location, which did not happen. Even after learning that data was being misused in this way, the FCC says the carriers "continued to sell access to location information without taking reasonable measures to protect it from unauthorized access."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fcc/">FCC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/att/">AT&amp;T</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/verizon/">Verizon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/fcc-fines-carriers-customer-data-sharing/">FCC Fines AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon Almost &#36;200 Million for Illegally Sharing Customer Location Data</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fcc-fines-at-t-t-mobile-and-verizon-almost-200-million-for-illegally-sharing-customer-location-data.2425162/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began informing early <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> customers that their physical titanium cards are set to expire this summer, with replacements to be sent in the near future. Customers who signed up for the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; in August 2019, when the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; launched, will be receiving the notice.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-card-expiration.jpg" alt="" width="1403" height="789" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948571" /><br/>
It appears that the physical &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; is designed to last for five years before a replacement is sent out. Most of the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;'s functionality is digital, with options for rotating security codes and credit card numbers for online purchases, but there is a number associated with the physical card that's used for in-person transactions. Credit card companies add expiration dates to physical cards for fraud prevention purposes, to introduce new technology, and more.<br/>
<br/>
From Apple's email:<br/>
<blockquote>We're sending a replacement titanium card to your billing address so you can continue to use it at physical locations. Remember, even without a physical card you can always use your Apple Card at any location that accepts Apple Pay. Your new titanium card will be shipped within 2 weeks from the date of this communication.<br/>
<br/>
You can continue to use your titanium card until it expires or you activate the new one. You can still use Apple Card with Apple Pay and your virtual card number to shop at merchants that don't yet accept Apple Pay by typing in your number from Wallet or using Safari AutoFill.</blockquote><br/>
Replacement cards will include a prepaid shipping label so that customers can send in their old &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; to be recycled. Apple recommends that &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users who receive a new card activate it when it arrives, as the current card is scheduled to stop working at its expiration date.<br/>

Customers who signed up for &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; at some point after it first launched will likely receive emails at the five year mark. Note that some customers have been receiving emails for the last month or so, but these may be customers who were able to sign up for the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; early as part of a beta test.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/first-physical-apple-cards-expiring-soon/">First Physical Apple Cards Expiring Soon, Apple Shipping Out Replacements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-physical-apple-cards-expiring-soon-apple-shipping-out-replacements.2425155/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models will feature "by far the best OLED tablet panels on the market," <a href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/blog/apple-to-announce-oled-ipads-on-may-7th-lgd-and-12-9-dominating-on-sdcs-challenges">according to Display Supply Chain Consultants</a>. Set to be announced on May 7, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models will feature LTPO (a more power efficient form of OLED), a 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate, and a tandem stack and glass thinning that will bring "ultra-thin and light displays" that support high brightness, extended battery life, and a long lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
As has been previously rumored, today's report suggests that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be available in 12.9-inch and 11.1-inch sizes, with both options to feature slimmed down bezels and a much thinner design. The 12.9-inch version, for example, will be over 1mm thinner than the current model.<br/>
<br/>
There is a possibility that the 11.1-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will be in short supply at launch because Apple has been dealing with light leakage issues that are not impacting the 12.9-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the best OLED display on the market, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models could get Apple's next-generation AI-optimized M4 chip, and they are expected to ship alongside a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> and an updated version of the Magic Keyboard. Apple will also introduce new 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch LCD <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to unveil the updated iPads on Tuesday, May 7 at 7:00 a.m. Pacific Time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/ipad-pro-best-oled-panels/">Apple to Use &#039;Best OLED Panels on the Market&#039; for Upcoming iPad Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-use-best-oled-panels-on-the-market-for-upcoming-ipad-pro.2425145/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A new British cybersecurity law mandates smart device manufacturers like Apple to enhance protections or face hefty penalties.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-series-store.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913490" /><br/>
The legislation, known as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-laws-to-protect-consumers-from-cyber-criminals-come-into-force-in-the-uk">Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure (PSTI) Act</a>, introduces robust requirements aimed at securing devices connected to the internet to make it harder for cybercriminals to get access to private networks.<br/>
<br/>
The law specifically targets the inadequacies in current security measures by mandating three major changes: the elimination of default passwords, a clear protocol for reporting security vulnerabilities, and detailed consumer information on the length of product support and software updates. These stipulations apply to all companies manufacturing or selling smart devices in the UK.<br/>
<br/>
For Apple, the law will necessitate a review of how its products comply with these enhanced standards. While Apple devices do not use default passwords, the company will need to ensure that all of its connected devices sold in the UK clearly communicate the duration of security support to customers. In addition, affected companies are expected to establish or refine their contact points for security issue reporting. <br/>
<br/>
Retailers such as Apple stores are also required to provide customers with point-of-sale information about the cybersecurity practices relevant to the devices they purchase. The PSTI Act also includes strict penalties for non-compliance, with fines that can reach up to £10 million (&#36;12.5 million USD) or 4% of the offending company's global turnover. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/apple-faces-new-uk-cybersecurity-law/">Apple Faces New Cybersecurity Law in UK</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-faces-new-cybersecurity-law-in-uk.2425138/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the best looks yet at the rear design and increased size of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models was today shared online. <br/>
<br/>

The images, <a href="https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1784540264872423518">posted on X</a> by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonny-dickson/">Sonny Dickson</a>, show four dummy models representing the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max. These units are designed to take the place of real devices for display or testing purposes.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/dlxXgpXV8U">pic.twitter.com/dlxXgpXV8U</a></p>&mdash; Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) <a href="https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/1784928575386468633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
The dummy models provide a clear look at the slightly larger size of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max, which are expected increase from 6.1- to 6.3-inches and 6.7- to 6.9-inches, and how they compare to the other models in the lineup.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to stay at 6.1- and 6.7-inches like their predecessors, but they are rumored to receive a redesigned vertical camera array designed to accommodate spatial video capture. Starting with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, Apple's two non-Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models have had diagonally arranged dual rear cameras. The entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is expected to launch as usual in the fall.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Game emulator <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta</a> has made a splash on iPhone following Apple's recently announced App Store support for retro game emulators, and now the developer Riley Testut has confirmed that Delta is almost ready for its iPad debut.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DV9QFZltxDI?si=tfliOh7JKOmD1Jyc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/C6RxU_rOLeP">post</a> shared on Threads over the weekend, Testut said the iPad version is "near completion," with just controller skins to finish and some bug fixes to iron out.<br/>
<br/>
Testut explained that Delta for iPad had not originally been a development priority because the plan was to limit the emulator's launch to the EU via alternative app marketplace AltStore PAL, which doesn't support iPad.<br/>
<br/>
However, in a reversal of a years-old policy, Apple earlier this month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">announced</a> that it would allow retro game emulators on the ‌App Store‌. Delta was therefore made available on the App Store as a <a href="http://<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/">free download</a> in the United States and other countries on April 17, with users supporting the developer via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane">Patreon</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Delta has been hugely popular since its debut on the App Store and the emulator has been a constant presence in the Top Charts, with users flocking to play retro games that originally appeared on NES, SNES, N64, Nintendo DS, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance.<br/>

Delta works with popular game controllers, and supports cheats, save states, backups, syncing, and more. Other features include an option to fast forward, a "hold" button for games where a button needs to be consistently held, support for Haptic Touch, and box art for imported games. Local multiplayer gaming is available on iPhone, and up to four players can participate. A future version of Delta will also include SEGA Genesis support, according to Testut. <br/>
<br/>
iPad support will arrive when Delta 1.6 hits the App Store, but <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane?utm_source=search">Patreon supporters</a> don't have to wait and can grab Delta 1.6 now. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/delta-game-emulator-coming-to-ipad/">Popular Delta Retro Game Emulator Coming to iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/popular-delta-retro-game-emulator-coming-to-ipad.2425122/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[EU antitrust officials on Monday identified iPadOS, Apple's operating system for iPads, as a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2363">significant digital gatekeeper</a> under the EU's new tech regulations, which carry strict requirements that aim to promote fair competition and expand options for consumers. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">Last September</a>, the Commission designated Apple as a gatekeeper for its iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> operating system, its web browser Safari, and its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. On the same day, the Commission opened a market investigation to assess whether iPadOS constitutes an important gateway for business users to reach end users in order to assess whether should be designated as a gatekeeper.  <br/>
<br/>
That investigation has now ended. According to an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2363">EC press release</a> shared on Monday, the Commission's investigation found that Apple "presents the features of a gatekeeper in relation to iPadOS," for the following reasons:<br/>
<blockquote><ul><li>Apple's business user numbers exceeded the quantitative threshold elevenfold, while its end user numbers were close to the threshold and are predicted to rise in the near future.</li><br/>
<li>End users are locked-in to iPadOS. Apple leverages its large ecosystem to disincentivise end users from switching to other operating systems for tablets.</li><br/>
<li>Business users are locked-in to iPadOS because of its large and commercially attractive user base, and its importance for certain use cases, such as gaming apps.</li></ul></blockquote>The Commission has now given Apple a six-month deadline to fully comply with the obligations set by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which means we should expect enforced changes in iOS like alternative app marketplaces, web distribution, and alternative browsers to come to iPadOS as well in a forthcoming update.<br/>
<blockquote>"The Digital Markets Act is a dynamic tool which allows us to tackle the realities of digital markets," said Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy. "Today, we have brought Apple's iPadOS within the scope of the DMA obligations. Our market investigation showed that despite not meeting the thresholds, iPadOS constitutes an important gateway on which many companies rely to reach their customers. Today's decision will ensure that fairness and contestability are preserved also on this platform, in addition to the 22 other services we designated last September. Apple has six months to make iPadOS compliant with the DMA."</blockquote>To be classified as a "gatekeeper" under the DMA, a company must fulfill certain criteria, including having sales across the EU of at least €7.5 billion, or a market capitalization of €75 billion or above. The designation also requires platforms or services to have more than 45 million monthly active users and over 10,000 active business users annually within the EU.<br/>
<br/>
Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft were all designated gatekeepers by the Commission, and had to fully comply with all DMA obligations by March 7. <br/>
<br/>
Companies that do not adhere to the new regulations risk facing EU investigations, substantial fines, and the imposition of "behavioral or structural remedies." The fines can amount to 10 percent of a company's global revenue, with a 20 percent penalty for repeat violations.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/eu-says-ipados-digital-gatekeeper-dma/">iPadOS Identified as Digital &#039;Gatekeeper&#039; Under New EU Tech Rules</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-identified-as-digital-gatekeeper-under-new-eu-tech-rules.2425116/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple does not plan to launch a second-generation version of its Vision Pro headset until the end of 2026, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-vision-pro-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944159" /><br/>
Writing in the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-28/apple-rivals-retool-to-compete-with-iphone-and-vision-pro-ios-18-and-ai-details-lvjhucsv">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman said Apple's latest Vision Pro roadmap "doesn't currently call for a second-generation model until the end of 2026." In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/gurman-apple-vision-pro-2-at-least-18-months-away/">February 2024</a>, he said that the device was "at least 18 months away."<br/>
<br/>
According to Gurman's sources, Apple is still trying to figure out a way to bring a cheaper version to market before then, although the company remains "flummoxed" by how exactly to bring down the cost.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-vision-pro-major-upgrades-unlikely-until-2027/">February</a> said he believes new Vision Pro models with significant changes to the specification may not enter mass production until 2027.<br/>
<br/>
At the time, Kuo said he did expect a modified Vision Pro to enter mass production in late 2025 to early 2026, with Apple focused on improving costs and production. However, this leads him to believe that the "user experience will not differ from the current model." Indeed, it is even possible that these changes will not be announced to the public, beyond a potential price cut.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release the Vision Pro in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/">additional countries</a> before WWDC in June, with reports that the device could be coming to China <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-vision-pro-launch-china-may/">as soon as next month</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/no-apple-vision-pro-2-before-end-of-2026/">Gurman: No Apple Vision Pro 2 Launch Planned Before End of 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-apple-vision-pro-2-launch-planned-before-end-of-2026.2425113/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple is accepting pre-orders through its online stores in the three countries from today, with the speakers shipping and going on sale in Apple's regional retail stores on May 10.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; was initially released by Apple in October 2020 across the U.S. and a handful of other countries. Since launch, the speaker has not seen significant hardware revisions, though Apple did introduce new colors in November 2021 and activated the devices' temperature and humidity sensors via software updates last year. The introduction of the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; in two more countries makes the prospect of a second-generation model being released anytime soon pretty unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021, Apple phased out the original full-size &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, but it launched a second-generation version in January. This new &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; retains a design similar to its predecessor but includes an enlarged backlit touch interface and several other enhancements. Both the new &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; are Siri-based smart speakers, and come with Matter compatibility and support for stereo pairing.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thailand/">Thailand</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/malaysia/">Malaysia</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/homepod-lineup-launching-malaysia-thailand-may-10/">HomePod and HomePod Mini Launch in Malaysia, Thailand, and Turkey on May 10</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-and-homepod-mini-launch-in-malaysia-thailand-and-turkey-on-may-10.2425112/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This weekend we're tracking a pair of AirPods deals at Amazon, including savings on the AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro 2. The cheapest model starts at just <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;89.00</strong></a> for the AirPods 2, down from their original price of &#36;129.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-2-Discount-Feature-Red-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895365" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C are available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. Although this is another second-best price on the earbuds, it's one of the most consistent deals we've tracked in 2024 and just a &#36;9 difference compared to that record low price. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;40 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for &#36;89.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Both of these earbuds have an estimated delivery date around May 3, and they represent solid second-best prices on each model. There are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset.  <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-28/apple-rivals-retool-to-compete-with-iphone-and-vision-pro-ios-18-and-ai-details-lvjhucsv"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today said</a> that iOS 18 will "overhaul" many of Apple's built-in apps, including Notes, Mail, Photos, and Fitness.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-General-Notes-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946875" /><br/>
Gurman did not reveal any specific new features planned for these apps. It was previously rumored that the Notes app will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/ios-18-notes-app-voice-memos-math-rumors/">gain support for  displaying more math equations, and a built-in option to record voice memos</a>, but this is the first time we have heard about updates planned for the Mail, Photos, and Fitness apps.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman also corroborated our exclusive <em>MacRumors</em> report last week about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/calculator-app-for-ipad-rumor/">Apple finally planning a Calculator app for iPadOS 18</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A recap of iOS 18 rumors:<br/>
<br/>
<ol><li><strong>Smarter Siri:</strong> iOS 18 is rumored to include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, and more. These features are expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-working-on-on-device-llm/">powered by Apple's on-device large language model (LLM)</a>, but Apple has reportedly also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/">discussed partnerships with companies like Google, OpenAI, and Baidu</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>More Customizable Home Screen:</strong> One of the design changes rumored for iOS 18 is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-more-customizable-home-screen-rumor/">more customizable Home Screen</a>, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-home-screen-app-icon-customization/">ability to place app icons anywhere on the Home Screen grid</a>. This change will allow for blank spaces, rows, and columns between app icons.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Improved Texting With Android Users:</strong> Apple announced that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">will support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS in the Messages app</a> on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature. Compared to SMS, RCS support will improve the texting experience between iOS and Android devices by allowing for higher-resolution photos and videos, audio messages, typing indicators, read receipts, Wi-Fi messaging, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Calculator Revamp:</strong> iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15 are expected to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/macos-15-revamped-calculator-app/">revamped Calculator app with several new features</a>, including a sidebar that lists recent calculations, an improved interface for converting units, integration with the Notes app, and more. Yes, this means that Apple will finally be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/calculator-app-for-ipad-rumor/">making its Calculator app available on the iPad</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Math in Notes App:</strong> With iOS 18, the Notes app is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/ios-18-notes-app-voice-memos-math-rumors/">gain support for displaying mathematical notation</a>, allowing users to include more types of algebraic equations and formulas in notes.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Custom Routes in Apple Maps:</strong> At least two new Apple Maps features are expected on iOS 18, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-maps-custom-routes-ios-18/">custom routes</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/">topographic maps</a>. Custom routes would allow users to choose specific roads to travel on while navigating, while topographic maps include details such as trails, contour lines, elevation, and points of interest for hiking and other outdoor uses. Apple already introduced topographic maps on the Apple Watch with watchOS 10.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Safari Browsing Assistant:</strong> Another new generative AI feature potentially coming with iOS 18 is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-18-safari-browsing-assistant-rumor/">browsing assistant in Safari</a>, but no specific details are known yet. There are already multiple iPhone web browsers with AI tools, such as Microsoft Edge and its GPT-4-powered Copilot, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/arc-search-iphone-app-ai/">Arc Search</a>, which can summarize web pages to provide concise information.</li><br/>
<li><strong>AirPods Pro as Hearing Aid:</strong> iOS 18 will reportedly include a so-called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/airpods-pro-to-gain-hearing-aid-mode-ios-18/">"hearing aid mode" for AirPods Pro</a>, but it is unclear how it would differ from Apple's existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-conversation-boost-airpods-pro/">Conversation Boost feature</a> that launched in 2021.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Next-Generation CarPlay:</strong> Apple's website says the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/">first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay will arrive in 2024</a>, so the platform might debut alongside iOS 18 later this year. However, it is possible that next-generation CarPlay will also be compatible with some iOS 17 versions.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Freeform Scenes:</strong> iOS 18 is rumored to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/ios-18-macos-15-freeform-app-scenes/">add a new "Scenes" option to Apple's drawing app Freeform</a>. This feature would allow users to select specific sections or "scenes" on the canvas for easier navigation.</li></ol>For additional rumors and expectations, read our comprehensive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18 roundup</a>, which we routinely update with the latest information.<br/>
