		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">introduced the iPhone 16e</a>, its newest entry-level smartphone. The device succeeds the third-generation iPhone SE, which has now been discontinued.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Apple-Newsroom.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990787" /><br/>
The iPhone 16e features a larger 6.1-inch OLED display, up from a 4.7-inch LCD on the iPhone SE. The display has a notch for Face ID, and this means that Apple no longer sells any iPhones with a Touch ID fingerprint button, marking the end of an era.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 16e is powered by an A18 chip, enabling support for Apple Intelligence features, such as notification summaries and Genmoji for creating custom emoji.<br/>
<br/>
The device is also equipped with an Apple-designed 5G modem, whereas other iPhones have a Qualcomm modem. Apple says its own modem is so power efficient that the iPhone 16e offers the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone model ever.<br/>
<br/>
On the back of the iPhone 16e is a single 48-megapixel Fusion camera, which provides a 2x "optical-quality" Telephoto option, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Other key features include an Action button instead of a Ring/Silent switch, along with a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. The device does not have the Camera Control button that was introduced across the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup last year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is accepting orders for the iPhone 16e starting February 21. In the U.S., pricing starts at &#36;599.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">Apple Announces iPhone 16e With A18 Chip and Apple Intelligence, Pricing Starts at &#36;599</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-iphone-16e-with-a18-chip-and-apple-intelligence-pricing-starts-at-599.2449702/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's online store has gone down ahead of today's expected iPhone 16E announcement.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-Launch-Store-Down.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990779" /><br/>
The store is currently showing a "be right back" splash page. "We're making updates to the Apple Store," it says. Check back soon."<br/>
<br/>
In the Apple Store app, there is a "watch the event" link, suggesting that the announcement will be accompanied by a video.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/">"newest member of the family" would be announced today</a>. That likely refers to the iPhone 16E, set to replace the iPhone SE.<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned for in-depth coverage of Apple's announcement.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-store-down-iphone-16e/">Apple Store is Down Ahead of Expected iPhone 16E Announcement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-is-down-ahead-of-expected-iphone-16e-announcement.2449697/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp is retesting a recently nixed setting that lets users choose whether the app automatically clears the unread message count badge on its Home Screen icon after every launch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
<em><a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-ios-25-3-10-76-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a></em> reports that the feature is controlled by a new toggle in WhatsApp's iOS notification settings, called "Clear Badge." The setting carries the description: "Your home screen badge clears completely after every time you open the app." <br/>
<br/>
The option, which is already available in WhatsApp for Android, should serve to reduce clutter on the user's Home Screen, and potentially lessen "unread anxiety." <em>WABetaInfo</em> notes that the feature may have already appeared for some users in the past few weeks, including those on the stable release from the App Store. However, for reasons that remain unclear, WhatsApp decided to disable them shortly after their initial release. <br/>
<br/>
The feature is currently making its way through beta testing again via TestFlight, so expect it to roll out to all WhatsApp users in the coming days.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/whatsapp-testing-clear-badge-unread-messages/">WhatsApp Re-Testing &#039;Clear Badge&#039; Feature for Unread Messages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-re-testing-clear-badge-feature-for-unread-messages.2449684/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Gemini AI Features No Longer Available in Google iOS App</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Google is removing its Gemini AI model from the Google app on iOS. The company announced the change in an email to Gemini users on February 18, according to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-is-no-longer-available-in-the-google-app-for-ios"><em>AndroidCentral</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/google-gemini.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941761" /><br/>
"We're making some changes to create an even better Gemini experience on iOS," the email read. "Gemini is now available as its own app, and that's now the best place to use Gemini. To continue using Gemini, download the new Gemini app from the App Store."<br/>
<br/>
The change makes sense, since the standalone <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/google-gemini/id6477489729">Gemini app</a> already offered enhanced functionality compared to the limited integration within the Google app. It allows iPhone users to interact with Google's AI through text or voice queries and includes support for Gemini Extensions. <br/>
<br/>
A key feature is Gemini Live, which wasn't available in the previous Google app implementation. When engaged in a conversation, Gemini Live appears in both the Dynamic Island and Lock Screen, letting you control your AI interactions without returning to the main app.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/google-gemini/id6477489729">Gemini app is free to download</a> on the App Store, and Google offers premium features through Gemini Advanced subscriptions available as in-app purchases. Gemini Advanced is part of a Google One AI premium plan costing &#36;18.99 per month. Apart from Gemini in Mail, Docs, and more, it includes access to Google's next-generation model, 1.5 Pro, priority access to new features, and a one million token context window. Users need to sign in with a Google account to access the service.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/gemini-no-longer-available-in-google-ios-app/">Gemini AI Features No Longer Available in Google iOS App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gemini-ai-features-no-longer-available-in-google-ios-app.2449683/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 17 Pro: Apple Has &#039;Tested&#039; Wireless Reverse Charging Feature</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has reportedly tested a wireless reverse charging feature for its upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models that would make the iPhone capable of delivering power to other Apple devices, according to the Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Pf13JjHYa">Instant Digital</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-17-pro-asherdipps.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990412" /><br/>
The Chinese leaker claims that Apple is testing a 7.5W wireless charging feature for iPhone 17 Pro models, and it could be used to charge other Apple accessories like AirPods, Apple Watch, or potentially an upcoming MagSafe Battery Pack.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/01/two-way-wireless-charging-2019-iphones/">Long-running rumors</a> of iPhone reverse wireless charging capabilities finally came to fruition in 2021 – albeit in a limited way – when Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-reverse-charging/">MagSafe Battery Pack</a> for iPhone 12 and newer models. When attached to an ‌iPhone‌ that was charging via Lightning, the ‌iPhone‌ could deliver power to the MagSafe Battery Pack, which was the first instance of an ‌iPhone‌ being able to route power to an accessory device. <br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">discontinued</a> the MagSafe Battery Pack in September 2023 with the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup, which dropped the Lightning cable in favor of USB-C. iPhone 15 and later models can reverse charge Apple Watch, AirPods, and other smaller devices that support Power Delivery at up to 4.5 watts via the USB-C port, but the wireless reverse charging feature for Apple devices has not been implemented since the discontinuation of the MagSafe Battery Pack.<br/>
<br/>
In 2022, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/">predicted</a> that a relaunched MagSafe Battery Pack would eventually transition to USB-C, but that has yet to happen. Likewise, In September 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman also said he <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/will-there-be-a-usb-c-magsafe-battery-pack/">expected</a> USB-C versions of the MagSafe Battery Pack to return "eventually." But he qualified that by saying "Don't hold your breath." <br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital today admitted that while Apple is testing the reverse wireless charging feature for the iPhone 17 Pro models, the leaker does not know if the feature will actually be enabled on the devices when they officially launch. Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup around mid-September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-17-pro-reverse-charging-feature/">iPhone 17 Pro: Apple Has &#039;Tested&#039; Wireless Reverse Charging Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-apple-has-tested-wireless-reverse-charging-feature.2449682/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The company confirmed the upcoming closure today in a statement, but it has yet to provide a closing date for the location.<br/>

Apple Northbrook opened in 2005, and the store moved to a larger space in the mall in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
Apple confirmed that affected employees will continue to work for the company.<br/>
<br/>
"At Apple, we're always focused on providing an exceptional experience for all of our customers," said Apple. "With the evolving redevelopment plans at Northbrook Court Mall and the departure of several retailers, we have made the difficult decision to close our store there. We've loved serving the Northbrook community for nearly 20 years, and our valued team members will continue their roles at Apple. We look forward welcoming customers at one of our eight Chicagoland locations, as well as on Apple.com and the Apple Store app."<br/>
<br/>
The news was first reported <a href="https://www.chicagobusiness.com/commercial-real-estate/apple-inc-closing-northbrook-court-store">by <em>Crain's Chicago Business</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
Northbrook Court is considered to be a dying mall, as it has lost several major retailers over the past few years, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/north-suburban-mall-sees-one-of-its-few-remaining-stores-close-for-good/3654495/">including Lululemon last month</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apples-infinite-loop-store-closing-next-month/">permanently closed its Infinite Loop and Royal Hawaiian stores</a> early last year, but it has also opened several new stores around the world since then, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/apple-previews-miami-worldcenter-store/">at the Miami Worldcenter</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/apple-to-open-first-retail-store-in-malaysia/">The Exchange TRX in Malaysia</a>, and elsewhere. Apple also announced that it will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/apple-store-downtown-detroit-coming-soon/">soon be opening a store in Downtown Detroit</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/apple-store-in-chicago-area-closing/">Apple Store Permanently Closing at Struggling Mall in Chicago Area</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-permanently-closing-at-struggling-mall-in-chicago-area.2449670/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Humane today informed customers that it is discontinuing its &#36;700 Ai Pin at the end of February, with the device set to be taken offline less than a year after it launched in April 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922090" /><br/>
The Ai Pin will work until 12:00 p.m. Pacific Time on February 28, which is just 10 days from now. At that point, Ai Pin features like calling, messaging, AI queries and responses, and cloud access will stop being available. Humane recommends that Ai Pin users sync their devices over Wi-Fi to download stored pictures, videos, and notes before February 28 because data will be deleted after that.<br/>
<br/>
The sudden discontinuation of the Ai Pin comes as Humane is being <a href="https://humane.com/media/humane-hp">sold to HP</a> for &#36;116 million. HP is purchasing Humane's CosmOS AI platform and more than 300 patents and patent applications, plus HP will be hiring Humane's employees.<br/>
<br/>
Humane does not plan to provide the majority of customers with a refund, even though the Ai Pin worked for under 12 months. Refunds are only available to customers who are within their 90-day return period. Customers who purchased an Ai Pin on or after November 15, 2024 will get a refund, but other users are out the full &#36;700. Note that all refunds must be submitted by February 27.<br/>
<br/>
Humane recommends that customers recycle their Ai Pin through an e-waste recycling program, as no online features will remain functional and it will only be able to provide offline information like battery level.<br/>
<br/>
Additional information about the Ai Pin's discontinuation is <a href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34243204841997-Ai-Pin-Consumers-FAQ">available on the Humane website</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/humane-ai-pin-discontinued/">Humane&#039;s &#36;700 Ai Pin Discontinued and Defunct After Less Than 1 Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/humanes-700-ai-pin-discontinued-and-defunct-after-less-than-1-year.2449669/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/">announce a new entry-level iPhone model tomorrow</a>, and it is increasingly likely that the device will be named iPhone 16E.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-16e-rumor-roundup-header.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990657" /><br/>
Most rumors have referred to the device as a new iPhone SE, since it will succeed the iPhone SE (3rd generation), but there is mounting evidence that the device will be named iPhone 16E instead of iPhone SE (4th generation).<br/>
<br/>
As a refresher, the iPhone 16E name was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/01/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-be-named-iphone-16e/">first mentioned in December</a> by Fixed Focus Digital, an account with more than two million followers on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Later that month, a leaker known as Majin Bu on X also cited a source who claimed that the next iPhone SE will actually be named iPhone 16E.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1891857914849116175">follow-up post</a> today, Majin Bu cited a source who has apparently seen an iPhone box with the name iPhone 16E on it. In addition, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1890070028013432999">believes</a> that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/">Apple CEO Tim Cook's teaser post</a> about a "new member of the family" being announced this Wednesday suggests that the device will indeed have a new name. And last, there are <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Diphone%2B16e">several Amazon listings</a> for so-called iPhone 16E cases, although that could be guesswork.<br/>
<br/>

The device is rumored to feature a larger 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an A18 chip, a USB-C port, Apple Intelligence support, an Apple-designed 5G modem, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users in the European Union now have access to another alternative app store with the <a href="https://en.aptoide.com/ios">official launch of Aptoide</a>, a gaming marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apptoide.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990584" /><br/>
Aptoide has been around for quite some time as an app marketplace on Android devices, but the company began working on an iOS marketplace when Apple added support for sideloading apps last year. The marketplace has been in testing in a beta capacity since June 2024, but it is now available to all EU users.<blockquote>"This full launch marks a major milestone in game distribution on iOS and Aptoide's commitment to an open and unrestricted app distribution ecosystem. Apple users now have access to newfound freedoms, but there's a huge amount of work still to be done to continue opening up iOS globally and reduce friction for users, and game developers."</blockquote>Aptoide is a free alternative app store that's available on iPhones and iPads for those who are located in the European Union. It is unique among app marketplaces because it adds support for App Versions, so users are able to install and play older versions of iOS games.<br/>
<br/>
The option to install older versions of games is useful on older iPhones that can't run newer software updates, or for those who simply prefer an older version of a game. Apptoide's game selection can be <a href="https://en.aptoide.com/ios">found on the Aptoide website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/apptoide-alternative-app-store/">Aptoide Alternative App Store Launches in the EU With Access to Older Versions of Games</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/aptoide-alternative-app-store-launches-in-the-eu-with-access-to-older-versions-of-games.2449650/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Those hoping for significantly faster wired charging speeds with the iPhone 17 lineup this year might be disappointed, if the latest rumor is true.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-17-Pro-Render-Front-Page-Tech.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990064" /><em>A render of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-camera-design-leak/">iPhone 17 Pro's alleged camera design</a></em></div><br/>
In a note with investment firm GF Securities, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> this week, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all support up to 35W wired charging speeds.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, <em>ChargerLAB</em> found that the iPhone 16 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/iphone-16-pro-max-charging-test/">achieved maximum sustained charging speeds of around 30W</a>. In one image, the website showed the iPhone 16 Pro Max reaching a peak charging speed of 37W with Apple's 140W USB-C power adapter, but it is unclear how long the device kept charging at that speed.<br/>
<br/>
<em>PhoneArena</em> saw similar results with the standard iPhone 16. In its review last year, it said that device reached a peak charging speed of 38W when it was "under extremely heavy loads such as benchmark testing or playing games." The website said the iPhone 16 achieved a sustained charging speed of closer to 20W.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, with the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models already reaching peak wired charging speeds in the 35W range, it sounds like there will be no significant improvement to wired charging speeds with any of the iPhone 17 models.<br/>
<br/>
Pu did not reveal wireless MagSafe charging speeds for any iPhone 17 models. iPhone 16 models can charge <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-25w-magsafe-charging/">at up to 25W with MagSafe</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-lineup-35w-charging-rumor/">iPhone 17 Lineup Rumored to Support Up to 35W Charging Speeds</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-lineup-rumored-to-support-up-to-35w-charging-speeds.2449643/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 17 Pro Models Rumored to Feature Aluminum Frame Instead of Titanium Frame</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the years, Apple has switched from an aluminum frame to a stainless steel frame to a titanium frame for its highest-end iPhones. And now, it has been rumored that Apple will go back to using aluminum for three out of four iPhone 17 models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-17-pro-asherdipps.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990412" /><br/>
In an investor note with research firm GF Securities, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> this week, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with aluminum frames. Interestingly, though, he expects Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model to have a titanium frame.<br/>
<br/>
This would be a notable change for the Pro models, as all of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have titanium frames, resulting in the devices weighing less than iPhone 14 Pro models with heavier stainless steel frames.<br/>
<br/>
Aluminum frames were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/">already rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro models</a> once before.<br/>
<br/>
Pu said Apple plans to use aluminum for the iPhone 17 Pro models due to environmental considerations. Aluminum generally has a lower carbon footprint compared to titanium, and Apple is aiming to achieve carbon neutrality for all of its products and supply chain <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/apple-supply-chain-renewable-energy-progress/">by 2030</a>. Following in the footsteps <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-unveils-its-first-carbon-neutral-products/">of the Apple Watch</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-m4-mac-mini-carbon-neutral/">latest Mac mini</a>, perhaps some iPhone 17 models will be advertised as Apple's first carbon-neutral iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear why the iPhone 17 Air would have a titanium frame, as aluminum is lighter than titanium, which would be fitting for the device's thin and light design. We may have a partial explanation, though. Last year, fellow Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air's frame would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">use a mix of titanium and aluminum</a>, with a lower amount of titanium compared to the iPhone 15 Pro models. Apple surely has its reasons here, so hopefully we will find out more details before the iPhone 17 series is unveiled in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-pro-models-aluminum-frame-rumor/">iPhone 17 Pro Models Rumored to Feature Aluminum Frame Instead of Titanium Frame</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-models-rumored-to-feature-aluminum-frame-instead-of-titanium-frame.2449641/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expected to announce the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> as soon as tomorrow, potentially with improved long-term value retention, according to analysis by <a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/iphone-se-4-depreciation-report/">SellCell</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-SE-4-Single-Camera-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-978494" /><br/>
Despite its lower price point, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; has historically struggled with resale value compared to Apple's higher end smartphones. According to SellCell's depreciation analysis, previous SE models have seen significantly faster value loss than standard iPhones. The third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; lost 42.6% of its value within the first month and 57.8% after six months, compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, which saw a decline of 28.8% in the first month and 27.8% after six months.<br/>
<br/>
A similar pattern was seen with the second-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, which experienced a 50.8% drop in value within six months, whereas the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> series saw a 31.1% decrease over the same period. This is likely due to the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;'s lower starting price, use of older designs, and lower overall demand in the second-hand market.<br/>
<br/>
However, it is worth noting that some smaller and lower-cost iPhones have managed to retain their value more effectively. For example, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 13 mini held its value significantly better than the SE models. The device lost only 19.2% of its value in the first month, compared to 42.6% for the third-generation SE, and after 12 months, it had depreciated by 46.1%, compared to 64.4% for the third-generation SE. Even at 24 months, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 mini had lost just 53% of its original value, positioning it closer to flagship models than to SE devices.<br/>
<br/>
As the new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is expected to adopt a more modern design with significantly upgraded specifications, it could potentially alter the depreciation trend that has defined previous &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; models. The shift to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14-style design could improve long-term demand, and if Apple equips it with a considerably more high-end chipset and camera system as expected, as well as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support, it may retain value more effectively than its predecessors because it will remain competitive in the lineup for longer.<br/>
<br/>
Like other devices, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; sees continued depreciation following the launch of a successor. The second-generation SE saw an additional 4% drop in value within 12 weeks of the third-generation SE's release. They tend to see accelerated depreciation after their initial launch window, meaning those looking to upgrade should do so quickly after launch to maximize resale value.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing will also be a key factor in determining the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;'s long-term value retention. Reports suggest the device may start at up to &#36;499 in the United States, marking a slight increase from the current model's &#36;429 price. While this could keep the new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; a compelling option for budget-conscious customers, it also raises expectations for hardware improvements that justify the price increase.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to delay the launch of the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; beyond its usual two-year upgrade cycle has also created a larger gap in its lineup, leaving fewer affordable options with up-to-date hardware. This may result in increased demand for the new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; when it launches, particularly if it offers substantial upgrades over previous models as expected.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/">SellCell</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-se-4-could-change-resale-market/">iPhone SE 4&#039;s Specs Could Lead to Enhanced Resale Value</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4s-specs-could-lead-to-enhanced-resale-value.2449640/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apps that have not complied with the trader requirement in the European Union have been removed from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6agg0lja">informed developers today</a>. The apps that have been removed will not be allowed back in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; until trader status is provided and verified by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961762" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/app-store-trader-requirement-dsa.jpg" alt="" width="1538" height="865" /><br/>
Disclosing trader status is a requirement of the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the EU. Developers who distribute apps in the European Union need to share information with customers that includes address, phone number, and email address, with that data listed in the EU &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/17/developers-eu-app-store-trader-requirements/">warned developers several times</a> that apps without verified trader status would be removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; on February 17, 2025, and that has now happened. Apple has required new apps and app updates to include trader information for quite some time now, so most apps should have been updated. Trader status information can be added through &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect.<br/>
<br/>
The DSA requires Apple to verify and display contact details for all "traders" who are distributing apps on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in the European Union. Developers who make money from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; through an upfront purchase price or through in-app purchases are considered traders, regardless of size.<br/>
<br/>
Independent developers and small companies may not have dedicated business addresses and phone numbers to provide to customers, so some developers have been unhappy with the EU's requirement. Developer contact information will be displayed on the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌ product page when an app is distributed in any of the 27 territories in the EU.<br/>
<br/>
More information on determining who is a trader and who needs to provide contact details can be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-compliance-information/manage-european-union-digital-services-act-trader-requirements/">found on Apple's website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/european-union-trader-status-deadline/">Apps That Didn&#039;t Add &#039;Trader&#039; Contact Info in the EU Removed From App Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apps-that-didnt-add-trader-contact-info-in-the-eu-removed-from-app-store.2449636/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nomad today announced the launch of an updated version of its <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/chargekey-v2">ChargeKey portable charger</a>, with the new model gaining support for 240W charging and 10Gb/s data transfer speeds.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/nomad-chargekey.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990284" /><br/>
The USB-C to USB-C ChargeKey can fast charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, Android device, and more at up to 240W. The prior version of the ChargeKey was limited to 60W charging speeds and USB 2.0 data transfer speeds, so the new model offers notable improvements for MacBook users and those who need a portable cable for data transfers.<br/>
<br/>
Like the previous ChargeKey, the 240W model has a braided nylon cable with electroplated zinc cable housings. It's compact and small enough to fit on a keychain, and the two cable tips attach to one another magnetically when not in use.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad is selling the ChargeKey for &#36;25, and it is <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/chargekey-v2">available from the Nomad website</a> starting today.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nomad/">Nomad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/nomad-240w-chargekey/">Nomad Launches New 240W ChargeKey USB-C Cable</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nomad-launches-new-240w-chargekey-usb-c-cable.2449621/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a few iPad discounts on Amazon, including low prices on the M2 iPad Air and M4 iPad Pro. These deals include multiple all-time low prices on Apple's tablets, matching the prices we tracked over the holiday season in many cases.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M2 iPad Air</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/ipad-air-green.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987499" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Amazon has nearly every model of Apple's M2 iPad Air on sale this week at &#36;100 off, all of which are matching the record low prices for each tablet. You'll also find Best Buy matching these discounts, and you don't need to be a My Best Buy Plus/Total member to get the deals.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J5VFYQ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>128GB Wi-Fi 11-inch iPad Air for &#36;499.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Delivery estimates have slipped into March for many of these iPad Air models on Amazon. In general, you'll get better estimates from Best Buy for these tablets, and you'll find those matching deals below as well.<br/>

<br/>
Similar to the iPad Air tablets, both Amazon and Best Buy are providing record low prices on Apple's M4 iPad Pro this week. For the 11-inch models, on Amazon you'll need to clip an on-page coupon to see the final sale price, and on Best Buy you'll need to be a My Best Buy Plus/Total member. <br/>
<br/>
The same stipulations don't apply to 13-inch models, which are available without coupons or the need of a membership. Every price listed below is the match of an all-time low price on each iPad Pro model.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Most long-time macOS users will be aware of the Application Switcher. It's invoked using the <strong>Command+Tab</strong> keyboard shortcut, and lists all of the apps currently running on your Mac, enabling you to quickly switch between them. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/macos-app-switcher.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990495" /><br/>
In this article, we'll run through the Mac App Switcher's most basic functions, and then highlight some of our favorite lesser-known App Switcher tricks that you're bound to find useful once you're familiar with it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Basic Functions of the App Switcher</h2><br/>
When you hold <strong>Command</strong> and press <strong>Tab</strong>, the App Switcher overlay appears above all other open windows on your desktop, and remains visible until you release the Command key. Letting go switches you to the last active app, prior to the one you were just using. As you might expect, repeating this action switches you back to the previous active app (you'll see the order change in the row of apps).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/app-switcher-changes.jpg" alt="app switcher" width="2530" height="790" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990507" /><br/>
Repeatedly tapping <strong>Tab</strong> with the Command key held down cycles you through the list of apps in the App Switcher from left to right, while releasing Command takes you to the selected app. If you continue to hold down Command and press the <strong>Tilde (~)</strong>, the selection moves from right to left.<br/>
<br/>
You can also press the <strong>right and left arrow keys</strong> to move the selection box forwards and backwards. A two-finger drag on a trackpad does the same thing, or you can use your mouse cursor to highlight an app in the list and then click to select it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bring Back a Minimized App</h2><br/>
While the App Switcher allows you to cycle through open apps, selecting an app with minimized windows doesn't automatically restore those windows. To do that, activate the App Switcher and navigate through the row of icons. With the desired app highlighted, press and hold the <strong>Option</strong> key, then release the Command key. This action should restore the minimized window of the app in question.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Show All Windows and Select Between Them</h2><br/>
If you press the <strong>up or down arrow keys</strong> with an icon highlighted in the App Switcher overlay, Exposé will be activated for the selected app, which causes all of its windows to be displayed on screen. (Pressing the <strong>1</strong> key achieves the same result.) Note: Unless you have multiple displays, this won't work if the app is in fullscreen mode.<br/>
<br/>

Open windows are shown front and center, while minimized windows (assuming you are not using Stage Manager) appear along the bottom of the Dock. You can use the arrow keys to switch between them and press <strong>Enter</strong> to open the one you want, or simply select one using your mouse cursor in the usual way.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Drag and Drop Files</h2><br/>
An oft-overlooked function of the App Switcher is its ability to open files. Simply begin to drag a file from a Finder window, then invoke the App Switcher and drag the file onto the relevant app icon in the overlay. Let go of the file and it should open in the selected app. <br/>
<br/>

<h2>Close and Hide Apps Via the App Switcher</h2><br/>
Pressing the <strong>H</strong> key in the App Switcher hides all the windows of the selected app (pressing the H key again reveals them). Try cycling through the overlay with the Tab key and tap H as you go – it's a neat way to quickly clear a space on a desktop cluttered with windows. This method streamlines window management by avoiding minimization. By invoking the App Switcher again you can switch back to the hidden app. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, highlighting an icon in the App Switcher and tapping <strong>Q</strong> has to be one of the fastest ways to individually quit open Mac apps, and probably qualifies as our favorite App Switcher trick.

		<description><![CDATA[The rear cameras on iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to be housed in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-camera-design-leak/">new rectangular bar with rounded corners</a>. A similar design change has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/iphone-17-air-front-page-tech-renders/">also been rumored for the iPhone 17 Air</a>, but the lowest-end iPhone 17 might miss out.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-teal.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964610" /><em>The standard iPhone 16</em></div><br/>
According <a href="https://x.com/jon_prosser/status/1891676271270047932">to Jon Prosser</a>, who runs YouTube channel Front Page Tech, the standard iPhone 17 will have the same overall design as the standard iPhone 16.<br/>
<br/>
If so, the iPhone 17 would have two vertically-aligned rear cameras in a pill-shaped bump.<br/>
<br/>
This means the standard iPhone 17 would be the most unchanged new model launching this year, in terms of appearances. However, customers who are not fans of the new camera bar might be relieved to know that a more familiar design might remain available for at least one more year. Apple should unveil the iPhone 17 series in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-same-design-as-iphone-16-rumor/">iPhone 17 Said to Miss Out on iPhone 17 Pro&#039;s Rumored Camera Bar</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-said-to-miss-out-on-iphone-17-pros-rumored-camera-bar.2449614/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Major League Soccer returns for its 30th season this coming weekend, with all 30 clubs set to take the field on Saturday and Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-TV-MLS-Jersey-Patches.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990476" /><br/>
To celebrate the league's 30th season, Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/major-league-soccer-kicks-off-30th-season-this-weekend-on-mls-season-pass/">announced</a> that the left sleeve of every MLS club's jersey will feature a bespoke Apple TV patch throughout the season. There are 30 custom Apple TV jersey patches in total, with each inspired by the given club's "distinctive crest, color palette, and visual identity," according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what the new Apple TV jersey patch looks like for Inter Miami CF:<br/>

<em>TechRadar</em>'s Jacob Krol today <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apples-celebrating-the-2025-mls-season-kicking-off-with-a-custom-logo-for-each-and-every-team">shared more details</a> about the jersey patches. He also spoke with Apple's global head of sports marketing, Emeka Ofodile. <br/>
<br/>
MLS jerseys already had an Apple TV patch for the past few seasons, but the logo previously had a generic design in white or black.<br/>
<br/>

2025 marks the third year of a 10-year Apple-MLS partnership. In the Apple TV app, you can subscribe to MLS Season Pass to watch all regular season and playoff matches. In the U.S., MLS Season Pass is priced at &#36;14.99 per month, or &#36;99 for the full season. Apple TV+ subscribers can subscribe for &#36;12.99 per month, or &#36;79 per season. <br/>
<br/>
New this season, Apple TV+ subscribers can watch a featured MLS match every Sunday evening, even if they do not subscribe to MLS Season Pass. The inaugural Sunday Night Soccer matchup will see the league's newest franchise, San Diego FC, make its debut against the reigning MLS champions LA Galaxy, on Sunday at 7 p.m. Eastern Time.<br/>
