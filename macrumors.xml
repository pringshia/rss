		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/">today released o3-mini</a>, a new, more cost efficient model that's available for both ChatGPT and the OpenAI API starting today. OpenAI previewed o3-mini in December, but it is ready at a time when OpenAI is aiming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-ai-app-top-app-store-ios/">keep up with Chinese company DeepSeek</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/open-ai-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1093" height="615" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953560" /><br/>
According to OpenAI, o3-mini "advances the boundaries" of what's possible with smaller, more efficient models. o3-mini is designed for STEM capabilities, and OpenAI says that it has particular strength in science, math, and coding. o3-mini is search capable, and it can locate up-to-date answers with links to relevant web sources.<br/>
<br/>
o3-mini is OpenAI's first small reasoning model that supports features like function calling, Structured Outputs, and developer messages. There are three reasoning effort options, including low, medium, and high, to optimize for different use cases that prioritize processing power for complex challenges or speed.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI is keeping o1 as its standard general knowledge reasoning model, but o3-mini is available for technical domains that require precision and speed. When used with ChatGPT, o3-mini uses medium reasoning effort for a balance between speed and accuracy, but o3-mini high is an option in the model picker.<br/>
<br/>
ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users are able to use o3-mini starting today, and it will replace o1-mini in the model picker. The rate limit for Plus and Team users is now 150 messages per day, up from 50.<br/>
<br/>
o3-mini is the first reasoning model that OpenAI is making available to free users. Those with the free plan can try o3-mini by selecting the "Reason" option in the message composer.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/openai-o3-mini-launch/">OpenAI Launches o3-mini, a Cost-Efficient Reasoning Model Rivaling DeepSeek</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-launches-o3-mini-a-cost-efficient-reasoning-model-rivaling-deepseek.2448525/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is no longer developing augmented reality glasses designed to pair with the Mac, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/apple-scraps-work-on-mac-connected-augmented-reality-glasses">Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple wanted to create smart glasses that looked like regular glasses, but had augmented reality capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-777634" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/Apple-Glasses-Purple-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple was developing AR glasses that connect to a Mac for power, because a chip powerful enough for AR applications <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/apple-ar-glasses-still-at-least-four-years-away/">would not fit</a> in a device that's the size of standard glasses. Apple engineers determined that the AR glasses would need to provide the performance of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a tenth of the power consumption, otherwise the chip would simply run too hot. Adding a battery to the glasses would also be problematic because of the weight.<br/>
<br/>
At first, Apple wanted the glasses to connect to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; didn't have the power or battery life to support them. Apple then transitioned to using the Mac as a power source, but Apple executives weren't convinced a Mac-connected device was a good solution, leading to the shutdown of the project.<br/>
<br/>
The AR glasses that Apple worked on were lighter than the Vision Pro and did not require a head strap, nor was there a front-facing screen showing the wearer's eyes. Apple reportedly created lenses that could change tint based on what the wearer was doing, such as doing work, as a signal to people around them.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors about Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/14/apple-ar-smart-glasses-in-development/">work on AR glasses</a> for almost 10 years now, and the Vision Pro headset is what Apple built because the technology doesn't yet exist for the kind of augmented reality glasses that Apple is aiming for.<br/>
<br/>
Back in 2023, Gurman said that the AR glasses were a running joke on the AR/VR team because it was a "hopeless" device they worked on to keep Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> happy. Back in 2017, Cook himself said that the technology to make AR smart glasses "in a quality way" simply didn't exist, and it appears that's still the case.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple's work on augmented reality glasses has been paused, the company is still developing new versions of the Vision Pro, and when the technology exists, Apple executives want to revisit the possibility of a set of AR glasses.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's smart glasses featured projectors able to display information like images and video to the wearer, and Apple is continuing to work on custom microLED displays that could one day be used in AR glasses.<br/>
<br/>
Apple competitor Meta has already demonstrated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/25/meta-augmented-reality-glasses/">"Orion" augmented reality glasses</a> that are in development, but the glasses are in a prototyping stage and cost over &#36;10,000 to make. Meta is aiming to release the glasses by 2027, which is also when Apple was originally planning to debut its now-canceled smart glasses.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-glasses/">Apple Glasses</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/apple-cancels-mac-connected-ar-glasses/">Apple Cancels Mac-Connected AR Smart Glasses</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-cancels-mac-connected-ar-smart-glasses.2448510/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple wants to defend its multi-billion dollar search engine deal with Google, which is in danger because Google has been found guilty of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/google-search-antitrust-monopoly/">violating antitrust law</a>. Apple has asked the court handling Google's lawsuit with the U.S. government for an emergency stay [<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1158.0_1.pdf">PDF</a>], so that Apple has time to intervene and plead its case before a remedy is decided on.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837104" /><br/>
The U.S. Department of Justice sued Google for anti-competitve behavior in the search market <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/20/google-antitrust-lawsuit-us-government/">way back in 2020</a>, and after a lengthy legal battle, the DoJ won. A main component of the lawsuit was Google's deal with Apple, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/google-default-search-engine-safari-20-billion/">sees Google pay billions annually</a> to be the default search engine for Safari. The court decided that the agreement between Apple and Google violated antitrust law, and is a major reason Google has been able to maintain its search engine monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. government asked the court to bar Google from entering into contracts with Apple, among other restrictions, and that will cost Apple a lot of money. In 2022, for example, Google paid Apple &#36;20 billion. Apple already asked the court to allow it to be more involved in the case as remedies are decided on, and the court denied the request due to timing. Apple appealed the decision, and is asking for a stay while the appeal plays out.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that because its deal with Google is at stake, it deserves a right to participate, and without a stay, it will "suffer clear and substantial irreparable harm."<br/>
<blockquote>Apple will be unable to participate in discovery and develop evidence in the targeted fashion it has proposed as this litigation progresses toward a final judgment. If Apple's appeal is not resolved until during or after the remedies trial, Apple may well be forced to stand mute at trial, as a mere spectator, while the government pursues an extreme remedy that targets Apple by name and would prohibit any commercial arrangement between Apple and Google for a decade.</blockquote><br/>
In addition to prohibiting deals between Apple and Google, the U.S. Department of Justice also has more extreme remedies in mind, including forcing Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/us-doj-wants-google-to-sell-chrome/">to sell its Chrome browser</a> and uncoupling Android from other products like Google Search and the Google Play Store. Google has a lot to defend against, and will prioritize Chrome over its deal with Apple.<br/>
<br/>
When initially asking to take a larger role in the case, Apple said that Google "can no longer adequately represent Apple's interests" because of the wide scope of the case. Unsurprisingly, the DoJ does not want Apple involved in the remedies portion of the trial, which is set to start in April.<br/>
<br/>
If the court decides that Google can't pay Apple to be the default search engine on Safari, Apple would still have to offer Google Search as an option in some capacity, but would not be able to continue to collect money for doing so.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/">Safari</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/apple-google-antitrust-lawsuit-stay/">Apple Wants to Help Google Defend Search Engine Deal Worth Billions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wants-to-help-google-defend-search-engine-deal-worth-billions.2448496/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fans of the hit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ show Severance are aware of the important role that self-help book "The You You Are" from Ricken Hale plays in the TV show, and now Apple has made a version of the book available to read or listen to.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Severance -- The You You Are Book Trailer Apple TV+" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/18tEP1gqHEY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The You You Are is available as a <a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-you-you-are/id6738364141">39-page book or an hour-long audio book</a> that's narrated by Michael Chernus, the actor who plays Ricken Hale on the show. In the foreword, Ricken Hale says that this is the first eight chapters of the book and the "first steps on the journey," suggesting Apple might debut additional chapters in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Severance viewers who like to theorize about what's going on in the show will undoubtedly want to take a deep dive into the new book, which Apple is using to promote the show.<br/>
<br/>
The second season of Severance debuted earlier this month, with Apple releasing new episodes on a weekly basis.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/severance-book-promotion/">You Can Now Read &#039;The You You Are&#039; Book From Apple TV+ Show Severance</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-now-read-the-you-you-are-book-from-apple-tv-show-severance.2448492/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/iphone-se-4-latest-leaks-rumors/id1602394741?i=1000687535116">The MacRumors Show</a>, we talk through all of the latest rumors about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> 4 as it nears launch. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jVhY1X3fJk?si=R98XaVRZFHqqB1dJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is widely rumored to feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14-style all-screen design with a 6.1-inch OLED display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, and USB-C. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/iphone-se-4-dummy/">Images of dummy models</a> showcasing the new design were recently shared online.<br/>
<br/>
Recent reports suggest that the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/iphone-se-4-a18-chip-identifier-leak/">support Apple Intelligence</a> thanks to the A18 chip and 8GB of memory. Both the main and front-facing cameras are expected to receive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/09/iphone-se-4-camera-details-revealed/">major upgrades</a> to 48- and 12-megapixel sensors, respectively. Contrary to earlier rumors, the device is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/latest-iphone-se-4-dummy-images-show-notch/">no longer expected</a> to feature the Camera Control, Action Button, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is highly likely to be the first to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-5g-modem-plans-report/">Apple's custom 5G modem</a>. While it won't feature mmWave connectivity and may be slower than the Qualcomm components currently used in iPhones, it is expected to offer lower power consumption, improved cellular network scanning, and satellite connectivity enhancements.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is due to be released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/ios-18-3-build-for-iphone-se-4-leak/">before iOS 18.4</a>, sometime around <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-by-april/">March or April</a>. It is expected to be slightly more expensive than the current model with a price point of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/30/iphone-se-4-could-be-more-expensive/">about &#36;470</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We also look ahead to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-watch-se-3-everything-we-know/">Apple Watch SE 3</a>, which is expected to debut later this year. With an all-new plastic casing that evokes the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5C, we reflect on the direction of Apple's entry-level devices. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> also has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 18.2, Apple introduced ChatGPT integration with Apple Intelligence to expand the range of AI capabilities accessible to users on supported iPhone models. One skill in particular that you may not be aware of is the ability to generate images in the Messages app, ready for sharing. ChatGPT leverages DALL·E to generate the images, and the results are almost invariably better than Apple's Image Playground. Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/chatgpt-image-messages.jpg" alt="" width="5386" height="3030" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987828" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Set Up ChatGPT on Your iPhone</h2><br/>
If you have Apple Intelligence enabled on an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16, setting up ChatGPT integration requires just a few steps, and you can begin without even having a ChatGPT account. You can always start with the basic setup and upgrade to a connected account later if needed, although in our tests there isn't too much difference between them when used within the context of daily iPhone usage.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap <strong>Apple Intelligence & Siri</strong>.</li><br/>
 <li>Under "Extensions," tap <strong>ChatGPT</strong>.</li><br/>
 <li>Toggle on the switch next to <strong>Use ChatGPT</strong>.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/enable-chat-gpt-extension-ios.jpg" alt="settings" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982519" /><br/>
<br/>
If you have a ChatGPT account (free or paid), you can optionally <strong>Sign In</strong> from this last screen using your account credentials.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Generate Images in Messages</h2><br/>
When ChatGPT integration is enabled, whenever you invoke Siri, the voice assistant analyzes your request to see if it's something that needs to be answered by ChatGPT. However, you can specify that you want to use ChatGPT simply by starting a Siri query with "ChatGPT." <br/>
<br/>
So the next time you're in a Messages conversation and want to express something with an image, tap inside the input field, hold down the Side button on your device to rouse Siri, then say something like, "ChatGPT, generate an image of a cat reading a book about fish." Give it a few seconds to think, and ChatGPT will drop the image into the text field, ready for it to be shared in the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/chatgpt-image-generation-messages.jpg" alt="messages" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987825" /><br/>
If you're happy with the output, just tap the <strong>Send</strong> button to send it on its way. If the image doesn't turn out quite how you hoped, you have a few options. You can tap <strong>Rewrite</strong>, and ChatGPT will re-generate from scratch a new image based on your prompt. <br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you can tap one of the provided suggestions from ChatGPT to add specific details to the image, or you can tap <strong>Refine with ChatGPT</strong> and type your own description for more exact detail requests. Simply hit the colored arrow button to send the prompt to ChatGPT, and it will work its magic. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/chatgpt-messages-image-refinement.jpg" alt="messages" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987827" /><br/>
As you can see, the combination of Siri and ChatGPT easily enhances the voice assistant's capabilities compared to what most iPhone users will be used to. The integration works well even for complex queries involving problem solving, writing assistance, detailed explanations, and step-by-step instructions.

		<description><![CDATA[If you own one of Apple's latest Mac mini or MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max processors, you may be interested to learn that CalDigit today <a href="https://www.caldigit.com/introducing-the-element-5-hub-e5/">announced</a> its first Thunderbolt 5 product, the Element 5 Hub.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/caldigit-tb-5-hub.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987813" /><br/>
The Element 5 Hub boasts nine ports, including four Thunderbolt 5 ports capable of up to 120Gb/s bandwidth, two USB-C ports at 10Gb/s, and three USB-A ports also running at 10Gb/s. The hub delivers consistent 90W charging to host devices, regardless of connected peripherals, thanks to its compact 180W power supply.<br/>
<br/>
Display support includes dual 8K monitors at 60Hz or dual 4K at 240Hz refresh rates, leveraging Thunderbolt 5's new Bandwidth Boost feature. CalDigit notes that Windows machines can handle up to three displays through a single Thunderbolt 5 connection, but unfortunately Mac users are limited to dual displays due to macOS limitations, even when using Apple's latest M4 chips.<br/>
<br/>
The hub doubles PCIe bandwidth to 64Gb/s compared to its predecessor, allowing it to accommodate faster storage devices. Meanwhile, power delivery remains stable at 90W for host charging, with 15W available from each downstream Thunderbolt 5 port and 7.5W from USB ports.<br/>
<br/>

The Element 5 Hub is available now <a href="https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-5-element-5-hub/">direct from CalDigit</a> in the United States for &#36;249.95, with UK and EU availability expected in mid to late February 2025.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has reached a &#36;20 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit alleging that certain early Apple Watch models suffered from a battery defect that caused screens to detach or crack (via <em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/apple-reaches-20m-settlement-in-watch-battery-lawsuit-heres-who-qualifies/">CNET</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-series-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-861810" /><br/>
Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the lawsuit accused Apple of manufacturing the original, Series 1, Series 2, and Series 3 Apple Watches without sufficient internal space to accommodate normal battery swelling. The plaintiffs argued that the lithium-ion batteries put pressure on the display and other components when they expanded, leading to structural damage. In some cases, users reported that the screens separated entirely from the watch casing. Apple has strongly denied any wrongdoing, but the company has agreed to settle the case to avoid prolonged litigation.<br/>
<br/>
Under the terms of the settlement, Apple will create a &#36;20 million non-reversionary fund to compensate consumers who experienced battery swelling issues with the affected models. Consumers who qualify will receive a payment of &#36;20 per affected device, with the potential for a higher amount depending on the total number of claims filed. As with most class-action settlements, the total amount received by individual claimants will depend on the number of participants and a significant portion of the &#36;20 million fund will also go toward legal fees and administrative costs. <br/>
<br/>
No claim form is required for class members who are already registered in Apple's records as having reported battery swelling issues. These individuals will automatically receive compensation unless they choose to opt out of the settlement by February 24, 2025. Apple Watch owners who believe they qualify but have not yet confirmed their eligibility need to do so by submitting their payment method on the <a href="https://www.watchsettlement.com">official settlement website</a> before April 10, 2025. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/apple-to-compensate-early-apple-watch-owners/">Apple to Compensate Early Apple Watch Owners in Lawsuit Settlement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-compensate-early-apple-watch-owners-in-lawsuit-settlement.2448475/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is in the final stages of selecting a key supplier for its next-generation foldable display technology, according to a new report from the Naver blog account "<a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223743058380&navType=by">yeux1122</a>," citing a source within Apple's supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Flip-iPhone-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960019" /><br/>
According to the report, Apple has maintained strict technical requirements for potential suppliers, focusing on maintaining current industry standards for thickness, size, and curvature radius while demanding significant improvements in durability and crease prevention. Some domestic component manufacturers are said to have recently made substantial progress in meeting Apple's exacting specifications.<br/>
<br/>
The supplier selection process is reportedly expected to conclude between late February and early April, though Apple has not yet made a final decision.<br/>
<br/>
While the report doesn't specify which device this display is intended for, the timing suggests a foldable iPhone. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently indicated that Apple's foldable iPhone remains in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/kuo-foldable-iphone-entering-mass-production-this-year/">planning stage</a>, with various analysts projecting a release between late 2025 and 2027. <em>The Information</em> has suggested Apple could release a clamshell-style foldable iPhone <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/foldable-iphone-2026-report/">as soon as 2026</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also reportedly exploring larger foldable devices. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> recently reported that the company is developing a roughly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/iphone-17-air-19-inch-macbook-report/">19-inch foldable device</a> "intended to serve as a laptop." <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has also mentioned plans for a "giant" foldable iPad that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/foldable-ipad-likely-set-for-2028-launch/">could launch in 2028</a>, noting Apple's intention to create a device without a visible crease that appears as a single piece of glass.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/">Foldable MacBook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/apple-nearing-decision-foldable-display-supplier/">Report: Apple Close to Selecting Supplier for Foldable Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-close-to-selecting-supplier-for-foldable-display.2448471/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook announced during the company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/30/apple-1q-2025-earnings/">Q4 2024 earnings call</a> that Apple Intelligence will soon support eight additional languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-iPhone-16.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964551" /><br/>
An update coming in April, likely as part of iOS 18.4, will also bring localized English support for users in India and Singapore, said Cook. Apple Intelligence is currently limited to English-speaking regions including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa.<br/>
<br/>
During the earnings call, Cook expressed his belief in the importance of Apple Intelligence features, noting that "once you start using the features you can't imagine not using them anymore." He specifically mentioned the email summarization function as a particularly valuable tool, stating that he personally relies on it to manage hundreds of daily emails.<br/>
<br/>
Several Apple Intelligence features have been available since the release of iOS 18.1, but its limited language support has restricted its global reach. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/apple-intelligence-eight-new-languages-april/">Apple Intelligence Support for Eight Additional Languages Arriving April</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-support-for-eight-additional-languages-arriving-april.2448468/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple designed Macs with Apple silicon chips to automatically turn on and start up when the Mac's lid is opened or when the Mac is connected to power, but there is a workaround in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> if you don't like this behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968484" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120622">new support document</a>, Apple provided separate instructions on how to prevent an Apple silicon Mac from turning on when the lid is opened or when it's connected to power. Both processes require the Terminal app. Apple's instructions:<br/>
<br/>
1. Make sure that your Mac laptop with Apple silicon is using &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; or later.<br/>
2. Open the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.<br/>
3. Type one of these commands in Terminal, then press Return:<br/>
- To prevent startup when opening the lid or connecting to power: sudo nvram BootPreference=%00<br/>
- To prevent startup only when opening the lid: sudo nvram BootPreference=%01<br/>
- To prevent startup only when connecting to power: sudo nvram BootPreference=%02<br/>
4. Type your administrator password when prompted (Terminal doesn't show the password as it's typed), then press Return.<br/>
<br/>
If you use these commands to change your Mac's behavior and want to undo it, you can open up Terminal and enter sudo nvram -d BootPreference.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/30/apple-keep-mac-turning-on-lid-open/">Apple Explains How to Keep Your Mac From Turning on When Opening Lid</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-how-to-keep-your-mac-from-turning-on-when-opening-lid.2448447/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held an earnings call to report results for the first fiscal quarter of 2025 (fourth calendar quarter of 2024), with Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and new Apple CFO Kevan Parekh providing insight into Apple's performance, holiday quarter product sales, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Apple-Logo-Cash-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-796911" /><br/>
We've highlighted the most interesting takeaways from the Q1 2025 earnings call.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Sales and Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
Services revenue was up, and there was an increase in Mac and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales were down. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue came in at &#36;69.1 billion, down from &#36;69.7 billion last year. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, which debuted in updates to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, does not appear to have resulted in a major upgrade cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models are, however, selling better in markets where &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; is available.<br/>
<br/>
On &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; adoption increasing over time, Cook said that since the feature set is limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models and the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup, growth will come as people upgrade to newer devices. Cook also said he expects to see some improvement when &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; becomes available in additional languages in April.<br/>
<br/>
"And I think I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features you can't imagine not using them anymore," Cook said. "I know I get hundreds of emails a day, and the summarization function is so important."<br/>
<br/>
In a separate answer, Cook said that new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features will be coming "over the next several months." &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features were expected in iOS 18.4, and it's not yet clear if Apple's plans have changed or the "next several months" means April.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Best Quarter to Date</h2><br/>
Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that Q1 2025 was Apple's best quarter to date with revenue of &#36;124.3 billion, a four percent increase year-over-year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new all-time high across all products and geographic segments, and Apple now has over 2.35 billion active devices worldwide. Sales in China were down, however. China brought in &#36;18.5 billion, down from &#36;20.8 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Services Revenue</h2><br/>
Services revenue continues to see notable growth, and the category brought in &#36;26.3 billion, up 14 percent from &#36;23 billion in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
All-time records were set in the Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia-Pacific.<br/>
<br/>
Paid subscriptions grew double digits, and Apple has more than a billion subscriptions across its services.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Sales</h2><br/>
Mac sales saw significant year-over-year growth, with revenue at &#36;9 billion, up from &#36;7.8 billion last year. Cook said Mac growth was thanks to new M4 Mac models.<br/>
<br/>
There was double digit growth in both upgraders and people new to the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Sales</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; sales grew 15 percent, and Cook said it was largely driven by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; rather than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. Over half of sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>DeepSeek</h2><br/>
Cook was asked about DeepSeek, and the perspective that Apple will benefit from lower cost on-device compute. Cook said that he believes that "innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Upcoming Products</h2><br/>
When Cook was asked if there was "a lot of room for form factor innovation" for future &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/30/tim-cook-on-iphone-innovation/">Cook said that</a> "there's a lot more to come" and that "there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Tariffs</h2><br/>
On the potential for tariffs, Cook said that Apple is "monitoring the situation" and doesn't have anything more to say.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next Quarter</h2><br/>
In the March quarter, Apple expects its overall revenue to grow low to mid single digits with gross margin between 46.5 and 47.5 percent.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/30/apple-q1-2025-earnings-call-takeaways/">Apple&#039;s Q1 2025 Earnings Call Takeaways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-q1-2025-earnings-call-takeaways.2448442/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[During today's earnings call covering the first fiscal quarter of 2025, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> was asked about whether he felt there was room for form factor innovation in future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, with the question hinting perhaps spurred by rumors of the upcoming<br/>
"<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> Air."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iPhone-17-Air-Size-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985933" /><br/>
Cook often declines to provide insight into future products during earnings calls, but he did give an encouraging answer. "I think there's a lot more to come," Cook said. "I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline."<br/>
<br/>
Cook went on to say that there is indeed room for change in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup. "I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple is designing a super thin version of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that will replace the "Plus" model in the series. The device is expected to be between 5mm and 6mm thick, which would make it the thinnest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date.<br/>
<br/>
In a separate question, Cook was asked whether the super thin design of the 12.9-inch M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> was driving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> revenue, but Cook said that wasn't the case. It's the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that were responsible for the 15 percent revenue growth the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; category saw during the holiday quarter.<br/>
<br/>
That's not a surprise given the high price of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Rumors have been split on how much Apple's super thin &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will cost, but it is expected to be less expensive than the Pro models. Apple will focus on design, with the device set to use a lower powered chip than the Pro models and a single-lens camera.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/30/tim-cook-on-iphone-innovation/">Apple CEO Tim Cook: There&#039;s a &#039;Lot of Innovation&#039; Left for Future iPhone Development</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-theres-a-lot-of-innovation-left-for-future-iphone-development.2448438/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/">announced</a> financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2025, which corresponds to the fourth calendar quarter of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/aapl-1q25-line.jpg" alt="" width="1902" height="772" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987767" /><br/>
For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of &#36;124.3 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;36.3 billion, or &#36;2.40 per diluted share, compared to revenue of &#36;119.6 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;33.9 billion, or &#36;2.18 per diluted share, in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-1q-2024-earnings/">year-ago quarter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple set all-time records during the quarter for total revenue, earnings per share, and services revenue. Total revenue was up 4 percent year-over-year, while earnings per share rose by 10 percent. Services, Mac, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> revenue figures were all up significantly year-over-year, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Wearables saw small declines.<br/>
<br/>
Gross margin for the quarter was 46.9 percent, compared to 45.9 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of &#36;0.25 per share, payable on February 13 to shareholders of record as of February 10.<blockquote>"Today Apple is reporting our best quarter ever, with revenue of &#36;124.3 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "We were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season. Through the power of Apple silicon, we're unlocking new possibilities for our users with Apple Intelligence, which makes apps and experiences even better and more personal. And we're excited that Apple Intelligence will be available in even more languages this April."</blockquote>As has been the case for over four years now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current quarter ending in March.<br/>

<br/>
<b>2:14 pm</b>: Kevan Parekh is taking over the call for the first time.<br/>

<b>2:15 pm</b>: "We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue. With December quarter revenue of &#36;124.3 billion, up 4% year over year, achieved all time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was &#36;98 billion, up 2% year over year, driven by growth from &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Mac. Thanks for our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our install base of active devices, reached an all time high across all products and geographic segments, and is now over 2.35 billion active devices."<br/>
<br/>
Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially. Services margin was 75%, up 100 basis points thanks to mix. Gross margin was 46.9 overall, up 70bp.<br/>

According to a recent survey from Kantar during the December quarter, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was a top selling model in the US or in China as well as the UK, France, Australia and Japan.

<br/>
<b>2:18 pm</b>: "Mac generated &#36;9 billion in revenue, up 16% year over year. We saw strength across our lineup, from the new Mac Mini to the latest &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models. This incredible performance was broad based with double digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac install base reached an all time high, and we saw a double digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the US was recently measured at 94%."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:18 pm</b>: "&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue was &#36;8.1 billion, up 15% year over year, driven by the new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Mini and latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; install base reached another all time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the US. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:19 pm</b>: "Wearables, home and accessories, revenue was &#36;11.7 billion, down 2% year over year. Customers are excited about the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> and the latest hearing health features in &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 and Watch, although we face a difficult compare against Apple Watch Ultra2 launch last year, the Apple Watch install base reached a new all time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for Watch in the US was reported at 94%."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:20 pm</b>: "Services revenue reached an all time high of &#36;26.3 billion, up 14% year over year. Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our install base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings, both transacting and paid accounts, reached new all time highs with paid accounts growing double digits year over year, paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over a billion paid subscriptions across the Services."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:21 pm</b>: Apple has &#36;141 billion in cash and marketable securities after repaying &#36;1 billion in maturing debt, and decreasing commercial paper by &#36;8 billion. &#36;97 billion in total debt, with net cash of &#36;45 billion after returning more than &#36;30 billion to shareholders through &#36;3.9 billion in dividends and &#36;23.3 billion in open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:22 pm</b>: FX headwinds expected to continue to be a challenge, an impact on revenue of 2.5% year over year. March quarter revenue is expected to grow low to mid single digits year over year. Services revenue expected to grow low single digits year over year, with a year over year growth rate comparable to the December quarter except for FX challenges. Gross margin between 46.5 and 47.5, with operating expenses between &#36;15.1 and &#36;15.3 billion. Expected tax rate around 16%.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:22 pm</b>: Dividend of &#36;0.25 per share payable on February 13.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:24 pm</b>: Q: In your prepared remarks, you noted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models were selling better in markets where &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; are available. Can you help us understand that how it's impacting &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; demand and what features are users using most often already?<br/>
<br/>
A: We did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence that the year over year performance on the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; family was stronger than those where Apple intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using. They're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments, from writing tools to image playground and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a> to visual intelligence and and more. <br/>
<br/>
We only had two and a half weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of 18.2, and then only had the UK and the other English language countries for the two and a half weeks. And so we've got, you know, just the early indications at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:27 pm</b>: Q: On China, can you talk about headwinds that Apple faces, is it shifting preferecnes for Western technology in favor of domestic ventors or is it function of not having &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; or replacement cycles?<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at Greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year over year. Over half of the decline we experienced was driven by a change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. On the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; side we have not rolled out in China, we saw better results we rolled out in than markets we had not. It's also the most competitive market in the world. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced recently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in December, but the national program was announced in January. It does cover products in categories we have up to a maximum price point, we do see fiscal stimulus occuring and will be glad to talk about what that's looking like on the next call.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:28 pm</b>: Q: Asking about the DeekSeek situation and the potential for costs to come down as Apple is a big beneficiary of lower cost compute.<br/>
<br/>
A: Innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing in general and that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software will continue to serve us very well. We do things on the device and the private cloud which mimics, from an architectural point of view, what happens on the device. From a CapEx point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach and we continue to leverage a hybrid model.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:29 pm</b>: Q: With regard to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; trajectory, you don't talk about new products but do you feel like there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future or is the current lineup showing where you're going? I'm wondering if you think, in terms of phone innovation, is there a lot more to come? Do you see the current market changing over the next few years?<br/>
<br/>
A: I think there's a lot more to come and I could not feel more optimistic about our current product pipeline. There's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:31 pm</b>: Q: Was encouraging to hear about the record for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; upgraders. What do you attribute this to? Was &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; playing a role in the markets you've launched in?<br/>
<br/>
A: We've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The install base hit a new all-time high as well and if you look at the 16 compared to the 15, from launch which occurred in September, so across two quarters, the 16 outperformed the 15. I think you can conclude from that there are compelling reasons to upgrade and in the markets where we've launched &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, they outperformed markets where we did not. Lots of good color there.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:32 pm</b>: Q: On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> M4, can you talk about that thin form factor for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;? How did it help &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; sales overall and what did your marketing and consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor?<br/>
<br/>
A: It's a good question. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; overall grew 15% for the quarter and it was more driven by &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and the entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; than the top-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. Overall, we could not be more pleased with the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; category growing 15%, it's a great achievement for the quarter and probably what is most important is that more than half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. There's still a good amount of customers to attract there.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:34 pm</b>: Q: Seeing robust growth trends in emerging markets right now, do you think some of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or growing fast enough to offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?<br/>
<br/>
A: We have great results in a number of emerging markets, I'm particularly keen on India and we're opening more stores there after setting a December quarter record. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was the top-selling model in India for the quarter and it's the second-largest smartphone market in the world and third-largest for PCs and tablets. It's a huge market and we have very modest share in these markets and I think there's lots of upside there and that's just one of the emerging markets.<br/>
<br/>
Emerging markets we're also seeing double digit growth on the install base in total and for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:35 pm</b>: Q: On gross margins for March, you're guiding flat. Usually you go up, is it all FX?<br/>
<br/>
A: We're guiding to 46.5-47.5, we're pleased with that level. There's always puts and takes, there will be FX headwinds that will affect revenue and margin, but it's offset by favorable costs and mix of services. Also, moving from Q1 to Q2, we do have a loss of leverage. We feel good about the range and it's a strong guide for gross margin.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:37 pm</b>: Q: You mentioned channel inventory in China. Do you feel like they're elevated or out of range in any other regions? Is this a normal progression into the March quarter?<br/>
<br/>
A: On a worldwide basis we're very comfortable with channel inventory position, in China, our channel inventory reduced from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and that was more than half of the reduction in reported results. Part of the reason is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be towards the end of the quarter, so we ended a little leaner than we expected to.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:38 pm</b>: Q: Servies growth has been strong but you've been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens. Do you think there's a top line or margin headwind that your'e currently absorbing that could potentially reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment?<br/>
<br/>
A: We set an all-time record for Services, up 14%, and we have a broad services portfolio and we have great momentum across the board. We have a billion paid subscriptions across the Services platform.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:40 pm</b>: Q: You had a great quarter on Macs and iPads both. And I'm just curious in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double digit growth that you saw in both the product lines?<br/>
<br/>
A: Mac was up 16% and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; up 15%, strong uptake on new products during the quarter. Launched M4-based &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; and Mac Mini during the quarter. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a> is designed for these workloads, but I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for the quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:41 pm</b>: Q: Re India being a strong and emerging market, to ask about supply chain planning there, how much is a growth expectation to that market vs diversification of the supply chain in that country?<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market and we export, so our business needs certain economies of scale to have it make sense to manufacture in country so it means we're going to need both a use for domestic market and export market.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:45 pm</b>: Q: How do we square &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; momentum with the gross margin profile and &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; as a momentum driver for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;? Where do you think Services margin could go from here being at 75%?<br/>
<br/>
A: Markets where we rolled out &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we hadn't. That gives us a positive indicator that we were pleased with. The other thing I would say, if you look at it from a launch to the end of the Dec. quarter, that goes back to Sept., the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family. I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April, and so it will be in our Q3 quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Re gross margin, Services margin is accretive to overall company margins, but we have a large services portfolio and they have wide gross margins. Payment services and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> are growing and when we add incremental users they are accretive to margins. What we expect on a company level is 46.5 to 47.5 and we think that's a strong guide.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:46 pm</b>: Q: How much of the Mac growth is normal replacement cycle versus &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj; innovation?<br/>
<br/>
A: I think it's a combination of these products being so compelling that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level and driving switchers at a double-digit level. We're seeing both come out and I think it's just because of compelling products.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:48 pm</b>: Q: On product gross margin, how much room do you have to improve or with AI related devices is there more room to grow or not?<br/>
<br/>
A: We had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points driven by favorable mix and leverage in Q1, it's a launch quarter for many products and we get leverage from higher volume. Our gross margin for products is driven by many factors, many products have different marging profiles and mix makes a difference. Many of our mix across phone, we see people gravitating towards our Pro products. Customers get into our best products and they have favorable gross margin. That trend impacted us and we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint and benefited in the December quarter.<br/>
<br/>
We'll have a FX headwind heading into the March quarter and that's included in the guidance we gave.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:50 pm</b>: Q: What might accelerate the pace of &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; adoption and is this time to launch more markets and languages or installed base, or is it about shifting marketing spend or R&D towards AI? Will there be a tipping point where adoption goes mainstream?<br/>
<br/>
A: I think it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today and this is, keep in mind that on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; side of our business, you either have to have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro or any &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; to use &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;. As that base grows, usage will continue to grow. Once you start using the features, you can't imagin not using them anymore. I get 100s of emails a day and the summarization function is so important.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a combination of that and in April we roll out a whole series of new languages that you had mentioned and the base grows further.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:51 pm</b>: Q: Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was getting Apple to record margin levels and maintaining consistent pricing across the product range. What observations can you share about price sensitivity of users and if having a wider range of pricing might unlock potentially further market share or boost overall product growth?<br/>
<br/>
A: I don't think we're gonna really depart from what served us pretty well until now. We always take into consideration looking at comparisons between short term and long term, I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy which was served us pretty well. And I think we're going to kind of stick with that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:51 pm</b>: Q: How do you you see any potential tariff impact under Trump 2.0 after you did fine under Trump 1.0?<br/>
<br/>
A: We are monitoring the situation and don't have any more than that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:52 pm</b>: Q: There's a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents. Upgraded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is coming in April, what do you think of that?<br/>
<br/>
A: I think the killer feature is different for different people and I think for most, they'll find they're going to use many of the features every day. One of those is &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and that will be coming over the next several months.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:53 pm</b>: Q: Thinking about the average useful life of these devices in the wild, the strong results you saw in 2021, how might that support opportunity in the future?<br/>
<br/>
A: It depends on different types of users. Some early adopters are quick to jump on the latest technology and upgrade very frequently and then you have people on the opposite side of that barbell. Most people are between those two points. I do think there were lots of units sold during the Covid period of time and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company for more than one of the product categories.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple held discussions with X (formerly Twitter) about once again showing ads on the social media site, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/amazon-raises-its-ad-spending-on-elon-musks-x-in-major-reversal-8a27228b">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>. The talks are said to have taken place "in recent weeks."<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904140" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/X-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
In an attempt to maintain a relationship with X, Apple was one of the companies that did not pause ad buying when Elon Musk took over the company, but Apple did <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/">stop its ad buying</a> in 2023 after Musk made antisemitic comments and there was evidence that Apple ads were being shown alongside pro-Hitler content.<br/>
<br/>
Given that Musk just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/21/elon-musk-nazi-roman-salute-difference-trump-inauguration">recently made a hand gesture</a> that was widely interpreted as a Nazi salute at Donald Trump's inauguration, Apple's decision to resume purchasing ads on X could be perceived as ill-advised.<br/>
<br/>
Musk is, however, a close Trump advisor and deeply involved with the Trump administration, so he could influence Trump's decisions concerning tech companies like Apple. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> donated &#36;1 million to Trump's inauguration and also attended the event, and other tech CEOs and companies have been plying the administration with funds. Apple did not donate.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> says that several major companies are reevaluating their stance on advertising on X. Amazon plans to up its ad spending as well, and the boost in advertising could help X with some of its debt. In January, Musk said that user growth was stagnant, revenue was "unimpressive," and that the company was "barely breaking even."<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/30/apple-x-ads-talks/">Apple Might Start Buying Ads on X Again</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-might-start-buying-ads-on-x-again.2448428/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mac apps can often go under the radar, with apps for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> receiving more attention. For that reason, we have a Mac-focused video series that highlights useful Mac apps we've come across. Our first picks of the year are largely simple, one-task apps that add utility to your Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XiLSieZ5b2c" title="8 Incredibly Useful Mac Apps for 2025!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://icemenubar.app">Ice Menu Bar Manager</a></strong> (Free) - Ice is a menu bar management tool that's an alternative to Bartender. Last year, Bartender was quietly acquired by a less than trustworthy company, and many no longer want to use it. Ice has a rich feature set. You can rearrange menu bar apps, change the look of the menu bar with colors, hide cruft, and more.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://dropoverapp.com">DropOver</a></strong> (&#36;5.99)- DropOver is a simple macOS app that enhances the Mac's Drag and Drop functionality. You can grab multiple files and move them around without opening side-by-side windows. You activate DropOver with a shake of the cursor, add items to a "shelf" and then you can move to your destination folder and unload them.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://max.codes/latest/">Latest</a> (Free)</strong> - Latest is a super simple app that checks to ensure that your apps are up to date. It supports apps that use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/">Mac App Store</a> and those that use Sparkle for updates, which is a good deal of the Mac apps out there.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://lo.cafe/notchnook">NotchNook</a></strong> (&#36;25) - NotchNook turns your Mac's notch into a little Mac version of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>. You can click into it and get shortcuts like a media player, the Calendar, quick notes, and more, plus it has drag and drop functionality that makes it easy to move files and send them using AirDrop. It's &#36;25, or &#36;3 per month.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.shortwave.com">Shortwave</a></strong> (Free, but unlocking more features costs &#36;7/month) - Shortwave is yet another email app, but it uses AI in a helpful way. It organizes your inbox to surface what's most important, it can create to-dos for you, add labels, archive unimportant email threads, search for content, alert you to emails that still need a response, and more. You can also use AI to summarize emails and get writing help, with the AI able to respond in your own voice based on past email correspondence. This is not a bare bones email app, so note that it can take some time to get used to. This is a subscription app and it starts at &#36;7 per month, paid annually.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://localsend.org">Local Send</a></strong> (Free) - If you need to share content between an iOS device or Mac and an Android device or a Windows PC, you can do so with Local Send. This is great if you're not entirely in the Apple ecosystem, because AirDrop doesn't work on non-Apple devices.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://sindresorhus.com/hyperduck">Hyperduck</a></strong> (&#36;4) - With Hyperduck, you can share links between your Macs, iPhones, and iPads with more control than AirDrop. You can, for example, save a webpage on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and have it open up later on your Mac, even if your Mac isn't turned on when you first save the website.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket</a></strong> (Free) - Rocket is another simple, one-function app that lets you add emojis in any app. Press on the colon key and then start typing in the emoji that you want. It's free to use, but a pro version adds options for adding GIFs and images.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google <a href="https://x.com/dozenrose/status/1885006588785877219">today started rolling</a> out a new experimental <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/install">"Ask for Me" feature</a> that's available as part of Search Labs. Google Search users can take advantage of AI to make calls to businesses for information like pricing and availability.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/google-ask-for-me.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987749" /><br/>
As of now, Google is testing the experimental feature with auto shops and nail salons, and it is designed to prevent users from having to place calls themselves. Businesses can opt out of the AI-based calls, and the feature does disclose that AI is being used at the beginning of a call.<br/>
<br/>
To use Ask for Me, Google Search users <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/26">can opt-in</a> to Search Labs and then search for a phrase like "oil change near me" or "manicure near me" to test it out. There are capacity limits in place, so there could be a waitlist before a call can be placed.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re testing right now with auto shops and nail salons, to see how AI can help you connect with businesses and get things done. <a href="https://t.co/inf5hhj1BS">pic.twitter.com/inf5hhj1BS</a></p>&mdash; Rose Yao (@dozenrose) <a href="https://twitter.com/dozenrose/status/1885006631752364249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
