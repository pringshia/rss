		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> Pro launched seven years ago today, offering a high-end all-in-one desktop machine to bridge the gap between new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/imac-pro-apple-newsroom.jpg" alt="" width="1142" height="644" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-831331" /><br/>
In April 2017, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/04/apple-apology-to-mac-pro-users-five-years-ago/">uncharacteristically apologised</a> for its approach to the Mac in recent years and pre-announced it was working on a "completely rethought" &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; with a modular design, a new pro-level &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, and a new high-end external display. At WWDC that year, Apple unveiled the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro, after years of rumors about a "Pro" &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro sought to placate many of Apple's discontented professional Mac users, coming around four years after the launch of the controversial "trashcan" &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;, but two years before the current &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; design, which returned to a modular tower design.<br/>
<br/>
Apple presented the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro as "the most powerful Mac ever made." It featured 8-, 10-, 14-, or 18-core Intel Xeon processor options, a 5K display, AMD Vega graphics, ECC memory, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet, with a starting price of &#36;4,999. It was also the first Mac to contain a custom T2 chip, as well as the first desktop Mac to be available in Space Gray. While it did not have a slot to easily access the memory like the 27-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, the processor, memory, and storage were not soldered in place and could easily be removed if the display was disassembled.<br/>
<br/>
In March 2021, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/06/apple-confirms-imac-pro-will-be-discontinued/">announced</a> that it was discontinuing the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro. By that time, the machine had been surpassed by the 2019 &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/04/new-27-inch-imac-10th-gen-intel/">significant final update</a> for the 27-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, and the first Apple silicon Macs. The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro's position in Apple's product lineup is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/17/apple-executives-discuss-mac-studio/">now effectively held</a> by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> and the Studio Display.<br/>
<br/>
Yet after the launch of the 24-inch Apple silicon &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; in April 2021 and the discontinuation of the 27-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; in March 2022, interest in an &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro with a larger display has increased. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/04/gurman-apple-still-working-on-pro-imac/">Mark Gurman believed</a> that Apple was still "working on a larger-screened &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; aimed at the professional market," a rumor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/06/kuo-imac-pro-in-2023-27-inch-display-this-year/">supported by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, as of 2022. Yet <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/11/apple-no-larger-screened-imac-pro/">other reports</a> claimed Apple has no plans to release a new high-end &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; at all. <br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that a larger-screened &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; that could be positioned as an &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">launch in 2025</a>. In July 2024, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-still-working-on-larger-imac/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple is still exploring a larger &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, but it is unclear when it could be released.

		<description><![CDATA[Visual Intelligence is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> feature that's exclusive to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models because it relies on the Camera Control button. Visual Intelligence is available as of iOS 18.2, and this guide outlines what it can do.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Visual-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982217" /><br/>
<h2 id="activating_and_using_visual_intelligence">Activating and Using Visual Intelligence</h2><br/>
To use Visual Intelligence, you need to hold down on the Camera Control button for a few seconds to activate the Visual Intelligence mode.<br/>
<br/>
Just pressing opens up the camera with Camera Control, so you do need a distinct press and hold gesture to get to it. Make sure you're not already in the Camera app, because it doesn't work if the camera is already active.<br/>
<br/>
The Visual Intelligence interface features a view from the camera, a button to capture a photo, and dedicated "Ask" and "Search" buttons. Ask queries ChatGPT, and Search sends an image to Google Search.<br/>
<br/>
Using Visual Intelligence requires taking a photo of whatever you're looking at. You need to snap a photo, which you can do with the Camera Control button, and select an option. It does not work with a live camera view, and you cannot use photos that you took previously.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="get_details_about_places">Get Details About Places</h2><br/>
If you're out somewhere and want to get more information about a restaurant or a retail store, click and hold Camera Control, and then click Camera Control again to take a photo or tap the name of the location at the top of the display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Visual-Intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970984" /><br/>
From there, you can see the hours when the business is open, place an oder for delivery at relevant locations, view the menu, view offered services, make a reservation, call the business, or visit the location's website.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="summarize_text">Summarize Text</h2><br/>
Take a photo of text from the Visual Intelligence interface. Choose the "Summarize" option to get a summary of what's written.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-summarize.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982208" /><br/>
The Summarize option is useful for long blocks of text, but it is similar to other &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; summaries so it is brief and not particularly in-depth.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="read_text_out_loud">Read Text Out Loud</h2><br/>
Whenever you take a Camera Control image of text, there is an option to hear it read aloud. To use this, just tap the "Read Aloud" button at the bottom of the display, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> will read it out loud in your selected &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; voice.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-read-aloud.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982207" /><br/>
<h2 id="translate_text">Translate Text</h2><br/>
If text that you capture with Visual Intelligence is not in your language (limited to English at this time), you'll see a "Translate" option. You can tap it to get an instant translation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-translate.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982209" /><br/>
<h2 id="go_to_website_links">Go to Website Links</h2><br/>
If there's a link in an image that you capture with Visual Intelligence, you'll see a link that you can tap to visit the website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-websites.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982213" /><br/>
<h2 id="send_emails_and_make_phone_calls">Send Emails and Make Phone calls</h2><br/>
If there is an email address in an image, you can tap it to compose an email in the Mail app. Similarly, if there is a phone number, you'll see an option to call it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-email.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982214" /><br/>
<h2 id="create_a_calendar_event">Create a Calendar Event</h2><br/>
Using Visual Intelligence on something that has a date will give you an option to add that event to your calendar.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-events.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982218" /><br/>
<h2 id="detect_and_save_contact_info">Detect and Save Contact Info</h2><br/>
For phone numbers, email addresses, and addresses, Apple says you can add the information to a contact in the Contacts app. You can also open address in the Maps app. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="scan_qr_codes">Scan QR Codes</h2><br/>
Visual Intelligence can be used to scan a QR code. With QR codes, you don't actually need to snap an image, you simply need to point the camera at the QR code and then tap the link that pops up.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-qr-code.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982212" /><br/>
QR code scanning also works in the Camera app without Visual Intelligence active.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ask_chatgpt">Ask ChatGPT</h2><br/>
You can take a photo of anything and tap on the "Ask" option to send it to ChatGPT while also asking a question about it. If you take a picture of an item with Visual Intelligence and want to know what it is, for example, you tap on Ask and then type in "What is this?" to get to a ChatGPT interface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-chatgpt.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982211" /><br/>
ChatGPT will respond, and you can type back if you have followup questions.<br/>
<br/>
Visual Intelligence uses the ChatGPT &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; integration, which is opt-in. By default, no data is collected, but if you sign in with an OpenAI account, ChatGPT can remember conversations.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="search_google_for_items">Search Google for Items</h2><br/>
You can take a picture of any item that you see and tap on the "Search" option to use Google Image Search to find it on the web. This is a feature that's useful for locating items that you might want to buy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence-google-search.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982210" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2, Apple introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, the feature that lets you create a custom emoji character if there's not already an emoji that exists for what you want to depict.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Genmoji-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975006" /><br/>
You can create &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; from the emoji keyboard in Messages, Notes, and more, and the characters work much like emoji. &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;, like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, have significant restrictions put in place to prevent people from creating objectionable images, and these guardrails can make it hard to make what you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; are anything but open-ended, so I thought I'd highlight some of what you can and can't do with the custom emojis as of right now.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Humans in Poses and Generic Humans</h2><br/>
With anything that's even vaguely humanoid, &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; almost always prompts you to choose a person to base the result on. You can choose yourself or a friend or family member that you have images of in Photo Library, or you can use a standard emoji character.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/genmoji-select-a-character.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982197" /><br/>
The requirement is aggressive and limiting because it doesn't take into account context, and it prevents the creation of generic human-adjacent items and characters.<br/>
<br/>
Gingerbread man, for example, does not produce a gingerbread man. It prompts for a person and then outputs an irrelevant image that may or may not include some kind of holiday item. If you're wondering if "gingerbread cookie" produces the desired result, it sometimes will and it sometimes won't.<br/>
<br/>
The requirement to add a character isn't too much of a surprise because it means <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> cannot pick a skin tone, race, or gender on its own, so there's nothing to default to. But it does result in some restrictions on poses and getting an activity depicted that you prefer. A lot of times, &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; that use your image or a friend or family member default to a head and shoulders view, and it can be tricky to get a more full body pose.<br/>
<br/>
This is a bigger problem with &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; than &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;, but it can still cause frustration.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Humanoid Creatures and Items</h2><br/>
&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; does not like to generate humanoid creatures that aren't based on a person or an emoji. Trying to get the feature to create a simple garden gnome, for example, is a feat. I couldn't get &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; to make a garden gnome with any of the following phrases:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Gnome</li><br/>
 	<li>Garden gnome</li><br/>
 	<li>Non-humanoid gnome</li><br/>
 	<li>Gnome statue</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
For all of these entries, &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; spat out a picture of an emoji person in an elf-style holiday hat. What did work to get a garden gnome, though, was "statue of a gnome," phrased that specific way. Later, I tried again, and couldn't get it to work even with that. But "statue gnome" worked, so it's hit or miss what you'll get. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/genmoji-gnome.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982198" /><br/>
There are instances where you can get what you're looking for with workarounds like that, but Apple has &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; so locked down that it's a frustrating exercise.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/genmoji-fantasy-creatures.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982199" /><br/>
After not being able to make a gnome, I tried a range of mythological creatures. There wasn't a lot of consistency between what I was able to generate and what didn't work.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Creatures Genmoji Generated</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Sasquatch</li><br/>
 	<li>Yeti</li><br/>
 	<li>Dragon</li><br/>
 	<li>Minotaur</li><br/>
 	<li>Unicorn</li><br/>
 	<li>Hydra</li><br/>
 	<li>Ogre</li><br/>
 	<li>Leprechaun</li><br/>
 	<li>Goblin</li><br/>
 	<li>Phoenix</li><br/>
 	<li>Hippogriff</li><br/>
 	<li>Hellhound</li><br/>
 	<li>Manticore (but not really)</li><br/>
 	<li>Sphinx</li><br/>
 	<li>Bunyip</li><br/>
 	<li>Elf</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3>Creatures That Didn't Work</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Mermaid</li><br/>
 	<li>Wendigo</li><br/>
 	<li>Kraken (Sea monster works instead)</li><br/>
 	<li>Wyvern</li><br/>
 	<li>Basilisk</li><br/>
 	<li>Cockatrice</li><br/>
 	<li>Chupacabra</li><br/>
 	<li>Tanuki</li><br/>
 	<li>Jackalope</li><br/>
 	<li>Wolpertinger</li><br/>
 	<li>Wampus</li><br/>
 	<li>Chimera</li><br/>
 	<li>Ouroboros</li><br/>
 	<li>Golem</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3>Creatures That Required a Human Character</h3><br/>
With creatures in this category, it prompted me to add a person. These worked with varying degrees of success. Centaur added horns, for example, but Orc basically just put the character in armor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/genmoji-creatures-person.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982200" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Vampire</li><br/>
 	<li>Werewolf</li><br/>
 	<li>Centaur</li><br/>
 	<li>Orc</li><br/>
 	<li>Fairy</li><br/>
 	<li>Selkie (just generated a standard person)</li><br/>
 	<li>Anubis (just generated a standard person)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Violence, Nudity, Celebrities, and Copyrights</h2><br/>
This category won't come as a surprise. Apple doesn't allow anything that's remotely violent, and &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; can't be used to create any copyrighted characters or celebrities.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, you can actually make creations that feature celebrities by uploading a picture, but that's not an option for &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
You can generate a gun, but the gun can't shoot, even if you want it to shoot bubbles or water. Words like "shooting" are off limits in combination with words like gun.<br/>
<br/>
Apple won't let you make copyrighted items, even an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Given &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;'s tendency to warp items, it's no shock that you can't create a funny-looking &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Anatomy and Facial Expressions</h2><br/>
&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; is <em>really</em> bad at facial expressions and emotions. It can mostly get happy and sad, but anything with any nuance likely isn't going to happen.<br/>
<br/>

As for anatomy, you're not always going to get the correct number of fingers, toes, or limbs for your creations, but that's not atypical with AI.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Multiple People</h2><br/>
&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; can't generate something with more than one person, and if you try, it will tell you to describe just one person.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/genmoji-one-person.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982201" /><br/>
<h2>Text</h2><br/>
Like most image generation engines, &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; doesn't do well with text. Text almost always comes out looking garbled.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/genmoji-book.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982205" /><br/>
<h2>What Genmoji Does Really Well</h2><br/>
&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; works well with animals, even animals that aren't super common. It won't get down to a species level, so you can't, for example, make an accurate swallowtail butterfly, but as long as you're not looking for that kind of specificity, you'll get an accurate butterfly.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/genmoji-inline.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974996" /><br/>
Animals combined with objects tends to work well too, as do many objects. Objects that have a lot of parts like a saxophone or a violin can sometimes come out wonky, but for the most part, &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; does a good job creating different items and even merging them together.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Giving Genmoji Open-Ended Concepts</h2><br/>
If you want to get an idea of how &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; works, giving it open-ended prompts that aren't a specific object is a fun exercise. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/genmoji-open-ended-concepts.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982220" /><br/>
For example:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Scrumptious</strong> - &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; made a rainbow-colored plate with bread, a pumpkin, a tomato, and what looks like an olive. The next several images generated were cakes, and there was also a present and a plate of pasta.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Delicious</strong> - It gave me a steak on a weird pan, a cake, a donut, a cupcake, and a hot air balloon.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Cuddly</strong> - This generated a bear, a bear with flowers, a sleeping cat, a bunny in a basket, a mouse with heart eyes, and an emoji face wrapped in a blanket.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Snuggly</strong> - The first option I got was a smiling face, followed by emoji faces wrapped in blankets.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Comforting</strong> - An arm chair, a rocking chair, a sunset, and several weird emoji faces, none of which are comforting.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Horrific</strong> - A purple monster, a spider with 10 legs, an alien-like emoji face with 10 tentacles, a glowing crystal, a fanged octopus with six legs, and a snake with a fork.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
With &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;, you're going to get something different every time you put in a description, even if you repeat a description. Images are being generated on the fly, so there is variation with every one.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Genmoji Tips</h2><br/>
If you can't get something to work, rephrasing and rearranging words can be successful. Santa raccoon, for example, required a person, but raccoon Santa gave the desired effect of a raccoon in a red hat. Raccoon in a Santa hat works too, but simpler descriptions tend to produce the best results.<br/>
<br/>
While &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; has a feature for adding in multiple ideas and refining as you go, &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; has a harder time with too much specific detail. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's Genmoji Ad</h2><br/>
Apple shared a &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; ad yesterday, and as <em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/12/12/new-genmoji-ad-showcases-creations-that-definitely-were-not-made-with-apple-intelligence">AppleInsider</a></em> pointed out, the ad is pretty misleading. It shows &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; that were not created with &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, and in fact it uses some phrases that simply won't work.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Apple Intelligence Imagine it. Genmoji it. iPhone 16" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XROs4K67Y9Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Below, I've listed whether or not I could get the description that Apple uses to work. Some required modifications, some I couldn't make at all, and some came out looking odd.<br/>
<h3>Apple's Genmoji Ad Keywords That Work (With Caveats)</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Gnome</strong> - It worked, but with "statue of a gnome" phrasing.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Foam</strong> - It didn't have a smiley face, but I kind of got there by specifying a pile of shaving cream with eyes and a smile.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Pink comb</strong></li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Skeleton made of chrome</strong></li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Dog balloon</strong> - I only got a dog holding a balloon until I changed to balloon animal dog.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Tomato spy</strong> - This sort of worked when I used "a tomato dressed like a detective wearing sunglasses," but I could not get a full body tomato spy.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A horse wearing a tie</strong></li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Bucatini with some peas</strong> - Most of what it generated looked nothing like pasta, but I did get a pasta-adjacent thing topped with peas.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Anemones</strong> - Just anemones gave me a flower. I had to add sea to get anything resembling Apple's, but even then it looked nothing like an actual sea anemone.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Blocks of cheese</strong></li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Anemones and blocks of cheese bumping MP3s</strong> - It did generate a block of cheese and a sea anemone wearing headphones, but I had to use the "wearing headphones" phrasing. The sea anemone didn't look anything like one.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Pig in the sky</strong> - This worked a lot better when I added "winged."</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Clock that can talk</strong> - This kind of worked when I asked it to make a grandfather clock with a mouth and eyes, but not with just a clock that can talk. It still didn't look like Apple's.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A furry cardigan</strong> - When I described it as a "furry cardigan that's light pink and has embroidered flowers," I got something like Apple's image.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Lasso</strong> - It generated ropes in circle shapes, but none that were exactly lassos.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Candy pile</strong> - It made candy, but they were all mostly a pile of gumballs</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Can of worms</strong> - I thought this would turn out well, but it mostly made cans that had a worm on the front. My favorite was a yellow can with an emoji face that had worms coming out of the mouth.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Golden smile</strong> - Apple's image is a gold tooth. I only got an emoji face when using "golden smile," but I got a creepy gold tooth with a face when I used "gold tooth smiling."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3>Apple's Genmoji Ad Keywords That Don't Work</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Socrates on mountain skis</strong> - Without fail, trying this made me select a person, and it came out looking nothing like Socrates. I couldn't use a historical figure at all.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>12-sided die</strong> - It could not make a die that looked different from a standard die. It also would not let me use "12-sided die" at all, but at least "twelve sided die" made dice.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Chair that can walk</strong> - I couldn't get it to generate a chair that had human-like legs with shoes. It just kept making standard chairs.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A little painting of a guy in a hat</strong> - It kept adding an emoji person with just the head and shoulders. I couldn't get a nondescript "guy in a hat."</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A heart-shaped tat</strong> - I only got emoji hearts. One was a realistic heart (the organ) with a pen through it that was inventive, but not what I was looking for.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Gizmo</strong> - This was a straight no. It told me to describe something different.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Little egg man throws his hands in the air going wild</strong> - This got me an emoji character of myself juggling eggs. Adding "man" triggers the person feature. Taking out man got me an egg with arms, but not a fried egg. Adding fried got me a creepy egg with a face and arms.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Sharing Genmoji with Older iPhones and Android Devices</h2><br/>
If you make a &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; and send it to someone with iOS 18.1 or iOS 18.2, it'll show up like an emoji in iMessage conversations. &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; sent to Android users or those who have older iOS or macOS devices will see &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; as an image in a text message conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-genmoji-older-device.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975002" /><br/>
<h2>Battery Usage</h2><br/>
Creating a bunch of &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; or images with &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; can cause significant battery drain, because all of the processing is done on-device. An hour and a half of &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; creation drained my battery from over 50 percent to five percent.<br/>

		<title>iOS 18.2: Here&#039;s How Mail Categories Work</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 18.2, Apple added a Categories view in the Mail app, which is designed to organize your incoming emails by type. Categories hasn't been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1hd3tm2/regular_users_of_the_ios_mail_app_what_do_you/">receiving the best response</a> from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users, so we thought we'd check it out.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iOS 18.2 Mail Features: How to Use Categories (and How to Turn Them OFF)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfyIjRIPUcQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Mail Categories organizes your email inbox into the following sections: Primary for your most important messages, Transactions for your orders and receipts, Promotions for deals and offers, and Updates for news, subscriptions, and social.<br/>
<br/>
When Mail Categories is enabled, your Primary inbox will be front and center, and then you can swipe over to see other emails that fall into the other categories. The idea is that emails that aren't important like newsletters and deals are tucked away, but there's also an added benefit of having all of your order receipts in one spot, or your emails about sales in one section of your inbox.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a useful feature that aggregates all of the emails from a single sender into one view, so you can see all of your Amazon emails in one place, or everything you've received from an airline. To get to this view, you just need to tap into any email from that sender and then scroll up to see other messages.<br/>
<br/>
The Primary inbox contains emails from other categories, and it's a feature that can make sense for someone with an overwhelming inbox, but it's not likely something that inbox zero people are going to like.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't like Mail Categories, you can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-disable-apple-mail-categories/">swap back over to List View</a> by tapping on the three dots in the upper right corner of the Mail app, but if you do want to give Mail Categories a try, there are a couple tips worth noting.<br/>
<br/>
To get to a view of your inbox with all emails in chronological order without swapping views, just swipe left on the category bar to get to the "All Mail" option.<br/>
<br/>
It's not uncommon for an email to be sent to the wrong category, and if that happens, you can tap into the email, tap on the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the display, and then choose the Categorize Sender option to choose a category manually. If you're in the Primary inbox, though, you need to hit reply and then choose the Categorize Sender option.<br/>
<br/>
When you tap into a message from a sender, you can delete all emails from that sender by using the three dots at the top right of the display and choosing the "Trash All" option.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to stop selling the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and third-generation iPhone SE in European Union countries later this month, to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/04/eu-passes-law-to-switch-iphone-to-usb-c-in-2024/">comply with a regulation</a> that will soon require newly-sold smartphones with wired charging to be equipped with a USB-C port in those countries, according to <a href="https://www.igen.fr/iphone/2024/12/apple-va-arreter-la-vente-des-iphone-se-et-iphone-14-dans-lunion-europeenne-147523">French blog <em>iGeneration</em></a>. All three of these iPhone models are still equipped with a Lightning port for wired charging.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/iPhone-SE-3-Apple-Newsroom.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982180" /><br/>
In a paywalled report today, the website said the iPhone models will no longer be sold through Apple's online store and retail stores in the European Union as of December 28, which is when the regulation goes into force. Apple may begin phasing out the iPhones even earlier in Switzerland, which has a close relationship with the European Union market. There, the report states that the devices will be removed from Apple's online store as of December 20.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Authorized Resellers in the European Union will be able to continue selling these iPhones until their remaining inventory is depleted, the report added.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to stop selling some other Lightning-based products in the European Union as well, including its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQ052LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english">extended Magic Keyboard without Touch ID</a>, according to the report. That keyboard is still equipped with a Lightning port for charging.<br/>
<br/>
There are 27 countries in the European Union, including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden. While the United Kingdom left the European Union in 2020, the report said Apple will stop selling the devices in Northern Ireland, which continues to follow many of the European Union's trade laws.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the source of this information, the report said Apple shared these details with its relevant internal teams. Apple did not respond to our requests for comment, but we will update this story if the company confirms or denies the report.<br/>
<br/>
According to a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:C:2022:247:FULL">guide</a> published by the European Union in 2022, the USB-C port regulation will apply to any individual iPhone that is placed on the market after the regulation goes into force, even if they are models that launched beforehand, like the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and the current iPhone SE. At a minimum, that means Apple would not be able to sell any iPhones with a Lightning port manufactured after December 28.<br/>
<br/>
The relevant passage from the guide:<blockquote>Even though a product model or type has been supplied before new Union harmonization legislation laying down new mandatory requirements entered into force, individual units of the same model or type, which are placed on the market after the new requirements have become applicable, must comply with these new requirements.</blockquote>While the European Union has suggested that the regulation does not prevent existing stock from being sold, which explains why Apple Authorized Resellers would be able to sell through their remaining inventory, it is not entirely clear to us how the regulation applies to any iPhones that Apple may have already stockpiled in factories. In any case, the report said that Apple's decision is to stop selling the devices soon.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/iphone-se-4-expected-to-launch-in-march/">fourth-generation iPhone SE with a USB-C port in March</a>, so the device would quickly return to the European Union. Meanwhile, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus likely would have been discontinued in September, so sales of those devices would be ending in the European Union around nine months early.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macgeneration-com/">MacGeneration</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/13/iphone-14-and-iphone-se-eu-report/">Report: Apple to Stop Selling iPhone 14 and iPhone SE in EU This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-to-stop-selling-iphone-14-and-iphone-se-in-eu-this-month.2445347/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's online store is offering a range of new accessories this week, several of which are exclusive to Apple and can't be purchased elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/nimble-3-in-1-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982122" /><br/>
For charging up an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple Watch, and AirPods, Apple is offering the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRWP2ZM/A/nimble-podium-3-in-1-wireless-charger">Nimble Podium 3-in-1 Charger</a>. Priced at &#36;140, the charger comes in black or a multicolor option with shades of blue and white, and it is made from recycled plastic and aluminum.<br/>
<br/>
There's a Qi2 magnetic charger that is compatible with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> iPhones and able to charge them at up to 15W, along with a fast charger for compatible Apple Watch models. The AirPods platform charges the AirPods at 5W. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch charging pucks can be used while upright or folded flat, and because of the folding mechanism, this has the potential to work well for travel. The charger ships with a USB-C to USB-C cable and a 36W USB-C power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
For charging on the go, Apple is offering an exclusive <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRY02LL/A/anker-maggo-power-bank-5k-slim-blue">MagGo Power Bank from Anker</a>, which is priced at &#36;50. The MagGo comes in either blue or white, and it offers Qi2 charging at up to 15W. There is a 5,000mAh battery inside that will add extra power to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it's super slim compared to other magnetic power banks so it won't add too much bulk to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. There is a USB-C port for charging purposes, and while it comes with a USB-C cable, you'll need to supply your own power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/anker-battery-pack-apple.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982125" /><br/>
If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, you might be interested in the latest Vision Pro carrying case that Apple's offering through its online store. The <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRXK2ZM/A/von-holzhausen-carry-sling-for-apple-vision-pro">von Holzhausen Carry Sling for Vision Pro</a> is much more svelte than Apple's carrying case, though it is expensive at &#36;180. The carrying case is described as "ultra compact," with a space for the headset and band, a slot for the battery, and extra internal and external pockets for accessories.<br/>
<br/>

Crafted from lightweight plant-based bamboo material, the sling can be worn crossbody or as a shoulder bag, and it has a removable strap and retractable grab handle so it can also be tucked inside a backpack or a suitcase. There is a padded interior with a microfiber liner to keep everything inside safe.<br/>
<br/>
The new products are available from Apple's online store, and in some Apple retail locations for immediate pickup.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/13/apple-store-new-vision-pro-case/">Apple Begins Selling New Vision Pro Carry Sling and Exclusive Charging Accessories</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-new-vision-pro-carry-sling-and-exclusive-charging-accessories.2445343/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ry9MFyxGDs?si=HWBsqtVul0h07qO0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Apple's year started out with the launch of the highly anticipated Vision Pro headset in February. This "spatial computer" marked Apple's first brand new product line in years, seeking to blend the physical and digital worlds. Powered by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and R1 chips, the Vision Pro uses over a dozen sensors and cameras to map environments in real-time, boasting two high-resolution displays for immersive experiences and advanced hand-tracking.<br/>
<br/>
In March, Apple refreshed its popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> lineup, unveiling new 13- and 15-inch models powered by the M3 chip. May brought significant updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup. Apple launched the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> 6, now available in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes and powered by the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, and the redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, featuring OLED displays for the first time and the debut of the M4 chip. Accompanying these devices was the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, offering precision enhancements and haptic feedback for creative professionals, and the Magic Keyboard for &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, which further bridges the gap between iPads and laptops.<br/>
<br/>
Apple hosted its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, unveiling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> with enhanced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> customization, a redesigned Control Center, and more. The company also previewed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>, tvOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a>, but the biggest announcement was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> – a new suite of AI tools for Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, September was packed with major announcements. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup debuted, with the standard models embracing Pro-like features such as the Camera Control button, Action button, and spatial video capture. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max gained bigger displays, longer battery life, an improved ultra wide camera, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 10 launched in September, showcasing a thinner design, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> gained a black color option and a new titanium Milanese Loop. Apple also debuted the fourth-generation AirPods, now with optional ANC, and a USB-C version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. October saw a minor refresh of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> with the A17 Pro chip and &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple closed the year with a focus on its Mac lineup, bringing the M4 family of chips to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>. Most notably, the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; was completely redesigned with an even smaller enclosure measuring just 5 inches by 5 inches. The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; and &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; also gained enhanced cameras and a nano-texture display option for the first time, along with a series of other small but significant improvements. Alongside this, Apple finally refreshed its Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard with USB-C connectivity.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[As part of his ongoing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/10/apples-investment-in-the-uk-exceeds-18-billion/">visit to the United Kingdom</a>, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/12/his-majesty-king-charles-iii-visits-apples-uk-headquarters/">yesterday hosted</a> His Majesty King Charles III at its headquarters in Battersea Power Station.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Apple-Battersea-community-impact-Tim-Cook-and-King-Charles-III.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1351" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-982053" /><br/>
During the visit, Cook welcomed King Charles to Apple's campus in the iconic Battersea Power Station, a recently restored historic building that became home to Apple's UK operations <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/26/apple-battersea-campus-to-open-early-2023/">in 2023</a>. Battersea Power Station's conversion into Apple's UK headquarters represents a significant step up in the company's presence in London. The historic building, once a coal-fired power station designed to supply west London with electricity, has been transformed from a derelict building into a modern office campus that houses over 1,400 employees. <br/>
<br/>
The King toured the facility, meeting Apple employees, students from local schools, and members of the British creative community. The visit included a showcase of Apple's educational initiatives in collaboration with The King's Trust, a UK-based nonprofit, with a focus on providing young people with educational opportunities and skills development.<br/>
<br/>
Young people affiliated with the charity demonstrated coding projects they developed using Apple's tools and resources. Children from nearby St. George's Primary School also participated, creating holiday-themed artwork on iPads, which were later projected onto Battersea Power Station's iconic chimneys.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>We were honored to welcome His Majesty King Charles to Apple Battersea — our home in the UK — and we're proud to support The King's Trust in its vital work educating and empowering young people. We look forward to our continued growth here, building on more than 40 years of history in the United Kingdom.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The event concluded with a community-focused holiday concert by award-winning British musician RAYE, held in the atrium of Battersea Power Station. Cook also presented King Charles with an etched plaque to commemorate his visit.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's engagement with the UK creative sector was also highlighted by a recent collaboration with Aardman, the acclaimed animation studio behind <em>Wallace & Gromit</em>. The two entities partnered to create a stop-motion animation using the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max's camera system. The short film started being projected onto Battersea Power Station's chimneys <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/29/wallace-and-gromit-shot-on-iphone/">earlier this month</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/13/tim-cook-hosts-king-charles-iii/">Apple CEO Tim Cook Hosts King Charles III at UK Headquarters</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-hosts-king-charles-iii-at-uk-headquarters.2445327/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The factory has reportedly been making AirPods on a trial basis, with manufacturing set to ramp up quickly after production begins. It will make AirPods only the second major Apple product to be assembled in India after the iPhone. <br/>
<br/>
The decision to set up production in India was requested by Apple back in 2023, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/16/foxconn-wins-airpods-order-india/">previous report</a>. Foxconn officials apparently debated internally for months about whether to assemble AirPods due to the relatively low profit margins, but ultimately decided to go ahead with it to "reinforce engagement" with Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government offers financial incentives to companies that produce wireless earphones and smartwatches locally, which influenced Apple's decision to move manufacturing there. The move is also part of Apple's plan to reduce its production reliance on China amid rising geopolitical tensions between the country and the United States. <br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple supplier Jabil began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/apple-making-airpods-india/">making AirPods enclosures in India</a> for shipping to China and Vietnam, where the earphones are currently assembled. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s sources, exports of Apple iPhones from India jumped by a third in the six months through September, reaching nearly &#36;6 billion. Most of the AirPods to be assembled in India next year will likely also be shipped to other markets. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/13/airpods-made-in-india-from-next-year/">AirPods to Be Made in India for the First Time Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-to-be-made-in-india-for-the-first-time-next-year.2445320/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's rumored new iPhone 17 Air model has entered the new product introduction phase (NPI) at Foxconn, according to supply chain sources (via <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241212PD223/apple-iphone-ultra-thin-design-foldable.html">DigiTimes</a></em>). <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Generic-iPhone-17-Feature-With-Full-Width-Dynamic-Island-single-camera.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959833" /><br/>
The NPI phase transitions a product from concept to mass production, beginning with design validation and prototype testing, followed by supplier qualification and manufacturing process development. Pilot production runs test the assembly and refine quality control, while aligning logistics with the supply chain, with the ultimate aim of ramping up to full-scale manufacturing.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 17 Air is expected to replace the Plus model in Apple's lineup and will reportedly offer a significantly slimmer design that current iPhone models. The handset will be about two millimeters thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/iphone-17-air-2mm-thinner/">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As for size, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to fall somewhere between the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. Separate rumors have claimed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">6.55 inches</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">6.6 inches</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/">6.65 inches</a> as the display size that Apple has settled on, which would make it smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but larger than the 17 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to equip the ‌iPhone 17‌ Air with its own custom-designed 5G modem chip, which is smaller than 5G modem chips from Qualcomm. Apple has focused on making the chip more integrated with other Apple-designed components to save space within the ‌iPhone‌ without sacrificing battery life or display quality, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the rear camera will be relocated from the upper left side of the iPhone to the center of the device, as part of a "large, centred camera bump," <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">according to <em>The Information</em></a>. Analyst Jeff Pu believes it will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/">single 48-megapixel lens</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 17 Air will debut next year alongside a standard iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max – the Pro models of which are said to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/iphone-17-pro-redesign-backed-by-supply-chain-info/">significant design changes of their own</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/13/iphone-17-air-enters-product-introduction-phase/">iPhone 17 Air Model Enters Product Introduction Phase at Foxconn</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-model-enters-product-introduction-phase-at-foxconn.2445315/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp has <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/improved-calling-this-holiday-season">announced</a> some improvements to its calling features across desktop and mobile platforms ahead of the holiday season, such as the ability to choose participants from group chats, use new effects on calls, and take advantage of higher resolution video.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/whatsapp-calling-updates.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982028" /><br/>
The ability to select specific participants when initiating a call from a group chat aims to let users avoid disturbing the entire group, and could be helpful for coordinating surprise events or private discussions within larger group contexts.<br/>
<br/>
The update also brings ten new video effects to make calls more fun and engaging, ranging from playful puppy ear filters to underwater themes and karaoke microphone effects. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, WhatsApp says desktop users will benefit from a reorganized calls interface that should streamline the process of starting calls, creating call links, or dialing numbers directly from the desktop app. Lastly, the Meta-owned company has also enhanced video call quality across both one-on-one and group calls, regardless of whether users are connecting from desktop or mobile devices.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/13/whatsapp-calling-updates-desktop-mobile/">WhatsApp Rolls Out Calling Updates for Desktop and Mobile</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-rolls-out-calling-updates-for-desktop-and-mobile.2445312/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 18.2 Includes New Find My Option for Sharing Lost Luggage Location With Airlines</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2, Apple added a new feature to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> app that's designed to let you share a lost item's location with a trusted person. The feature is meant to help you locate an item through a third-party, such as an airline's customer service staff.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/ios-18-2-share-item-location.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981923" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app has an option to "Share Item Location" and "Show Contact Info." If you choose the Share Item Location option, a link is created that lets someone see the location of a lost item when they open it up. Links can be opened on a non-Apple device using a web browser, so people without an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac can help you locate something that's lost.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Find My&zwnj; links that you share expire after a one-week period, and you can see how many people have viewed a link. Shared links stop working when an item is returned to you, when the link sharing date expires, or when you opt to stop sharing the location of an item. Share Item Location is end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, so Apple and accessory manufacturers are not able to view an item's location or information.<br/>
<br/>
Tapping on the Show Contact Info option lets any phone, computer, or tablet connect to a lost item to open a website with more information about it, including the phone number and email address of the person who owns it. You can use this feature to provide details about an item that you've lost, or to view details about an item you've found that you want to return to its owner.<br/>
<br/>
While &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; already allowed you to share an item with a person in your Contacts list, the Share Item Location feature in iOS 18.2 gives you a way to temporarily show an item's location to someone else who might be able to help you find it. It works with AirTags and other devices that connect to Apple's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network.<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us/newsroom/announcements/cision-125359">United Airlines</a> and Air Canada have implemented support for the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Share Item Location feature for lost bags, and Apple says that additional airlines plan to implement support "soon." With direct airline support, airline employees will know what steps to follow to get a lost item such as luggage back to its owner with the help of &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
United Airlines, for example, has created an entire workflow for reporting a bag that has an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a>. If a bag does not arrive, customers can file a delayed baggage report, and those that have an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; can add a Share Item Location link to the report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/united-airlines-shared-item-location.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981924" /><br/>
United customer service airlines are able to see the Share Item Location link and view the location of the item on an interactive map. United says that its employees will use the location to more quickly find delayed bags.<br/>
<br/>
Airlines that plan to implement support for Shared Item Location for lost or mishandled bags include Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eurowings, Iberia, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines, Turkish Airlines, United, Virgin Atlantic, and Vueling.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/ios-18-2-find-my-share-item-location/">iOS 18.2 Includes New Find My Option for Sharing Lost Luggage Location With Airlines</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-2-includes-new-find-my-option-for-sharing-lost-luggage-location-with-airlines.2445287/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-xr/">today announced</a> the launch of <a href="https://developer.android.com/develop/xr">Android XR</a>, an operating system created for extended reality (XR) headsets and smart glasses. Android XR is Google's equivalent of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/android-xr.jpg" alt="" width="1599" height="899" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981964" /><br/>
Android XR is designed for the "next generation of computing," and Google has teamed up with Samsung for the operating system. Google is providing a preview of Android XR to developers as of today, allowing them to start building apps and games for future Android XR devices that will compete with the Vision Pro and VR headsets from Meta.<br/>
<br/>
The first headset that runs Android XR will be designed by Samsung, and it is set to launch in 2025. Android XR and Samsung's headset will support being fully immersed in a virtual environment or staying present in the real world, similar to how Apple allows &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; users to adjust the Vision Pro immersion level by activating or shutting out the real world view provided by cameras.<br/>
<br/>
Android XR will include Gemini, Google's AI assistant, and it will offer device controls and insight into what the wearer is seeing. Google says that Gemini will be able to help users plan, research topics, and get task guidance. YouTube will be available to watch on a "virtual big screen," and Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> will support 3D images. An immersive view will be available for Google Maps, and Chrome will support multiple virtual screens for multitasking.<br/>
<br/>
Google says that mobile and tablet apps from Google Play will work with Android XR "right out of the box," with more immersive content made for XR coming in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
As for smart glasses, Android XR will provide one-tap access to Google Gemini. Google is planning to test prototype glasses running Android XR with a small group of users in the near future.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/google-android-xr-operating-system/">Google Debuts Android XR Operating System for Mixed Reality Headsets and Smart Glasses</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-debuts-android-xr-operating-system-for-mixed-reality-headsets-and-smart-glasses.2445280/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube today sent out emails to YouTube TV subscribers, letting them know about an upcoming price increase for the service. Starting on January 13, 2025, YouTube TV will cost &#36;82.99 per month for the base plan, up from &#36;72.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/youtube-tv.jpg" alt="" width="1100" height="619" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-841452" /><br/>
Prices are increasing so that YouTube can "keep up with the rising cost of content" and investments in the quality of its service. YouTube says that it is committed to bringing features like unlimited DVR storage and multiview to customers.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube TV subscribers can expect their YouTube TV Base Plan subscription prices to go up in their first billing cycle on or after January 13, 2025. Customers that are on a trial or a promotional price for the Base Plan will have the promotion honored with no changes.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube TV is YouTube's live television subscription offering that shows live TV programming. While the base plan is now &#36;82.99, subscribers can also add on 4K viewing for an additional &#36;9.99, premium channels starting at &#36;1.99 per month, NFL RedZone for &#36;10.99 per month, Spanish TV for &#36;14.99 per month, and Max, Paramount+, Showtime, and Starz for &#36;29.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
At launch in 2018, YouTube TV was priced at just &#36;35 per month, but pricing went up to &#36;50 per month in 2019. In 2020, YouTube TV's price was raised to &#36;64.99, and it went up to &#36;72.99 in 2023.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's website <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">continues to state</a> that the first vehicle models with support for next-generation CarPlay will "arrive in 2024," but with less than three weeks remaining in the year, time is running short for the company to meet that objective.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2015/02/carplay-next-gen-hero.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969129" /><br/>
One reason to remain optimistic is that a similar situation played out last year. Apple said the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay would be previewed in late 2023, and while that seemed more and more unlikely as the year-end approached, Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">finally shared some dashboard concepts</a> on December 20. Just in time!<br/>
<br/>
That's all we have, so far, though. Concepts, leaks, and promises.<br/>
<br/>
Aston Martin last year said next-generation CarPlay would be available in its DB12 sports car, but it has not shared any specific plans. Meanwhile, Porsche told us it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/26/porsche-no-next-generation-carplay-in-near-term/">no imminent plans to launch next-generation CarPlay</a> as of late November.<br/>
<br/>
It has now been more than two and a half years since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">first announced next-generation CarPlay</a> at WWDC 2022, and it has yet to launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not publicly commented on next-generation CarPlay in a long time, but it has continued to make preparations behind the scenes. Last month, for example, a few redesigned next-generation CarPlay icons <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/ios-18-2-beta-next-generation-carplay-icons/">appeared in iOS 18.2 code</a>. However, iOS 18.2 was released earlier this week, and there is still no sign of the new CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1540" height="854" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927564" /><br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/next-generation-carplay-images-in-eu/">filed to protect its next-generation CarPlay designs</a> in the European Union last month.<br/>
<br/>
When it first announced next-generation CarPlay a few years ago, Apple promised deeper integration with the instrument cluster and climate controls, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, a dedicated FM radio app, widgets, and more. The interface would be tailored to each vehicle model and automaker's brand identity.<br/>
<br/>
Next-generation CarPlay is expected to be available in new vehicles only. It will not be an update for standard CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes it:<blockquote>This next generation of CarPlay is the ultimate iPhone experience for the car. It provides content for all the driver's screens including the instrument cluster. This ensures a cohesive design experience that is the very best of your car and your iPhone — with designs for each automaker that express your vehicle’s character and brand. Vehicle functions like radio and temperature controls are handled right from CarPlay. And personalization options ranging from widgets to selecting curated gauge cluster designs make it unique to the driver.</blockquote>During its initial announcement, Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Aston Martin was announced later. It is unclear if that list remains accurate, however, as some automakers have since expressed hesitation about ceding the in-vehicle software experience to Apple. That doesn't guarantee that next-generation CarPlay is dead in the water, but the list of partners could end up being smaller.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Vehicle-Software-Update.jpg" alt="" width="1574" height="782" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954816" /><br/>
Apple has not responded to our several requests for comment about next-generation CarPlay this year, but as of now its website still promises a 2024 launch. Apple and car makers have 19 days remaining to pull off the feat within that timeframe.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated Pages, Numbers, and Keynote for Mac and iOS with support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features like ChatGPT <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> integration, Writing Tools, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a> that were largely introduced in iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iWork-macOS-Trio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818315" /><br/>
All three apps support Writing Tools for proofreading, summarizing, rewriting, and composing text, with the latter feature relying on ChatGPT. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is able to use ChatGPT to answer questions about what's in presentations, documents, and spreadsheets. <br/>
<br/>
Pages, Numbers, and Keynote also offer &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; support, so there is now an option to create original images that can be used in iWork documents. <br/>
<br/>
All of the new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features require a device that's capable of &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;. That includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models, all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, Macs with an Apple silicon chip, iPads with an Apple silicon chip, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/">iPad mini 7</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's iWork apps for iOS devices and Macs are free to download and use. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iwork/">iWork</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/keynote/">Keynote</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/numbers/">Numbers</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pages/">Pages</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-iwork-apps-apple-intelligence/">Keynote, Pages, and Numbers Get Apple Intelligence Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/keynote-pages-and-numbers-get-apple-intelligence-features.2445266/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anker recently kicked off a big <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fchristmas-sale%3Fref%3Dhomepage_masterBanner_1">holiday sale</a>, which is set to run through Christmas day. This sale includes notable discounts on portable chargers, USB-C hubs, cables, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/anker-holiday-sale.jpeg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981950" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Anker. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
There are a few bonus offers during this event as well, including festive gift bundles aimed at family members, friends, and co-workers. If you enter your email on the sale's landing page, you can unwrap a mystery gift that includes either a portable battery or up to a 20 percent off coupon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fchristmas-sale%3Fref%3Dhomepage_masterBanner_1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">SITEWIDE SALE</div>Anker Holiday Sale</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
This sale also includes some Amazon discounts, with a new all-time low price on the popular 60,000 mAh Power Station with Smart Digital Display and Retractable Lighting. You can get this accessory for just <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-PowerCore-Portable-Retractable-Emergency%2Fdp%2FB0BV23LTXZ%3Fth%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a> with an on-page coupon this week, down from &#36;139.99.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-PowerCore-Portable-Retractable-Emergency%2Fdp%2FB0BV23LTXZ%3Fth%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;60 OFF</div>Anker Power Station with Display and Lantern for &#36;79.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Finally, it's worth noting that MacRumors readers can still get <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2F%3Fref%3DnaviMenu">20 percent off Anker accessories</a> through the end of the year. Anker's current holiday event beats this discount most of the time, but if you find a product not on sale it will be worth entering our code at checkout.<br/>
<br/>
In order to get this deal, head to Anker's website and add an accessory to your cart, then enter the code <strong>akmacrumors20ch</strong> at checkout to see the discount. Our exclusive 20 percent off code works on most accessories sitewide, including Anker's new line of MagSafe-compatible products. Our code does not stack with any existing offers, including the holiday deals.<br/>
