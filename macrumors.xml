		<description><![CDATA[WWDC is coming up quickly with a number of software announcements in store, but we're also looking further ahead to hardware launches like the iPhone 17 lineup and even Apple's smart glasses project.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/top-stories-2025-05-24.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002773" /><br/>
This week also saw big news with former Apple design guru Jony Ive joining forces with OpenAI to build future AI-driven devices, while Fortnite returned to the U.S. App Store for the first time since 2020 amid the long-running dispute between Apple and Epic Games, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 17 Air Battery Capacity and Weight Allegedly Revealed</h2><br/>
Apple is expected to launch an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air later this year, and while there have been plenty of rumors about the camera's overall design and thinness, we haven't heard any details about the device's weight and battery capacity until now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Air-Pastel-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999629" /><br/>
According to the leaker going by the account name "yeux1122" on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/iphone-17-air-battery-capacity-revealed/">the 6.6-inch iPhone 17 Air has a weight of approximately 145 grams</a>, which is similar to that of an iPhone SE or iPhone 13 mini.<br/>
<br/>
The leaker also claims the battery capacity of an iPhone 17 Air production sample is 2,800mAh, similar to that of the iPhone 12, though Apple reportedly may be able to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/iphone-17-air-advanced-silicon-battery/">new high-density battery technology</a> that could boost capacity by 15%.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces WWDC 2025 Schedule, Including Keynote Time</h2><br/>
With WWDC now less just over two weeks away, Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/apple-announces-wwdc-2025-schedule/">announced some additional details for the developer conference</a>, including that the keynote will kick off on Monday, June 9, at the usual time of 10:00 a.m. Pacific. The Platforms State of the Union will follow at 1:00 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/wwdc-2025-arch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002295" /><br/>
Apple will also be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/wwdc-2025-labs-and-community-events/">hosting a variety of group and one-on-one labs</a> during the week of primarily virtual events, while the company is promoting related community events that will be taking place around WWDC.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Smart Glasses: Everything We Know So Far</h2><br/>
At its I/O conference this week, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/google-android-xr-smart-glasses/">Google showed off a set of lightweight smart glasses</a> with deep Gemini integration that will rival the Meta Ray-Ban glasses and Apple's rumored future smart glasses, so we thought it would be worth <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/21/apple-smart-glasses-everything-we-know-so-far/">taking a look at the state of the rumors on Apple's project</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/Apple-Glass.png" alt="" width="1200" height="676" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-742565" /><br/>
Apple's initial smart glasses reportedly won't offer a full augmented reality experience, but they will offer AI capabilities, microphones, and cameras to support capturing photos and video and features similar to visual intelligence on Apple's latest iPhone models that can look up information on the world around you. Apple's first glasses <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/apple-smart-glasses-launching-in-2026/">could arrive by the end of 2026</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Report: Apple's Next-Gen Version of Siri Is 'On Par' With ChatGPT</h2><br/>
Amid a delayed launch for Apple Intelligence-powered Siri enhancements, Apple is looking even further ahead at what it can do to make Siri more competitive with ChatGPT and other chatbots. According to a report, Apple's "LLM Siri" is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/next-gen-siri-is-on-par-with-chatgpt/">already considered "on par" with ChatGPT internally</a>, but it's going to take a few years to fully swap out the existing "hybrid" architecture of Siri with this new "monolithic model."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/siri-to-take-a-backseat-at-wwdc/">Siri will reportedly take a backseat at WWDC</a> next month as Apple focuses on other Apple Intelligence advances. And in general, Apple is said to be planning to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/18/apple-to-cut-down-on-early-announcements/">more cautious going forward about announcing new features that aren't ready to ship</a>, seeking to avoid a repeat of the Siri situation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>macOS 16: Everything We Know So Far</h2><br/>
Apple will be taking the wraps off of macOS 16 and other updates in just a few weeks at WWDC, so we've <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/macos-16-everything-we-know-so-far/">taken a look at what we're expecting to see with the next major update for the Mac</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/macOS-16-visionOS-Inspired-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994383" /><br/>
Some design changes seem likely amid rumors that Apple is seeking to create a more consistent interface across its product lines, with some of the inspiration reportedly coming from visionOS. We're also expecting Google Gemini integration as an alternative to ChatGPT, a number of accessibility improvements, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>OpenAI Buys Jony Ive's AI Startup to 'Completely Reimagine What It Means to Use a Computer'</h2><br/>
Former Apple design chief Jony Ive and several other Apple design team alumni are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/21/openai-buys-jony-ive-ai-startup/">teaming up with OpenAI in an attempt to build an all-new family of AI-driven devices</a> to revolutionize the way we interact with technology.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/jony-ive-sam-altman.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002771" /><br/>
OpenAI has acquired Ive's startup by the name of io for &#36;6.5 billion, and they're aiming to create an unobtrusive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/jony-ive-openai-product-third-core-device/">"third core device"</a> that people would likely use alongside a phone and a laptop, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/ming-chi-kuo-on-openai-device-design/">may look something like a neck-worn iPod shuffle</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Fortnite Returns to U.S. App Store</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/fortnite-returns-to-u-s-app-store/">Popular game Fortnite is once again available in the U.S. App Store</a>, as Apple has finally approved Epic Games' app submission. This is the first time that Fortnite has been on the iOS ‌App Store‌ since 2020, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/21/fortnite-app-store-top-charts/">quickly went to the top of the App Store charts</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite_apple_featured.jpg" alt="" width="2140" height="1204" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-754674" /><br/>
Apple initially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/apple-fortnite-ios-not-blocked-worldwide/">did not plan to allow Fortnite back in the ‌App Store‌</a>, but the judge overseeing the ongoing legal battle between the two companies this week suggested that Apple and ‌Epic Games‌ work things out or face more time in court. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/apple-fortnite-us-app-store-dispute/">judge threatened</a> to require the Apple official that oversees app decisions to appear in person in court, which apparently was enough to spur Apple to allow the game back on the ‌App Store‌.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Sony recently came out with a new set of high-end over-ear noise canceling headphones, so we thought we'd compare them to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> to see how Sony's 2025 headphones measure up to Apple's headphones that haven't seen a notable update since their 2020 launch.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfmMDb4RQ_g" title="Sony WH1000XM6 vs AirPods Max: A CLEAR Winner?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The WH-1000XM6 headphones are the latest in Sony's WH-1000X headphone series, and Sony hasn't gotten better at naming in the three years since the prior-generation WH-1000XM5 headphones came out. Sony increased the price when it launched the XM5 headphones in 2022, and the price is going up again. The XM6 headphones <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-17086682">are now &#36;450</a>, which isn't too far off of the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; price <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized%2Fdp%2FB0DGJC52FP">if you get them on sale</a>. Apple's retail price is still &#36;549, but Amazon and other retailers often sell them for less.<br/>
<br/>
With the XM5, Sony did away with the option to fold the ear cups in, but that's been reversed with the XM6. The ear cups do fold, so the XM6 headphones are more portable than the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, which do not fold. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; "case" has been derided for years for its silly, non-protective design, and the XM6 have a much better case. Sony's case has a pleasing, rounded design with hardshell protection for the headphones and a slim fit thanks to the folding design. There's a little pocket inside to hold a USB-C cable for charging, and to make the headphones easier to access, the case is magnetic instead of using a zipper.<br/>
<br/>
Apple still wins when it comes to design because of the aluminum build of the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, but the XM6 headphones are more comfortable to wear for long periods of time since they're lighter.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; have always had excellent sound quality, but the XM6 also sound great. Sony's headphones have an advantage because there is an option to adjust the EQ and fine tune sound through the Sound Connect app.<br/>
<br/>
Both sets of headphones are about equal when it comes to Active Noise Cancellation, though the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; may have a bit of an edge. It's impressive that Apple's 2020 ANC is on par with 2025 ANC from Sony. The XM6 headphones have a Transparency mode like the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, so you can have sound cut through when needed. Transparency works well on the XM6, coming close to the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; transparency. There's also a Background Noise option that plays music at a low level so you can still carry on conversations.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life has improved since Apple released the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, and the XM6 headphones last for up to 30 hours with ANC on. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; only last for up to 20 hours with ANC active. Both the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; and the XM6 charge over USB-C, but &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; also use USB-C for wired connectivity. On the XM6, there's a wired option, but you need to use a 3.5mm audio cable.<br/>
<br/>
Music controls are swipe-based, so you need to swipe to change the volume and swap tracks. Sony did put a physical off button on the XM6 headphones, which isn't something that's available with the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; have benefits in the Apple ecosystem like instant connection and fast device swapping, and that's something that's lacking with the Sony headphones. If you have a lot of Apple products and don't mind the weight of the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, you might prefer them to the XM6. If you're not swapping devices often and prefer a more comfortable fit, the XM6 are the better headphones.<br/>

		<title>Nanoleaf EXPO Case Review: Fun LED Display Boxes for Sneakers and Collectibles</title>

		<description><![CDATA[If you have a collection that you want to show off, whether it's high-end sneakers, expensive collectible vinyl figures, or something else you want to draw attention to, Nanoleaf's <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/nanoleaf-expo-display-case/?pack=smarter-kit&amp;size=4">EXPO Smart LED Display Cases</a> are worth checking out. They're priced at &#36;270 for a pack of four, with additional expansion cases available for &#36;63.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/nanoleaf-display-case-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961157" /><br/>
The EXPO Smart Cases are LED equipped display boxes for collectibles. They're rectangular, with white plastic sides and clear plastic at the front and the back. The front panel opens up so that items can be placed inside.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/nanoelaf-expo-case-close-up.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1255" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002794" /><br/>
In terms of size and shape, they remind me of the shoe boxes that people get to store their sneakers. They're just under 15 inches long, 11.4 inches deep, and 8.7 inches tall. The inside measurements are a bit smaller, so you have about 7.5 inches in height. The height has been the most limiting factor in my testing, since taller collectible items won't fit inside. For shoes, which these cases are definitely designed for, you can fit up to a size 15 sneaker. Nanoleaf <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/nanoleaf-expo-display-case/get-started/faq/">has a guide</a> on what other kinds of things fit inside, but there isn't a mention of a weight limit. Most collectibles that will fit aren't wildly heavy, and the cases are sturdy, so weight probably won't be a concern for most people.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/nanoelaf-expo-case-side-view.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002782" /><br/>
These ship in flat-packed, and each box has to be assembled one-by-one. The pieces only go together one way and it's not terribly hard to get them put together, but it did take me a good half hour to set up four of them. I found setting them up to be somewhat frustrating because it takes more force than you might think to get them to snap in place.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/nanoelaf-expo-case-open.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1228" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002783" /><br/>
Once assembled, they feel sturdy, even though they're made of plastic. They don't look or feel cheap, but it is clear that they're plastic and not another material. Nanoleaf only makes the EXPO Cases in white, and that isn't going to fit some aesthetics. I suspect there are a lot of collectors who might prefer black, but the white does work well for highlighting the items inside. Either way, the assembly keeps what's inside dust free, but Nanoleaf doesn't mention UV protection so I assume that's not included.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/nanoelaf-expo-case-white.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002784" /><br/>
Like Nanoleaf's lighting panels, the EXPO Cases link together with connectors, which are included in the box. There's a main controller box that provides power and that the power adapter plugs into, and the rest of the boxes plug into it. Nanoleaf designed them to be set up all in one row or stacked up, so you can actually make several different designs. There isn't any wall mounting hardware, so they're designed more to go on the floor or on a surface like a desk or a shelf.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/nanoelaf-expo-case-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002785" /><br/>
The controller box has a set of touch-based controls on it for changing the colors and the brightness without the app, and I hate them. They use touch activation instead of physical buttons. The buttons are too sensitive, and if you even brush them, they activate. They're also somewhat annoying for actions like resetting the EXPO Cases. I would have preferred standard physical buttons.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/nanoelaf-expo-case-green.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002793" /><br/>
I set the cases up across a set of bookcases in my office in a horizontal line, but I also tested them in a two row vertical orientation, and they stack well. There's an indentation at the top of each box that the base of a second box sits in for a secure fit, but there's no clip or other mechanism that holds them in place other than surface area and the indentations. I wanted to be able to put LEGO that I have on top of the cases, but the depressions would have made for an unstable surface, which is something to keep in mind if you want to have something on top. I added some craft foam to have a flat surface, and that ended up working well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/nanoelaf-expo-case-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002786" /><br/>
I have seven cases to fit across my bookcase, but up to 300 can be connected together. Once you have over eight cases, you need a 75W power supply unit from Nanoleaf, which I believe is sold separately because the base kits ship with a 42W power supply. A 75W power supply supports 14 cases, so if you go over that number, you'll need two or more power supplies. Note that while 300 can be connected, Nanoleaf says you should only stack them 16 high vertically. There's no limitation in a horizontal orientation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/nanoelaf-expo-case-rainbow.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002787" /><br/>
The EXPO Cases connect to the Nanoleaf app, and are HomeKit-enabled, so you can access them in the Home app and control them with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. Thread is included too, for improved connectivity. Like other Nanoleaf products, they can be set to over 16 million colors, with different patterns and light sequences that are available in the app. I like Nanoleaf's app, and I think the company has done a good job making it easy to get a whole range of different scenes and color options for its products with little effort.<br/>

You can set the EXPO Cases to solid colors or create your own animated scenes in the app, but there are also community created scenes and AI Magic Scenes. With community scenes, you can download a lot of really great color/pattern combos created by others, and the AI Magic Scene lets you put in any phrase to have AI come up with something. There's an option to create a playlist to have the EXPO Cases cycle through scenes, and there is a rhythm option, which allows the selected colors to shift in time with music that's playing. You can also connect them to a PC or Mac setup with other Nanoleaf lights using the Nanoleaf desktop app.<br/>
<br/>

There are multiple shades of white in addition to color, which I think is important for the EXPO Cases. Depending on what you have inside, some of the deeper colors and the animations can make the contents hard to focus on. If I'm showing off collectibles, I generally like them to be visible, so I have been setting the EXPO Cases to lighter colors and shades of white (1200K to 6500K). The deep colors do look nice with sneakers or more simple items, and the backlighting is definitely eye-catching.<br/>
<br/>

You can select a brightness level for the cases along with a color, and they get fairly bright. Nanoleaf says they're each 50 lumens, and I usually have them on half brightness or lower.<br/>
<br/>

I don't want to do a Nanoleaf review without addressing connectivity and customer service, two areas where Nanoleaf has historically struggled. Older Nanoleaf products can have issues, and I've had controllers fail on the Aurora and Canvas panels. The newer Thread-enabled products seem to be more reliable so far, and I've tested the EXPO Cases since last August with only one connectivity hiccup during setup. They haven't disconnected from Wi-Fi since, and the Nanoleaf Skylights I've had set up since last year have also been stable. My only recent issue was with the Sense+ Switch intermittently disconnecting, but it's been okay for a couple months now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/nanoelaf-expo-case-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002791" /><br/>
As for my customer service experience, I needed a seventh box and I bought it directly from Nanoleaf. They mistakenly sent me a controller case instead of an expansion case, so I got in touch with support as a regular customer. I got a reply back quickly, and received a replacement. I've seen Nanoleaf support being more active on various social channels like Reddit recently, so I think they're trying to improve. I am hoping that newer products are going to have a longer life than some of the older devices with fewer connectivity issues, but time will tell.<br/>
<br/>
Nanoleaf's EXPO Cases come with a two-year warranty and a 30-day return period (when purchased from the Nanoleaf website).<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
Nanoleaf's EXPO Cases were clearly designed for showing off high-end sneaker collections given the shape and size, but they work well for any small collectible. They pair up with other Nanoleaf lights and make for a great desk accessory, room decoration, or ambient light source.<br/>
<br/>
It's nice to have an ambient lighting option that also has some utility, and Nanoleaf's EXPO cases are a solid alternative to adding LED lights to a standard display case or curio cabinet. I didn't love the physical buttons and I wish there were more color options for those who don't love white, but overall, it's a solid product that's unique and has value for collectors.<br/>
<br/>
I do think these are on the expensive side at around &#36;67 per case, but the target audience for these likely spends a lot more on what goes inside the cases.<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2><br/>
The Nanoleaf EXPO Smart LED Display Cases can <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/nanoleaf-expo-display-case/?pack=smarter-kit&amp;size=4">be purchased from the Nanoleaf website</a> or from Amazon for &#36;270, which includes a set of four cases. Additional cases are available for &#36;63.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's highest-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/">M3 Ultra chip</a> is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">limited to the Mac Studio</a>, but a new leak has revealed that Apple tested the chip in the MacBook Pro as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974025" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/opus/1070156196370972711">post today</a> on the Chinese social media platform BiliBili, a user who we are not familiar with said that they found code references to unreleased 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 Ultra chip, in an internal build of iOS 18 running on an iPhone 16 engineering prototype. Specifically, they said that they found J514d and J516d codenames in a file located in the /AppleInternal/Diags/Tests/ folder.<br/>
<br/>
J514 and J516 are the codenames for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, which were introduced by Apple in October 2023. However, these particular codenames have a "d" suffix, which likely refers to an Ultra chip. For example, the Mac Studio with the M3 Ultra is codenamed J575d.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has never released a MacBook Pro with an Ultra chip, so this is a noteworthy discovery.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the M3 Ultra is the fastest Mac chip that Apple has ever released. It features up to a 32-core CPU, up to an 80-core GPU, and support for up to 512GB of unified memory, so those could have been MacBook Pro specs in an alternate universe.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, Apple updated the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-macbook-pro-models/">with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chip options</a> in October last year. Apple most likely decided not to make the M3 Ultra chip available in the MacBook Pro, potentially due to greater thermal and battery life impacts for laptops compared to desktop computers.<br/>
<br/>
With the M4 Max, the MacBook Pro can be configured with up to a 16-core CPU, up to a 40-core GPU, and up to 128GB of unified memory.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it appears that Apple at least considered MacBook Pro models with the M3 Ultra chip, but it is unlikely that they will ever be released.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">MacBook Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/ios-18-leak-macbook-pro-m3-ultra-chip/">iOS 18 Leak Reveals Apple Tested MacBook Pros With M3 Ultra Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-leak-reveals-apple-tested-macbook-pros-with-m3-ultra-chip.2457597/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared several new short video ads on its UK YouTube channel, highlighting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> features like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Ceramic Shield, Stolen Device Protection, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iPhone Find My Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5BXmfQfqlY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Each ad is about 13 seconds in length, and they are all text-based, providing little tidbits of information about the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s capabilities. For the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; ad, for example, Apple focuses on parents and children. "&zwnj;Find My&zwnj; on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lets you view your kid's location if you need to," it reads.<br/>
<br/>
The Stolen Device Protection video reminds people that additional &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; security is available. "Stolen Device Protection adds extra layers of security for your Apple Account if your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is lost or taken."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iPhone Stolen Device Protection Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FcIFvzP8-mg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
For the Ceramic Shield ad, Apple compares it to traditional smartphone glass. "Our Ceramic Shield material on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> is 2x tougher than any smartphone glass."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iPhone Ceramic Shield Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rh-s5CtbASw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; ad highlights Apple's review process, and how it cuts down on malware. "Every app on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; is scanned for malware through automated and human review so your device stays secure."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iPhone App Store Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dyXqDm4Exwg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Each ad ends with the tagline "There's more to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;," and they link to Apple's "More" &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; page that highlights a range of different things the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can do.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwIJ3ClHW0FCqTDsYdMAY5dRWYwmou01F">shared videos</a> in this style before, and these short ads will likely be shown in short YouTube ad spots and on social networks.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/apple-ads-key-iphone-features/">Apple&#039;s Latest Ads Show Off Key iPhone Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-latest-ads-show-off-key-iphone-features.2457596/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Kuo: Apple Better Off Taking 25% Tariff Hit Than Move iPhone Production to US</title>

		<description><![CDATA[It would be more financially viable for Apple to absorb a 25% import tariff on iPhones sold in the United States than to relocate its assembly operations to the U.S., Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> today said.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Logo-Spotlight-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915203" /><br/>
Kuo, a respected analyst with a long track record of accurate forecasts about Apple's supply chain, made the <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1925904346450915799">statement on X</a> (formerly Twitter) in response to renewed pressure from former President Donald Trump for Apple to shift <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> production to the United States. The comment follows President Trump's threat to impose a 25% tariff on all iPhones not assembled domestically.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>In terms of profitability, it's way better for Apple to take the hit of a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the US market than to move iPhone assembly lines back to [the] US.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The analysis alludes to the scale and complexity of Apple's current manufacturing infrastructure, which is deeply rooted in Asia — particularly China and, increasingly, India. Apple relies on an extensive network of suppliers and contract manufacturers such as Foxconn and Pegatron, all of which operate large-scale facilities tailored specifically to Apple's production requirements. These partnerships are supported by decades of logistical refinement and allow Apple to produce iPhones at a volume and cost efficiency that would be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate in the United States under current conditions.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. plays a relatively limited role in the physical assembly of iPhones, despite being one of Apple's most critical markets. While some components, such as glass from Corning, are American in origin, final &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; assembly occurs almost entirely overseas. Moving this process stateside would require multibillion-dollar investments in infrastructure, labor, and training, with no guarantee of replicating the scale, cost structure, or speed of existing operations in Asia.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reportedly plans to shift a majority of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; production for the U.S. market to India by 2026. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple intends to source more than 60 million iPhones annually from Indian factories over the next two years. Foxconn, Apple's primary assembly partner, is currently investing &#36;1.5 billion in new manufacturing infrastructure in India. President Trump <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/trump-us-iphone-production/">posted on Truth Social</a> earlier today: <blockquote>I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your [sic] for your attention to this matter!</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Such a tariff would be unprecedented in scope and could lead to a significant increase in retail prices for iPhones sold in the United States. Wedbush Securities recently estimated that shifting &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; production to the United States could increase the per-unit cost of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to approximately &#36;3,500.<br/>
<br/>
With the U.S. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user base estimated at over 120 million and annual U.S. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; shipments exceeding 60 million units, even a 25% tariff would represent a smaller financial burden than the capital expenditures and operational challenges required to replicate its Asian supply chain in America. Apple's shares fell 3% in pre-market trading following the President's comments.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-states/">United States</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/apple-better-off-taking-tariff-hit/">Kuo: Apple Better Off Taking 25% Tariff Hit Than Move iPhone Production to US</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-better-off-taking-25-tariff-hit-than-move-iphone-production-to-us.2457591/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_QpeOz197s?si=njf4ecgfaMxBbxhW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
At its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/google-i-o-announcements/">I/O 2025 conference</a>, Google unveiled a wide range of artificial intelligence enhancements surrounding its Gemini AI platform. Chief among these is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/google-launches-dedicated-ai-mode-in-search/">dedicated AI Mode for Google Search</a>, which leverages contextual understanding to return more relevant, nuanced results and allows follow-up questions. Within Google Chrome, Gemini has also been integrated to assist with summarizing web content, composing messages, and providing intelligent suggestions. Gemini Agent Mode is designed to be an autonomous assistant that completes tasks on your behalf, while Gemini Personal Context pulls from your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and more to offer personalized, proactive help.<br/>
<br/>
Google introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/google-gemini-live-ios-app/">Gemini Live</a>, which brings real-time AI assistance to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users. The feature supports screen sharing, camera access, and integration with services like Google Calendar and Maps. The company also devoted time to generative models: Veo 3 for video generation, Imagen 4 for image synthesis, and Deep Research, a tool designed to provide thorough, AI-powered insights across complex subjects.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Google introduced significant developments in wearable computing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/google-android-xr-smart-glasses/">with Android XR</a>, a new operating system designed specifically for augmented reality headsets and smart glasses. The platform gains features like live translation, turn-by-turn directions, and real-time contextual support powered by Gemini. Samsung will be the first partner to release a headset running Android XR later this year, followed by a smart glasses product.<br/>
<br/>
Google's own smart glasses initiative was also showcased. The new glasses are equipped with in-lens displays, microphones, speakers, and cameras, allowing users to see and hear the world with real-time assistance from Gemini. The glasses will be designed in partnership with eyewear brands Gentle Monster and Warby Parker.<br/>
<br/>
In other news, OpenAI this week set out <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/21/openai-buys-jony-ive-ai-startup/">plans to acquire io</a>, a hardware startup co-founded by legendary former Apple design chief Jony Ive, in a deal valued at approximately &#36;6.5 billion. The acquisition brings a team of influential former Apple designers, including Evans Hankey and Marc Newson, into OpenAI. The company is working on developing a new category of device described as a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/jony-ive-openai-product-third-core-device/">third core device</a>," envisioned to complement the smartphone and laptop without replicating either.<br/>
<br/>
The new hardware is neither a phone nor a pair of glasses, but a compact, screenless device designed to sit on a desk or in a pocket. Unlike legacy devices, it apparently seeks to reduce dependence on screens and offer more ambient, contextual interactions with AI. According to reports, the device is aware of its surroundings through microphones and cameras, and integrates tightly with a user's life while remaining unobtrusive. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has described the product as "the coolest piece of technology the world will have ever seen."<br/>
<br/>
Development of the product remains highly secretive. Comparisons have been made to the Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin, but the involvement of Jony Ive and his team designing around OpenAI's industry-leading technology suggests that this product could be different. The device is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/ming-chi-kuo-on-openai-device-design/">revealed in late 2026</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On iPhone and iPad, Apple's screen recording feature records a video of what you're doing on your screen, which is great if you want to capture gameplay, walk someone through a tutorial in an app, demonstrate a bug, or anything else. You can also include a voiceover in screen recordings. Keep reading to learn how.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-Home-Screen-Gradient.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943009" /><br/>
If you're making a screen recording to demonstrate something in iOS, chances are it would benefit from some voiceover commentary. Fortunately, Apple enables you to do this by activating your device's microphone for the duration of the recording. <br/>
<br/>
To record your voice along with screen activity, simply follow these steps.<br/>
<ol><li>Invoke the Control Center by swiping down diagonally from the top-right corner of the screen.</li><br/>
<li>Long press the <strong>Screen Recording button </strong>in Control Center (if it isn't there, you can add the function via <strong>Settings -> Control Center</strong>).<br/>

<li>Tap the <strong>Microphone button</strong> so that it turns red and reads "Microphone On."</li><br/>
<li>Select an app from the list that you want to save the recording to.</li><br/>
<li>When you're ready, tap <strong>Start Recording</strong>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[President Donald Trump escalated his trade rhetoric Friday, targeting Apple with a potential 25% tariff unless the company manufactures iPhones domestically rather than anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-iPhone-16-family-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996656" /><br/>
The warning came via Truth Social after CEO Tim Cook announced earlier this month that Indian facilities would handle the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/">majority</a> of U.S. iPhone sales. Apple's pivot to India was widely seen as a strategy to sidestep Chinese manufacturing amid ongoing trade tensions.<br/>
<blockquote>"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else," Trump wrote. "If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your [sic] for your attention to this matter!"</blockquote>The U.S. president brought up the issue just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/trump-tells-apple-stop-building-iphones-india/">last week</a> during his Middle East trip. "I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday," Trump said during his state visit to Qatar. "He is building all over India."<br/>
<br/>
Apple had reportedly planned to source all 60+ million annual US iPhone sales <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/25/apple-source-us-bound-iphones-india-2026/">from India by late 2026</a>. Meanwhile, key supplier Foxconn is investing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/foxconn-pours-1-billion-into-india/">&#36;1.5 billion</a> to expand Indian production, including a display module facility near Chennai.<br/>
<br/>
The threat sent Apple shares tumbling 3% in pre-market trading Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Trump's demand would force a major shift from Apple's current manufacturing strategy, which relies heavily on Asian suppliers for cost efficiency and established supply chains. Moving iPhone production to the U.S. would likely require massive infrastructure investments and could substantially increase device costs, but there's simply no way Apple could pull off the transition. According to Wedbush, producing iPhones in the U.S. could push prices to ~&#36;3,500 and take 5–10 years to implement, making it unfeasible.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/trump-us-iphone-production/">Trump Demands US iPhone Production, Threatens 25% Tariff</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/trump-demands-us-iphone-production-threatens-25-tariff.2457574/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[British fintech company <a href="https://www.curve.com/en-gb/">Curve</a> has launched contactless payments for iPhone users in the European Union, becoming the second third-party payment service after PayPal to take advantage of Apple's newly opened NFC interface (via <em><a href="https://www.iphone-ticker.de/curve-pay-der-naechste-apple-pay-konkurrent-startet-in-europa-257054/">iphone-ticker.de</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/curve-pay.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002620" /><br/>
The Curve Pay app allows users to make tap-to-pay purchases without using Apple Pay or the Wallet app, following PayPal's debut of similar functionality in Germany earlier this month. The feature was made possible by Europe's Digital Markets Act, which forced Apple to open its NFC chip to third-party developers.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike traditional wallet apps, Curve Pay operates as an independent payment authority rather than simply passing through stored card data. Users can reassign purchases to different cards after completing transactions and link various payment sources including PayPal accounts.<br/>
<br/>
The app also provides real-time spending analytics and automated cashback programs. Its "staged wallet" architecture also gives users more control over the payment process compared to conventional digital wallets.<br/>
<br/>
Curve claims more than six million users across its platform, which was previously available only on Android devices. The company joins PayPal in offering European iPhone users alternatives to Apple Pay, with German cooperative banks also planning to introduce their own NFC payment solution through their banking app this September.<br/>
<br/>
NFC access is available for banking and wallet apps in the European Economic Area, which includes the 27 European Union countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/">NFC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/curve-pay-launches-iphone-nfc-payments/">Curve Pay Launches iPhone NFC Payments as Apple Pay Alternative</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/curve-pay-launches-iphone-nfc-payments-as-apple-pay-alternative.2457569/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A new Apple job listing has provided more evidence that the company is working on a major overhaul of its Calendar app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/General-Calendar-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-832026" /><br/>
A <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200590045/senior-software-engineer-calendar-experience">senior software engineer position</a> for "Calendar Experience," <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2791509/apple-job-posting-confirms-calendar-revamp.html">spotted</a> by <em>Macworld</em>'s Filipe Espósito, explicitly states that Apple seeks candidates to join a team that will "reimagine what a modern calendar can be across Apple's platforms." Listed on April 29, the posting is surely the clearest acknowledgment yet of Apple's Calendar ambitions.<br/>
<br/>
The job listing provides further context for Apple's acquisition of Mayday Labs in April 2024. Per our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/09/apple-acquired-mayday-labs/">report</a> earlier this month, the Canadian startup had developed an AI-powered calendar app that automatically scheduled events and tasks at optimal times.<br/>
<br/>
Mayday's features included a "Calendar Shield" that blocked overbooked schedules and AI-powered task scheduling that would suggest ideal focus times. The app could also identify scheduling conflicts and provide rescheduling recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
The Mayday app was shuttered shortly after the acquisition, suggesting the startup's AI capabilities could surface within Apple's own Calendar app under the Apple Intelligence umbrella.<br/>
<br/>
Over a year has passed since the acquisition, so perhaps some of these changes will debut as early as iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16, which will be unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC next month.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/apple-calendar-app-job-posting/">Apple Calendar App Revamp Confirmed by Job Posting</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-calendar-app-revamp-confirmed-by-job-posting.2457548/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/building-whats-next/">today said</a> that it is shutting down Pocket, the read-it-later service that allows users to save articles, videos, and webpages to view later. The company also plans to end work on Fakespot, a browser extension and website that analyzes the authenticity of online product reviews.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/pocket.jpg" alt="" width="1117" height="629" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002606" /><br/>
Pocket is a well-known service that streamlines articles, offering a distraction-free reading experience. It includes offline access, text-to-speech options, and tagging capabilities. Pocket has been integrated in Firefox since 2015, and Mozilla bought the service in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
Fakespot is an online review checking website that Mozilla bought two years ago and integrated into Firefox, but Mozilla said Fakespot "didn't fit a model [it] could sustain."<br/>
<br/>
Pocket is no longer available for download as of today, and there is no longer an option to purchase a Pocket Premium subscription. The Pocket shutdown will happen on July 8, 2025, and users will have until October 8, 2025 to export Pocket data before they are permanently deleted.<br/>
<br/>
Pocket Premium monthly and annual subscriptions will be canceled automatically, and annual subscribers will receive refunds after July 8. Access to the Pocket API will end on October 8, and data will need to be exported before then.<br/>
<br/>
Mozilla is shutting down the Fakespot extensions, mobile apps, and websites on July 1, 2025 and the Fakespot Review Checker in Firefox will shut down on June 10, 2025.<br/>
<br/>
According to Mozilla, while Pocket is popular and has over 10 million users, "the way people save and consume content on the web has evolved." As a result, the company plans to focus time and resources on Firefox, and develop projects that better match current browsing habits.<br/>
<br/>
Pocket users who are looking for an alternative have a number of options to consider, including Instapaper, Wallabag, and Raindrop.io.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mozilla/">Mozilla</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/mozilla-pocket-discontinued/">Firefox Maker Mozilla Discontinues Pocket and Fakespot to Focus on Browser</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/firefox-maker-mozilla-discontinues-pocket-and-fakespot-to-focus-on-browser.2457534/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Verizon Wants to Lock Phones Longer Like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Verizon wants to lock subscribers to its network for a longer period of time, and has asked the U.S. Federal Communications Commission [<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1051935705713">PDF</a>] to extend how long customers must wait before a Verizon smartphone can be unlocked and transferred to another carrier.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/verizon.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957071" /><br/>
Back when Verizon purchased 700MHz spectrum for its network in 2008, it agreed to unlock smartphones <a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/device-unlocking-policy/">after a 60-day period</a>. Verizon now wants the FCC to waive that requirement, allowing it to change its phone unlocking policy.<br/>
<br/>
Verizon claims that the 60-day unlocking requirement it is subject to leads to fraud and device trafficking. Verizon said it lost an estimated 784,703 devices to fraud in 2023, costing it "hundreds of millions of dollars." From Verizon's filing:<br/>
<blockquote>The Unlocking Rule applies only to particular providers -- mainly Verizon -- and distorts the marketplace in a critical U.S industry. The rule has resulted in unintended consequences that harm consumers, competition, and Verizon, while propping up international criminal organizations that profit from fraud, including device trafficking of subsidized devices from the United States. These bad actors target and harm American consumers and U.S. carriers like Verizon for their own profit, by diverting unlocked trafficked devices to consumers in foreign countries.</blockquote><br/>
Verizon suggests that consumers will benefit from the waiver because it will allow the company to better compete with other carriers by "offering subsidies and other mechanisms to make phones more affordable, lower upfront costs, and enable customers to obtain the latest and most innovative devices."<br/>
<br/>
Going forward, Verizon wants to be able to lock phones to its network for at least six months, putting it on par with other U.S. carriers. AT&amp;T locks prepaid devices to its network for six months and requires postpaid devices to be paid in full before they're unlocked, while T-Mobile locks prepaid devices to its network for 12 months, and also requires postpaid devices to be paid in full. Verizon is required to unlock prepaid and postpaid devices after 60 days.<br/>
<br/>
Under Biden, the FCC was considering a proposal that would require all carriers to unlock smartphones within a 60-day period, but as <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/verizon-tries-to-get-out-of-merger-condition-requiring-it-to-unlock-phones/">Ars Technica</a></em> notes, that effort might be dead under new FCC Chairman Brendan Carr because of his focus on deregulation.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/verizon/">Verizon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/verizon-smartphone-locking-change-petition/">Verizon Wants to Lock Phones Longer Like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/verizon-wants-to-lock-phones-longer-like-at-t-and-t-mobile.2457533/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is no longer planning to release an Apple Watch that includes a camera, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/apple-plans-glasses-for-2026-as-part-of-ai-push-nixes-watch-with-camera">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple was developing Apple Watch and Apple Watch Ultra models that had a camera to view the wearer's surrounding environment, but work on those projects ended this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965089" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-Jet-Black.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" /><br/>
The camera in the Apple Watch would not have been used for features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> or snapping photos, but instead would have allowed Apple Watch owners to get information about objects and places near them.<br/>
<br/>
An Apple Watch might have been able to do things like provide hours when pointed at a restaurant or store, identify a plant, describe an object, or offer language translations. The wearable camera functionality would have worked much like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a>, an AI <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> feature that lets users point their camera at something to get more information.<br/>
<br/>
Apple planned to release the camera-equipped Apple Watch models in 2027, but the plans are off. It's possible Apple could bring the technology back in the future, and it's not known why development ended.<br/>
<br/>
Though Apple is no longer planning for an Apple Watch with a camera, it's still developing AirPods with tiny cameras inside. The AirPods cameras may be infrared sensors to enable features like enhanced spatial audio, in-air gesture control, and AI capabilities.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/apple-watch-with-camera-canceled/">Apple Stops Work on Camera-Equipped Apple Watch Planned for 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-work-on-camera-equipped-apple-watch-planned-for-2027.2457528/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to launch a set of smart glasses by the end of 2026, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/apple-plans-glasses-for-2026-as-part-of-ai-push-nixes-watch-with-camera">Bloomberg</a></em>. The glasses will be comparable to the Meta Ray-Bans and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/google-android-xr-smart-glasses/">Android XR glasses</a> that Google showed off earlier this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/Apple-Glasses-Purple-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-777634" /><br/>
Apple's smart glasses are expected to include cameras, microphones, and AI capabilities, much like the Meta Ray-Bans. The glasses will be able to take photos, record video, provide translations, give turn-by-turn directions, play music, facilitate phone calls, offer feedback on what the wearer is seeing, and answer queries, but there won't be augmented reality capabilities included. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> will be a key part of the glasses experience, with Apple planning to improve the personal assistant ahead of when the product launches.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple targeting a late 2026 launch, work on the smart glasses has ramped up. Apple plans to produce "large quantities" of prototypes by the end of this year, giving the company time to test before mass production and a public unveiling.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, an Apple employee said that the glasses are similar to Meta's glasses, "but better made." The Meta Ray-Bans use Meta Llama and Google Gemini, but Apple will rely on its own AI models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's longtime goal has been a pair of lightweight augmented reality glasses, and the smart glasses that it is working on for 2026 will serve as a stepping stone. True augmented reality glasses are still years away as components like chips and batteries need to come down in price and size.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-glasses/">Apple Glasses</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/apple-smart-glasses-launching-in-2026/">Apple Smart Glasses Launching in 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-smart-glasses-launching-in-2026.2457524/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AI company Anthropic today announced the launch of two new Claude models, Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. Anthropic says that the models set "new standards for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI agents."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/claude-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002591" /><br/>
According to Anthropic, Claude Sonnet 4 is a significant upgrade to Claude Sonnet 3.7, offering improved coding and reasoning along with the ability to respond to instructions more precisely. Claude Opus 4 is designed for coding among other tasks, and it offers sustained performance for complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="A day with Claude" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqUclC3gqKs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Claude Opus 4 is Anthropic's most powerful model to date, and it is the world's best coding model with a 72.5 percent score on SWE-bench and 43.2 percent score on Terminal-bench. It can provide sustained performance over several hours on tasks that have thousands of steps.<br/>
<br/>
Claude Sonnet 4 is designed to balance performance and efficiency. It doesn't match Opus 4 for most domains, but Anthropic says that it is meant to provide an optimal mix of capability and practicality.<br/>
<br/>
Both models have a beta feature for extended thinking, and can use web search and other tools so that Claude can alternate between reasoning and tool use. Tools can be used in parallel, and the models have improved memory when provided with access to local files. Claude is able to save key facts to maintain continuity and build knowledge over time.<br/>
<br/>
Anthropic has cut down on behavior where the models use shortcuts or loopholes for completing tasks, and thinking summaries condense lengthy thought processes.<br/>
<br/>
Claude Code, an agentic coding tool that lives in terminal, is now widely available following testing. Claude Code supports background tasks with GitHub Actions and native integrations with VS Code and JetBrains, and it is able to edit files and fix bugs, answer questions about code, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Subscribers with Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise Claude plans have access to Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 starting today, while Sonnet 4 is available to free users. The models are available to developers on the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud Vertex AI. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/anthropic/">Anthropic</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/anthropic-launches-claude-4/">Claude 4 Debuts with Two New Models Focused on Coding and Reasoning</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/claude-4-debuts-with-two-new-models-focused-on-coding-and-reasoning.2457521/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Satechi, known for its range of accessories for Apple products, recently came out with a new series of OntheGo Wireless Chargers that are perfect for bringing along on trips due to their compact size.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002566" /><br/>
There are two models, a 3-in-1 charger and a 2-in-1 charger. The 3-in-1 option has a Qi2 charging surface for an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, an AirPods charger, and an Apple Watch charging puck. The 2-in-1 model drops the AirPods charger, so it has just the Qi2 charging platform and the Apple Watch charger. Depending on the AirPods you have, you can charge them via Qi2 or with an Apple Watch charger anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-onthego-charger-components.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002568" /><br/>
Each of the charging surfaces is a little bigger than Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charger, with the same circular shape. There's a small band connecting each one, and they stack on top of each other. The end result is a fold out multi-device charger that's super portable. It's under an inch and a half tall when folded up, and two and a half inches wide. The bands that connect each of the chargers feel sturdy and well-attached, and I wasn't able to budge them when pulling on them with force. I think they will hold up decently over time with regular use. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-onthego-charger-empty.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002569" /><br/>
The chargers are covered in a vegan leather material that seems to resist dust and is soft to the touch, so it won't scratch your devices. The Qi2 and Apple Watch chargers are flat, but the Apple Watch has a pop-up puck so it can charge flat or raised up for Nightstand mode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-onthego-charger-in-use.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002570" /><br/>
With the 3-in-1 model, the AirPods charger and the Qi2 charger can be folded upright with the Apple Watch charger as a base, forming a stand that can hold an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; upright while also providing space for charging the Apple Watch. This orientation is useful for StandBy Mode, but you'll need to fold it flat if you want to charge three devices at once. In any orientation, it works well on a hotel nightstand or an office desk.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-onthego-charger-size.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002571" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charger is Qi2, so it charges an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at up to 15W, the same as the original &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging speed. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models support faster 25W charging, so Qi2 is a slower wireless charging speed. There are no third-party &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; 2 chargers on the market yet, so 25W charging is only available with a standalone &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-onthego-charger-2-in-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002572" /><br/>
The middle charger for the AirPods is standard Qi and it is 5W, while the Apple Watch charger offers fast charging for compatible Apple Watch models. In testing, the Qi2 charger was able to charge my <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max to 41 percent in an hour, starting from around two percent, which is in line with what I expect from 15W wireless chargers. Wireless charging speeds are variable due to heat restrictions, so charging speeds can fluctuate if an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; gets warm or the room that it's charging in is warm. My &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; did get warm when using the Satechi charger, but not hot. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-onthego-charger-in-bag.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002573" /><br/>
Satechi is selling the chargers in three colors, including black, sand, and desert rose. Each comes with a matching USB-C cable that's a meter long, but there is no USB-C power adapter included, so you will need to supply your own. Satechi says that the charger needs a 36W power adapter at a minimum to charge devices at the maximum speeds. Along with the USB-C cable and the charger, Satechi includes a little travel pouch so you can tuck the folded charger in a bag, backpack, or suitcase.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
At &#36;100, the 3-in-1 OntheGo Charger from Satechi is reasonably priced for its compact size and its versatility. It can be used folded in multiple ways, and it provides reasonable overnight charging speeds for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, plus fast charging for an Apple Watch. The price is competitive with similar travel chargers from notable brands, as it's cheaper than Belkin's &#36;120 3-in-1 Travel Charger, and Mophie's &#36;150 3-in-1 Travel Charger. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/satechi-onthego-charger-in-use-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002574" /><br/>
I do wish that Satechi had included a USB-C power adapter. The 36W charger that it requires is a little bit bigger than what you'd get with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, so it might not be a size that people just have on hand. <br/>
<br/>
Given how small it folds up, this is a great option for those who are looking for a travel charger or even something to bring between work and home. The 2-in-1 model works the same, but it seems worth spending an extra &#36;20 for the AirPods charger and the stand functionality unless you want something even more compact.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2><br/>
The OntheGo 3-in-1 Charger can be <a href="https://satechi.net/products/onthego-3-in-1-charger">purchased from the Satechi website</a> for &#36;100. The <a href="https://satechi.net/products/onthego-2-in-1-charger">2-in-1 model</a> is also available for &#36;80.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The next generation of CarPlay is finally starting to roll out, and it includes a new feature that solves one of regular CarPlay's longstanding limitations.<br/>

Apple last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">announced the launch of CarPlay Ultra</a>, and it offers a Radio app, allowing you to control AM and FM radio stations within CarPlay. With regular CarPlay, you must switch between CarPlay and your vehicle's built-in software interface to control the radio, so CarPlay Ultra will be more convenient for this purpose.<br/>
<br/>
CarPlay Ultra's built-in Radio app can also be used to control satellite radio stations, but this is less notable given that SiriusXM already offers a CarPlay app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shared an image of the SiriusXM experience within the Radio app, but unfortunately it did not provide a look at the AM/FM side of the app.<br/>

Apple did preview the FM radio controls when it first announced next-generation CarPlay in 2022, but the design of the app has slightly changed since then.<br/>

CarPlay Ultra also has a Climate app with climate controls, allowing you to adjust your vehicle's temperature and fan speeds within CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
CarPlay Ultra is rolling out in new and select existing Aston Martin vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, so it is currently limited to one luxury brand. Apple promised that many other automakers around the world will offer CarPlay Ultra over the next year, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/carplay-ultra-committed-automakers/">list of committed brands</a> including Hyundai, Kia, Genesis, and others.<br/>
