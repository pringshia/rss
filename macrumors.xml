		<description><![CDATA[Samsung today <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-enhances-hotel-stays-with-apple-airplay-on-hospitality-tvs">announced</a> that it will be rolling out AirPlay support for its series of hotel room TVs, allowing iPhone and iPad users to wirelessly stream videos, music, photos, and more from their device to the TV in their room.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airplay-hotels.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898340" /><br/>
The feature allows you to scan a unique QR code on the hotel room TV to establish an AirPlay connection, allowing you to wirelessly stream content from your iPhone or iPad. After the pairing process, your device will also automatically be connected to the hotel's Wi-Fi network. The device must be updated to iOS 17.3 or iPadOS 17.3 or later.<br/>
<br/>
AirPlay on hotel room TVs works with apps and services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade for games, Apple Fitness+ for workouts, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung said no personal info is ever stored or saved for this AirPlay feature, and the paired device is automatically removed when you check out of the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung did not reveal which hotel chains will be offering its AirPlay-enabled TVs. The feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/ios-17-airplay-hotel-feature-now-available/">launched earlier this year</a> on LG hotel room TVs at select IHG Hotels & Resorts properties in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, with more locations to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Google has long offered a similar Chromecast streaming feature on many hotel room TVs that works with both iPhones and Android devices.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/27/samsung-airplay-hotel-room-tvs/">Samsung to Begin Rolling Out Hotel Room TVs With AirPlay Support for iPhone and iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-to-begin-rolling-out-hotel-room-tvs-with-airplay-support-for-iphone-and-ipad.2430238/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models that Apple released earlier this year have a display upgrade option that allows you to purchase nano-texture display glass, which is supposed to cut down on glare.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gwSnEl4sVa0" title="11&quot; M4 iPad Pro Long Term Review: Nano-Texture Glass Worth it?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
We've already reviewed the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, but we thought we'd revisit the nano-texture glass upgrade to see if it's worth the purchase price.<br/>
<br/>
First introduced with the Pro Display XDR, nano-texture glass is etched at a nanometer scale, which is meant to preserve image quality while scattering ambient light to cut down on glare. It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with nano-texture as an option, and it's previously been reserved for the Studio Display and Pro Display XDR. Nano-texture is a premium feature, so it costs an additional &#36;100 over the standard glass. It's also only available on 1TB or 2TB &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, so you do need to shell out at least &#36;1,600 to get it on the 1TB 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Nano-texture on the larger &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will cost at least &#36;1,999, which is the price of the 1TB model plus an extra &#36;100 for the glass upgrade. It is an upgrade targeted at pro users and those with specific needs, and not everyone is going to want to opt for the matte design. The grippier texture of the nano-glass does feel better for writing on with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, but if that's a factor for you, you're better off checking out something like <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/products/rock-paper-pencil">Astropad's Rock Paper Pencil</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While nano-texture does a good job cutting down on glare, it does impact the contrast and crispness of the display, so it is serving a specific purpose for select workflows where mitigating light is important.<br/>
<br/>
As with the nano-texture versions of Apple's displays, the nano-texture &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; requires some special care. Apple recommends only cleaning it with the polishing cloth that's included in the box as other cleaning cloths can cause damage.<br/>
<br/>
Given the caveats and the high price tag, the nano-texture display isn't for everyone, but it is a good option for those who know they need extra help addressing glare.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/27/ipad-nano-texture-glass-hands-on/">Hands-On With the iPad Pro&#039;s Nano-Texture Glass - Is It Worth the Upgrade?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-the-ipad-pros-nano-texture-glass-is-it-worth-the-upgrade.2430232/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy has opened up a new "<a href="https://howl.me/cmydmDOWOd2">Member Deals Days</a>" sale, featuring thousands of discounts available exclusively to My Best Buy Plus and Total members. New deals will appear every day of the event, which ends this Sunday, June 30.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macbook-air-and-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957103" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
In order to gain access to these deals, you'll need to be a My Best Buy Plus or Total member. These services are <a href="https://howl.me/cmydl3lgN7m">available starting at &#36;49.99 per year</a>, and offer free two-day shipping, an extended 60-day return window on most products, exclusive access to certain sales like Member Deals Days, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/cmydmDOWOd2"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">EXCLUSIVE SALE</div>Best Buy Member Deals Days</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
In terms of Apple products, the best deals available during this event are on the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. You can get the 256GB model for <a href="https://howl.me/cmydqPtY0P8"><strong>&#36;849.00</strong></a> and the 512GB model for <a href="https://howl.me/cmydqmASWxo"><strong>&#36;1,049.00</strong></a>, both of which are &#36;150 off original prices and solid second-best discounts.<br/>
<br/>
There are also a few noteworthy 16-inch MacBook Pro discounts at Best Buy this week. The retailer has the 12-Core M3 Pro/18GB RAM/512GB model for <a href="https://howl.me/cmydwcE4wk7"><strong>&#36;2,149.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;2,499.00, and the 12-Core M3 Pro/36GB RAM/512GB model for <a href="https://howl.me/cmydwxr4Noa"><strong>&#36;2,499.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;2,899.00. These are both all-time low prices on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, and although Best Buy has more MacBook Pro discounts during its new sale, these are the best you'll find.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the <a href="https://howl.me/cmydmDOWOd2">Member Deals Days sale</a> has many discounts other than Apple products, including TVs, video games, PCs, headphones, home appliances, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[There appears to be an ongoing outage with international roaming across multiple cellular networks, with Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile customers abroad complaining about the issue on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/">social networks</a> and <a href="https://community.verizon.com">cellular community forums</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/verizon.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957071" /><br/>
Customers traveling internationally have been without service since late Wednesday for hours at a time, with many losing cellular, text, and data. That has left many users unable to call their cellular provider hotline or access online chat help without a Wi-Fi network. <br/>
<br/>
Based on feedback from customers that have managed to contact support, the providers are aware of the issue with international roaming and are actively working on resolving it, although there have been reports that this could take several hours. We'll update this article as soon as we learn more.<br/>
<br/>

We have updated the story headline to reflect the development.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Update 3:</strong> The multi-network outage is related to issues at international connection partner <a href="https://www.syniverse.com">Syniverse</a>, according to a person familiar with the situation.

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> is malfunctioning in Hungary, according <a href="https://index.hu/gazdasag/2024/06/26/fizetes-elofizetes-otp-bank-hiba-apple-pay-penz/">to reports</a> from several <a href="https://telex.hu/gazdasag/2024/06/26/apple-pay-levonas-fizetes-otp-bank">Hungarian news sites</a>. Apple device owners are seeing surprise, unexpected charges without making purchases.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Pay-Canada.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943673" /><br/>
Some users are seeing multiple mistaken transactions, and it is a problem that appears to be affecting most banks in Hungary. Impacted users are being charged small amounts several times in a row. One user saw almost &#36;1,500 USD pulled from his account across 74 rapid fire transactions.<br/>
<br/>
Hungarian news sites say that banks are being slammed with requests for help, and that it appears to be a problem on Apple's end. OTP Bank in Hungary said that "massive, unjustified debits" were made to cards at several banks, with the situation still being analyzed to determine what happened. A statement on <a href="https://www.raiffeisen.hu/fooldal/-/asset_publisher/3yvyD1ghPjYw/content/teves-bankkartya-terhelesek-az-apple-alkalmazasbolt-iranyabol/maximized?_com_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_3yvyD1ghPjYw_assetEntryId=3734451">Raiffeisen Bank's website</a> says that Apple is working to resolve the problem.<br/>
<blockquote>We inform our customers that due to a technical problem with an external partner, the bank cards of some of our customers may have been incorrectly charged by the Apple App Store. Our colleagues have contacted Apple officials, the problem is being resolved.</blockquote><br/>
Some of the charges appear to be linked to subscriptions that were canceled previously, and some of the amounts match prior transactions. Some customers have been able to have their banks block their cards, preventing further charges.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today published a <a href="https://support.apple.com/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/otherassets/programs/Longevity_by_Design.pdf">lengthy whitepaper</a> that highlights the company's approach to device repairability and longevity. In the document, Apple revealed that iPhones will better support third-party displays and batteries later in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912514" /><br/>
First, Apple said True Tone will work with third-party iPhone displays later this year:<blockquote>True Tone requires precise calibration to function properly, and it is not possible to engage a default calibration for third-party displays, which can result in unexpected behavior. For this reason, Apple disables the True Tone feature when third-party displays are used, but enables all other aspects of the display. <strong>In an effort to offer more complete support for third-party parts, starting later in 2024, Apple will allow consumers to activate True Tone with third-party parts to the best performance that can be provided.</strong><br/>
<br/>
They will be able to deactivate True Tone in Settings if the display does not perform to their satisfaction.</blockquote>True Tone automatically adapts the color of the display to match the light in your environment.<br/>
<br/>
Second, Apple said battery health metrics such as maximum capacity and cycle count will work with third-party iPhone batteries later this year:<blockquote>Currently, battery health metrics such as maximum capacity and cycle count are not presented to consumers whose devices have third-party batteries. This is because the accuracy of these metrics cannot be verified by Apple. In fact, an Apple internal analysis has found that some third-party batteries sold as new are actually secondhand, with battery health metrics manipulated to appear as new. <strong>In an effort to improve support for third-party batteries, starting later in 2024, Apple will display battery health metrics with a notification stating that Apple cannot verify the information presented.</strong></blockquote>Apple said the third-party battery metrics are not guaranteed to be accurate.<br/>
<br/>
These changes will presumably be rolled out with iOS 18 updates later this year, but Apple did not provide more specific timing in its document.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/iphone-third-party-display-battery-support/">Apple Says iPhones Will Better Support Third-Party Displays and Batteries Later This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphones-will-better-support-third-party-displays-and-batteries-later-this-year.2430156/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming iOS 18 software update is packed with features for supported iPhones, but it also promises to make your AirPods Pro experience better with a handful of sophisticated new capabilities that draw from machine learning improvements and AI enhancements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-and-AirPods-Pro-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956922" /><br/>
The following five AirPods Pro features are expected to arrive later this year, when iOS 18 is released to the general public in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Head Gestures</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/f-6805c507f8a4ad4d1cf5bf1383c0c89ad096b3e0.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954464" /><br/>
Apple is set to add new head gestures that allow users to control AirPods Pro handsfree and without saying a word. With the new gestures, you can nod your head up and down, or shake it left to right, in order to answer or decline a call. Siri Interactions will also allow users to answer or dismiss calls, interact with messages, manage notifications, and more — all without speaking.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Voice Isolation</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/voice-isolation-1.jpg" alt="voice" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-889480" /><br/>
Apple's iPhones include a calling feature that can make your voice clearer to the person you're speaking to when on a call, even when you're in a busy environment. Apple in iOS 18 is adding Voice Isolation to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ so that they also cut down on loud background sounds.<br/>
<br/>
When you're on a call, the mics on AirPods Pro usually pick up a wide range of sounds in the environment, like wind around the caller. But with Voice Isolation, machine learning will distinguish these sounds, block out any ambient noise, and prioritize your voice so that it comes through clearly.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Personalized Spatial Audio for Gaming</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Spatial-Audio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1698" height="978" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787199" /><br/>
Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking will be available for gaming across AirPods (3rd generation), AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max — delivering the immersive audio customers have come to love when listening to music, or watching movies and shows. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says that when using AirPods Pro, gamers will have the best wireless audio latency it has ever delivered for mobile gaming. AirPods Pro users will also enjoy improved voice quality, including 16-bit, 48kHz audio, when chatting with teammates and other players. Game developers will also be able to incorporate spatial audio into their games for a more immersive audio experience.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Granular Adaptive Audio Control</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/airpods-adaptive-audio.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955239" /><br/>
Apple's second-generation AirPods Pro have an Adaptive Audio feature called Adaptive Noise Control, which adjusts sound and active noise cancelation in response to changes in your environment. <br/>
<br/>
Right now, Adaptive Audio is an all or nothing setting, but that's set to change in iOS 18. Apple has added a "Customize Adaptive Audio" menu that lets you adjust the setting to allow for more or less noise.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Hearing Aid Mode</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-noise-cancellation.jpg" alt="AirPods Pro" width="1212" height="659" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716249" /><br/>
AirPods Pro will gain a new "hearing aid mode" with the release of iOS 18 later this year, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/airpods-pro-to-gain-hearing-aid-mode-ios-18/">March report</a> by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. AirPods Pro already offer a Conversation Boost feature, which boosts the volume and clarity of people directly in front of the wearer, but so far Apple has not advertised the earbuds as a hearing aid device.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/ios-18-new-features-airpods-pro/">iOS 18 to Bring These 5 New Features to AirPods Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-to-bring-these-5-new-features-to-airpods-pro.2430153/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Discounts on Apple's AirTag have expanded to include the 1 Pack this week, and also still cover a sale on the 4 Pack of the Bluetooth trackers at Amazon. We're also seeing a record low discount on an AirTag alternative from Eufy, as well as savings on Apple Pencil 2 and Apple Pencil Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/airtag-orange-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957000" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the AirTag 1 Pack, Amazon has this accessory on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CWXNS552%2Fref%3Dfs_a_md_0"><strong>&#36;24.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;29.00. This AirTag 1 Pack isn't on sale as often as the 4 Pack option, so even at just &#36;4 off it's still a solid discount at its second-best price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CWXNS552%2Fref%3Dfs_a_md_0"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;4 OFF</div>AirTag 1 Pack for &#36;24.99</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Amazon also has the AirTag 4 Pack available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0932QJ2JZ"><strong>&#36;78.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00. This is another second-best price, and just about &#36;4 higher than the all-time low price. As of writing, the AirTag 4 Pack can be delivered as soon as June 28 for Prime members.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Eufy</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/eufy-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956999" /><br/>

Although this is only a &#36;10 discount, it's the lowest price we've tracked on the brand new Apple Pencil Pro among the major online retailers. The Apple Pencil 2 is also at an all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.00</strong></a> right now on Amazon.<br/>

The Apple Pencil Pro is compatible with the M4 iPad Pro and the M2 iPad Air, and marks the first update to the Apple Pencil since the Apple Pencil 2 in 2018.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-expands-self-service-repair-diagnostics-support-to-europe/">announced</a> that it now offers a diagnostics tool for self-service iPhone, Mac, and Studio Display repairs in Europe. This software lets customers complete the System Configuration process following <a href="https://support.apple.com/self-service-repair">self-service repairs</a> by placing the device into Diagnostics Mode and following the on-screen prompts, without needing to contact Apple.<br/>
<br/>

Apple says the diagnostics tool is now available in 32 countries in Europe, including the U.K., France, Germany, the Netherlands, and others. The tool, which was previously limited to technicians at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, first became available for self-service repairs in the U.S. last year.<br/>
<br/>
Launched in 2022, the self-service program provides customers with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and manuals to repair select iPhone, Mac, and Studio Display models, allowing for some do-it-yourself repairs.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google is reportedly scrapping continuous scrolling of search results on desktop and mobile, with the company returning to the old method of dividing results into several pages (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185727/google-search-continuous-scrolling-doomscrolling-graveyard">The Verge</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837104" /><br/>
Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/06/google-search-continous-scrolling-us-desktop/">introduced continuous scrolling</a> on mobile and desktop in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change was reminiscent of a social media feed, although Google's version was never quite the "infinite scroll" that social network users will be familiar with. Search has typically returned the equivalent of six pages of results in a single scroll, before offering users a "More results" button that keeps the scroll going.<br/>
<br/>
Google originally claimed that continuous scroll would make browsing results quicker and easier, although some users likely missed how the old pagination system often acted as a natural breaker that allowed them to consider whether they had all the information they needed.<br/>
<br/>
A Google spokesperson reportedly told <em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-dropping-continuous-scroll-in-search-results-443529">Search Engine Land</a></em> that continuous scroll would be removed from desktop search results from June 25, while the feature will be removed from mobile results "in the coming months." Google said that the change is needed to allow it to serve search results faster, instead of automatically loading results that users haven't explicitly requested.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/google-scraps-continuous-scrolling-search-results/">Google Scraps Continuous Scrolling in Search Results</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-scraps-continuous-scrolling-in-search-results.2430151/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple's Podcasts app now shows chapter segments of a podcast when you scrub through a currently playing episode, making it easier to browse through the audio content.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/podcasts-scrubbing-chapters-ios-18.jpeg" alt="" width="1170" height="714" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956975" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1do9pg8/ios_18_db2_podcasts_now_shows_chapters_segments/">Reddit user Wristnut</a></em></div><br/>
As spotted by Redditor "Wristnut," navigating the timeline across the chapter segments shows the chapter name above the line. Note that this behavior appears in the Podcasts app proper, and it is not currently reproducible on the Lock Screen media controls in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 2.<br/>
<br/>
While the ability to scrub through chapter segments is new, chapters themselves are not. Some podcast listeners may not be familiar with them because creators have to manually add chapters, and many shows have not adopted them. Creators must specify chapters in the header of an MP4 file or by modifying the ID3 tags of MP3 or AAC files using third-party tools.<br/>
<br/>
When creators do support chapters, listeners can find them by swiping up on the Now Playing screen on iOS and iPadOS or by clicking the Chapters button located in the top-right corner of the Podcasts app for macOS. Creators can also provide chapter-specific artwork that is displayed on the Now Playing screen and on the Lock Screen on iOS and iPadOS, providing a timely visual supplement to the podcast.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> supports chapters for MP4, MP3, and AAC files, whether they are available from the directory or manually added to the Library via an RSS feed. Some of the tools used to add chapters include Ferrite on iOS and iPadOS, Forecast by Overcast, Podcasts Chapters on macOS, and Vizzy on the web.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is currently in its second developer beta, with a public beta expected in July, followed by a general release in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/ios-18-podcasts-scrubbing-chapters/">iOS 18: Podcasts App Now Shows Chapter Segments When Scrubbing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-podcasts-app-now-shows-chapter-segments-when-scrubbing.2430148/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, Apple has added a new "Keep Downloaded" option when browsing items in iCloud, allowing users to designate which files and folders should remain permanently available locally on their device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-15-keep-downloaded.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956964" /><br/>
In previous versions of iOS and macOS, users had limited control over which files and folders were kept offline. iCloud's automatic management system would offload files from the device to free up space, potentially removing files that you might want to keep available at all times. <br/>
<br/>
Apple offered no straightforward way to prevent this – until now. In macOS Sequoia, when browsing iCloud Drive in Finder, right-clicking a file or folder reveals the new "Keep Downloaded" option. When enabled, the cloud symbol next to the item is opaque instead of transparent, indicating that it will remain on the device. <br/>
<br/>
In iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, the same option can be found in the Files app when a file or folder is long pressed to bring up the contextual menu. Users can now explicitly mark files to remain on their device, regardless of how much storage they take up.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to prevent iCloud items from being offloaded should be particularly welcomed by users who need to frequently access documents or files during travel or in areas with poor connectivity. macOS Sequoia, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18 are available in a beta capacity right now, and are limited to developers. The new option should be available to all users when the software launches to the public this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/icloud-keep-downloaded-option-ios-18-macos-sequoia/">iCloud &#039;Keep Downloaded&#039; Option Included in iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/icloud-keep-downloaded-option-included-in-ios-18-and-macos-sequoia.2430145/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">planning a revamp</a> of the Apple Watch for the device's tenth anniversary, and <em><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-apple-watch-series-10-cad-renders/">91mobiles</a></em> claims to have sourced CAD renders of what could be the "Apple Watch X" or Apple Watch Series 10 from industry insiders.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-watch-x-91mobiles.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956954" /><br/>
The site claims that the renders are of a "larger" model featuring a 2-inch display. The current Apple Watch Series 9 has a 1.7-inch display, while the Apple Watch Ultra has a display size of 1.93-inches, so this would be the biggest screen on an Apple Watch so far.<br/>
<br/>
That said, its dimensions are said to measure roughly 46 x 39.7 x 11.6mm, which would make it bigger overall than the Series 9 but smaller than the Ultra. Otherwise, the renders suggest a design similar to the Series 9, with a Digital Crown and Side button, and a square display.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said a significantly overhauled "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">Apple Watch X</a>" would launch in either 2024 or 2025, to mark the tenth anniversary of the device, so this could be the anniversary device, or it could be the Apple Watch Series 10. The original Apple Watch was announced in September 2014 and released in April 2015. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman said the "Apple Watch X" would be equipped with a thinner case. The <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter also said it would potentially have a magnetic band attachment system, although there's no evidence of that in the renders. <br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">claimed</a> that Apple Watch Series 10 will be thinner and come in larger screen sizes than previous models. Kuo said the screen size options on the next-generation Apple Watch will increase from 41mm to 45mm, and from 45mm to 49mm, while being encased in a thinner design. For reference, the Apple Watch Ultra has a 49mm case.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear at this point whether the CAD renders are accurate, but either way Apple typically launches new Apple Watch models around September alongside its latest iPhone lineup. Apple is said to be planning to incorporate blood pressure monitoring this year, with the watch able to detect hypertension, while sleep apnea detection is also said to be coming to the 2024 Apple Watch model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/91mobiles-com/">91Mobiles</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">Apple Watch X</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10/">Alleged First Look at Apple Watch X / Series 10 With 2-Inch Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10-with-2-inch-display.2430143/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340">release notes</a> for AirPods firmware typically offer few details on included changes, the company has published a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214111">separate support document</a> outlining a security issue that was fixed in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/apple-all-airpods-new-firmware/">today's firmware updates</a> for AirPods, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a>, and Beats Fit Pro.<br/>
<br/>

According to the document, today's firmware updates address a security issue that could have allowed an attacker within Bluetooth range to spoof the details of a device you've previously connected your headphones to, allowing the attacker to gain access to your headphones.<br/>
<br/>
Apple usually mentions in its support documents if a security issue is known to have been exploited in the wild, but the company has not indicated that this is the case with this issue. Still, it's a good idea to update the firmware on your headphones as soon as possible as others could be inspired to attempt to replicate an exploit of the issue now that its existence has been publicized.<br/>
<br/>
There is no straightforward mechanism for initiating a firmware update for AirPods and Beats headphones, with Apple simply stating that the updates are "automatically delivered while your headphones are paired with and in Bluetooth range of your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac."<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/airpods-beats-firmware-security-issue/">AirPods and Beats Firmware Updates Address Important Security Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-and-beats-firmware-updates-address-important-security-issue.2430125/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> that came out yesterday, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/everything-new-in-ios-18-beta-2/">added an RCS toggle</a>, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a> messaging was not working at that time. &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; support appears to now be rolling out, based on reports from &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-beta-2-rcs-toggle.jpg" alt="" width="2174" height="1223" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956804" /><br/>
Some testers who have &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; installed have confirmed that they are able to send &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; messages to Android users, with &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; features available. Texts that are RCS-based instead of SMS/MMS-based are denoted with an &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; label.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Y'all...! <a href="https://t.co/6NDjmH3WdH">pic.twitter.com/6NDjmH3WdH</a></p>— Snazzy Labs (@SnazzyLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyLabs/status/1805711143484506438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
&zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, or Rich Communication Services, allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Android users to exchange higher quality photos and videos, audio messages, and larger file sizes. Features like read receipts and real-time typing indicators are supported too, with a full list of what's new available below.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Support for higher resolution photos and videos.</li><br/>
 	<li>Support for larger file sizes and file sharing.</li><br/>
 	<li>Audio messages.</li><br/>
 	<li>Cross-platform emoji reactions.</li><br/>
 	<li>Real-time typing indicators.</li><br/>
 	<li>Read receipts.</li><br/>
 	<li>Ability to send messages over cellular or Wi-Fi (SMS is cellular only). There is no cost to send an &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; message over Wi-Fi.</li><br/>
 	<li>Improved group chats.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
&zwnj;RCS&zwnj; messages can be enabled in the Messages section of the Settings app, and are toggled on by default. At the current time, &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; messaging is only available to those in the United States who have a carrier that supports &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;. T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon users running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; should have the &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; toggle available, but those with MVNOs and smaller carriers will not be able to use the feature yet.<br/>
<br/>
Not all &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; users with T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon are seeing &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; enabled, so it appears that support is still rolling out.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is available in a beta capacity right now, and it is limited to developers. &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; will be available to all &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; users when the software launches to the public this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/ios-18-rcs-support/">iOS 18 RCS Support Rolling Out to Beta Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rcs-support-rolling-out-to-beta-users.2430112/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The ChatGPT app for Mac is now available to all users, OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1805679342439284831">announced today</a>. The app first came out in mid-May, but it saw a slow rollout that was limited to ChatGPT Plus subscribers until now.<br/>
<br/>

OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Mac app is meant to make it easier for users to access ChatGPT and to ask questions about email, screenshots, websites, and content on the Mac. With the ChatGPT app installed, you can press Option + Space on the keyboard to bring up a chat interface for asking ChatGPT a question.<br/>
<br/>
There's a built-in Voice Mode for having voice conversations with ChatGPT, a search feature for looking through past conversations, and more. With the wider rollout, no subscription plan is necessary for using ChatGPT on the Mac. OpenAI has made the latest version of ChatGPT, GPT-4o, available for free, but for a limited number of requests.<br/>

The second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; models, the PowerBeats Pro, and the Beats Fit Pro now have firmware version 6F8, up from 6F7, while the other models have firmware version 6A326, up from 6A321.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not often provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware beyond "bug fixes and other improvements," so it is unclear what's new in the update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple doesn't offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ or Beats in the case, connecting to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods or Beats‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌AirPods to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon this week has a collection of discounts on the Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Ultra 2, providing near all-time low prices on both of these wearables.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch SE</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-se-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952115" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Apple's 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8RVB8%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a> today on Amazon, down from &#36;249.00. This is just &#36;10 higher compared to the all-time low price on the wearable. This deal is available in all three aluminum color options, and only Amazon has the discount.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8RVB8%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;60 OFF</div>Apple Watch SE (40mm GPS) for &#36;189.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5W8YM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;60 OFF</div>Apple Watch SE (44mm GPS) for &#36;219.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
You can also get the 44mm GPS Apple Watch SE on sale right now, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5W8YM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;219.00</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;279.00. This is another near all-time low price that's just &#36;10 away from the lowest price on the Apple Watch SE, and it's also available in all three aluminum colors.<br/>
<br/>
This model of the Apple Watch SE launched in September 2022 and remains Apple's most affordable Apple Watch. The Apple Watch SE lacks some of the upgraded features you'll find in some Series 9 or Ultra 2 models, like temperature sensing and ECG functionality, but it will otherwise provide you with all key Apple Watch features, and at the cheapest price possible.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Ultra 2</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ultra-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952114" /><br/>
<br/>
Finally, we're also tracking a solid deal on one model of the Apple Watch Ultra 2. You can get the model with the Indigo Alpine Loop (Small) for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8Z6W4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;714.00</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;799.00. While this is the only model at &#36;714.00, Amazon also has a bigger collection of Ultra 2 models at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWZ5VVM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;719.00</strong></a>, a solid second-best price.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/de/newsroom/2024/06/apple-launches-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-in-germany/">today announced</a> that Tap to Pay on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is available in Germany, providing a way for independent sellers, small businesses, and larger merchants in the country to use an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as a contactless payment terminal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tap-to-pay-iphone-germany.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956919" /><br/>
Retailers can take advantage of the NFC chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to accept credit and debit card payments, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, and other tap-based payment methods. Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; works similarly to hardware-based payment systems like the Square Reader, but it does not require additional hardware to work.<br/>
<br/>
When a customer makes a purchase, a merchant that supports Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can accept a payment by having the customer bring a credit card, debit card, prepaid card, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Apple Watch, or other digital wallet close to the merchant's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The transaction is completed through NFC, with processing done using the Secure Element for security purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is available to payment platforms and payment app developers in Germany. Adyen, Commerz Globalpay, myPOS, Nexi, SumUp, and Viva support Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; starting today, with mollie, PAYONE, Revolut, Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, and Stripe set to implement support later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
Since Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; first launched in the United States in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/08/apple-announces-tap-to-pay-iphone-feature/">February 2022</a>, Apple has been working to expand it to additional countries. It is now available in 12 countries, including United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Brazil, Italy, France, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Germany.<br/>
<br/>
Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is compatible with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS and newer, so iPhones manufactured since September 2018 can use it. Tap to Pay also requires a contactless card or device, and it is compatible with cards from American Express, Global Discover Network, Diners, Mastercard, and Visa.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/germany/">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-now-available-in-germany/">Tap to Pay on iPhone Now Available in Germany</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-now-available-in-germany.2430091/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
