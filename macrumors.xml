		<description><![CDATA[A security researcher who reported bugs to Apple was arrested in January for defrauding the company out of millions of dollars, according to a report from <a href="https://www.404media.co/security-researcher-allegedly-hacked-apples-backend-scammed-2-5-million/"><em>404 Media</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/bug-security-vulnerability-issue-fix-larry.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896108" /><br/>
The researcher, Noah Roskin-Frazee, was accused alongside a co-conspirator obtaining over &#36;3 million in products and services through more than two dozen fraudulent orders. That included around &#36;2.5 million in gift cards and over &#36;100,000 in "products and services."<br/>
<br/>
While Apple is not explicitly named in the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24412154-noah-roskin-frazee?ref=404media.co">court records</a>, an unnamed "Company A" is located in Cupertino, California, and is clearly Apple. The court mentions that one of the perpetrators used gift cards to "purchase Final Cut Pro on Company A's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>," and Apple is the only company that sells the software.<br/>
<br/>
In 2019, Frazee and his accomplice used a password reset tool to gain access to an employee account that belonged to an unnamed "Company B," which does customer support for Apple. That account led to access to additional employee credentials, and Frazee accessed Company B's VPN servers. From there, Frazee was able to get into Apple's systems, placing fraudulent orders for Apple products.<br/>
<br/>
He used Apple's "Toolbox" program that could be used to edit orders after they were placed, and he changed order values to zero, added products to orders, and extended <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> contracts. He abused Apple's program from January to March 2019.<br/>
<blockquote>The defendants remoted into computers located in India and Costa Rica as part of the scheme, the indictment adds. The scam itself involved changing order monetary values to zero, adding products to existing orders without cost such as phones and laptops, and extending existing service contracts, the indictment adds. That included extending a customer service contract that was associated with one of the defendants and his family for an extra two years without paying.</blockquote><br/>
Apple thanked Frazee for in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214036">January support document</a> for finding several bugs in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, and the document was published less than two weeks after he was arrested. "We would like to acknowledge Noah Roskin-Frazee and Prof. J. (ZeroClicks.ai Lab) for their assistance," reads Apple's page in reference to a Wi-Fi vulnerability.<br/>
<br/>
Frazee has been charged with wire fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, and intentional damage to a protected computer. He will be required to forfeit all of the stolen goods, and he could be sentenced to more than 20 years in jail if convicted.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/security-researcher-apple-theft/">Security Researcher Allegedly Exploited Internal Apple Tool to Steal Millions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/security-researcher-allegedly-exploited-internal-apple-tool-to-steal-millions.2418847/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began offering <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">refurbished versions</a> of the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip, offering the machines at a discount for the first time since their October 2023 launch date.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/macbook-pro-bb-cyber.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924141" /><br/>
Pricing on the refurbished 14-inch MacBook Pro models starts at &#36;1,359, a &#36;240 discount off of the original &#36;1,599 starting price.<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, Apple appears to be offering only MacBook Pro models with the standard M3 chip, with no M3 Pro or M3 Max machines available for purchase. Apple has several configurations listed with additional storage space.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the entry-level models have already sold out, and availability will fluctuate as Apple restocks the refurbished store. Customers looking for a specific configuration should check back often.<br/>
<br/>
All of Apple's refurbished Macs are close to identical to new products. They are subject to a refurbishment process that includes full functionality testing, with any defective modules replaced, as well as a thorough cleaning and inspection. Refurbished products are eligible for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ and have the same 14-day return period as new Apple devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro/">Apple Now Selling Refurbished 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro.2418844/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new iOS 17.4 update that brings some major changes to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> (and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>) in Europe. Some of the biggest updates are only going to update people in the European Union, but there are also plenty of features in iOS 17.4 that are available worldwide. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In this article, we've rounded up everything new so far in iOS 17.4. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="eu_changes">EU Changes</h2><br/>
Apple implemented notable changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act. These changes are included in iOS 17.4, but are limited to countries that are in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833990" /><br/>
<h3 id="alternative_app_stores_and_new_app_store_terms">Alternative App Stores and New App Store Terms</h3><br/>
App developers in the EU can opt to offer alternative app stores or install their apps through alternative stores, and Apple has a whole new fee structure that goes along with this change. There's a new business structure that developers can opt in to, which applies to both apps distributed in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and apps that are distributed through alternative means.<br/>
<br/>
App developers using the new system will need to pay a standard fee of 0.50 euros per user per year, with the first million installs offered for free. Apps distributed through alternative app stores will have no commission. Apps distributed through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will pay a reduced 17 percent commission, or 10 percent for those in the small business program or for user subscriptions older than a year.<br/>
<br/>
Developers can choose not to opt in to the new system and can use the existing system with the same 15/30 percent commission that's available elsewhere in the world. Apple has a fee calculator to help developers determine what they'll pay with the existing setup, with the new setup, with the new setup using alternative app stores, and with the new setup using the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Users are able to set their preferred alternative app store as the default app store on their device if desired. EU users will see an option for this in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
There are a huge number of behind-the-scene changes that are enabling this feature in the EU, with updates to all kinds of system messaging. Users in the EU will, for example, get a pop up warning when an app from an alternative app store contains malware, and there are new screens for verifying the information from an alternative app.<br/>
<br/>
A Screen Time setting will allow parents to decide whether their children's devices are able to install apps from alternative app marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="alternative_payment_options">Alternative Payment Options</h2><br/>
Apple is also allowing apps to use alternative payment options in their apps, and there is no longer a requirement to use in-app purchase. Developers who distribute apps through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and use an alternative payment option will see a three percent discount in their &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fees.<br/>
<br/>
Developers who distribute through alternative apps and also use an alternative payment option will pay Apple no fees beyond the set 0.50 euro fee per user.<br/>
<br/>
With alternative payments, purchases for digital goods and services can be made directly in an app or a developer can choose to link to their website to have a user make a payment. Apple is requiring developers to use a known, secure payment provider.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="third-party_browser_updates">Third-Party Browser Updates</h3><br/>
After updating to iOS 17.4, EU users that open Safari will see a pop up that allows them to choose a new default browser option from a list of the most popular browsers on iOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also allowing alternative browser engines, and will not limit browsers like Chrome to the WebKit engine.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="nfc_access">NFC Access</h3><br/>
Third-party payment apps and banks have access to the NFC chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in iOS 17.4, and can offer contactless payments directly on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or the Wallet app in the European Economic Area. Users can set a default contactless payment provider that activates at tap-to-pay terminals or when the Side button on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is pressed twice.<br/>
<br/>
The option for setting a default contactless payment provider is available in the Settings app in the EU, and this section will also provide details on all apps that have requested and been granted contactless payment access.<br/>
<br/>
EU users can also change the default Wallet app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="gaming_app_changes">Gaming App Changes</h2><br/>
Streaming game apps are now allowed on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; worldwide, which means services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW can be offered as standalone &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously only allowed cloud gaming services to be offered via the web, but dedicated apps that let users stream games from servers are now permitted.<br/>
<br/>
Mini-app, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins are also now able to use the in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_emoji">New Emoji</h2><br/>
The iOS 17.4 beta adds new emoji characters that include lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-New-Emoji-Feature-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1077" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932812" /><br/>
These emoji are part of the Unicode 15.1 update that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ios-17-future-emoji/">approved in September 2023</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messaging_with_siri">Messaging with Siri</h2><br/>
The Automatically Send Messages setting under <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> & Search has been renamed "Messaging with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;," and there is an option to set &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to read incoming messages in a specific language like Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and many more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-messaging-with-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932819" /><br/>
The change does not update the primary language that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; listens in and responds to, but is limited to message playback.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="podcasts_and_music">Podcasts and Music</h2><br/>
The "Listen Now" tabs in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and Podcasts have been renamed to "Home."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-music-home.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932818" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="podcast_transcripts">Podcast Transcripts</h2><br/>
The Podcasts app now offers transcripts, similar to how lyrics work in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/podcast-app-transcript.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932875" /><br/>
Podcasts also uses the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Now Playing bar when collapsed. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2><br/>
The URL/search bar in Safari is now wider than it was before.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-wider-safari-url-bar.jpg" alt="" width="2807" height="1579" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932817" /><br/>
<h2 id="stolen_device_protection">Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
In the Stolen Device Protection section of the Settings app, there is now an option to require a security delay always or only when away from familiar locations. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932874" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="next-generation_carplay_support">Next-Generation CarPlay Support</h2><br/>
Next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> is set to launch in the U.S. later in 2024, and code in iOS 17.4 references eight new &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; apps. <br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Car Camera:</strong> This app will display the vehicle's rear-view camera feed.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> For electric vehicles, this app will display battery level, charging status, time remaining until the battery is fully charged, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Climate:</strong> This app will provide access to a vehicle's climate controls within &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heating system, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Closures:</strong> This app will display if any of the vehicle's doors are opened, and it might also display vehicle warning symbols.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> This app will provide access to FM and AM radio station controls within &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, along with other media options like SiriusXM. It is unclear if SiriusXM will offer satellite connectivity, or remain limited to internet streaming. Users will be able to select from a list of music genres, such as Top 40 and Rock.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Tire Pressure:</strong> This app will display air pressure for each of the vehicle's tires, and provide low pressure, high pressure, and flat tire warnings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Trips:</strong> This app will provide a variety of driving-related data, including the vehicle's average speed, fuel efficiency or energy efficiency, the total time elapsed and distance traveled on a trip, and more.</li></ul>An image in iOS 17.4 beta suggests that &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will also likely display a "Goodbye" screen after the driver shuts off the vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Goodbye.jpg" alt="" width="1374" height="484" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932992" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="shareplay">SharePlay</h2><br/>
SharePlay music control <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/">is expanding</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> with iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4. With the feature, a user's family and friends can control the music that is playing on a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, so long as the user has granted permission.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933114" /><br/>
The person who owns the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; needs to have an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription, but the person who is granted SharePlay access can play music using &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; without a subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Connecting to a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; to use SharePlay can be done by scanning a QR code on the device owner's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (for &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;) or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. Users can connect to a device while in the same space or remotely.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="stopwatch_live_activity">Stopwatch Live Activity</h2><br/>
iOS 17.4 adds a Live Activity function for the Stopwatch feature on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. When activated through the Clock app, the Stopwatch now shows up in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and on the Lock Screen. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stopwatch.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933379" /><br/>
There are controls for pausing the Stopwatch, clearing it, and starting a new lap. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_tv_app">Apple TV App</h2><br/>
The "How to Watch" section in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app that shows where a movie or TV show can be viewed now has a list interface rather than a card interface. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-how-to-watch.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933405" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="app_store">App Store</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;'s Purchase feature now shows account-wide purchase history for an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>. It includes TV and movie purchases, music purchases, subscriptions, and app purchases, and it is the same interface that is available when accessing the purchase information for any &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/app-store-purchase-history-ios-17-4.jpg" alt="" width="5289" height="2975" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933406" /><br/>
Apps are still listed, but under a new "Apps" section.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="clock_widget">Clock Widget</h2><br/>
There's a new City Digital Clock widget that can be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ios-17-4-city-digital.jpg" alt="" width="5344" height="3006" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935544" /><br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
Apple will release iOS 17.4 in March, likely during the first week of the month. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/magenta-status">today announced</a> that all of its customers have "Magenta Status," allowing them to access "one-of-a-kind" benefits from premium brands and services. T-Mobile says that customers can get discounts from "the biggest brands" like Hilton and Hertz.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/t-mobile-magenta-status.jpg" alt="" width="1250" height="625" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935555" /><br/>
Some of the deals include 15 percent off Hilton hotel brands, no fuel refills at drop off at Dollar Rental locations, one &#36;5 movie ticket per month, and 25 percent off some shows at Live Nation amphitheaters and venues.

		<description><![CDATA[Media platform Plex <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/welcome-to-rental-land-on-plex/">today announced</a> the launch of a dedicated movie rental store, allowing U.S. Plex users to purchase content directly from Plex rather than from a third-party store like YouTube, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, or Amazon Video.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/plex-movie-rental-store.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935551" /><br/>
Popular movies like Barbie, Aquaman, Mission Impossible, Wonka, Priscilla, and more can be purchased using Plex.<br/>
<br/>
Plex users will have 30 days to start playback after renting a movie, and once playback begins, the movie can be watched multiple times in a 48-hour window.<br/>
<br/>
Along with recent movies to purchase, Plex also offers a large selection of movies that are available to watch for free on demand (with ads), as well as free live television.<br/>
<br/>
Plex movies can be rented through the Plex Web App on iOS devices, but purchases work on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, iOS, the Plex Web App, Fire TV, and supported smart TVs from LG, Samsung, and more. Plex does not support renting movies directly on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, presumably to avoid Apple's cut.<br/>
<br/>
Rentals start at &#36;3.99 for older movies, but popular new releases cost up to &#36;20.99. Wonka, for example, is &#36;20.99, which is actually a dollar more than it costs to rent the movie from Apple's TV app. There is no option to purchase movies on Plex, and rented movies cannot be downloaded. <br/>
<br/>
Movie rentals are limited to the United States as of now, and Plex has not said whether the renting option will expand to additional countries.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/plex/">Plex</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/plex-launches-movie-rental-store/">Plex Launches Movie Rental Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/plex-launches-movie-rental-store.2418836/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 188 includes fixes and updates for Accessibility, Animations, Browser Changes, CSS, Forms, Loading, Lockdown Mode, Media, Rendering, Scrolling, Storage, SVG, Web API, Web Extensions, WebAuthn, WebGL, and WebRTC.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-188/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 188 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-188-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2418834/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, you can make hand gestures during video calls in the FaceTime app and other video conferencing apps to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-reaction-effects-facetime/">fill the screen with 3D effects</a>. For example, you can hold two thumbs up to show fireworks on the screen, or make two peace signs with your hands to show confetti.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/ios-17-facetime-effects.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1070" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900390" /><br/>
Unfortunately, many users are unaware that this new feature is turned on by default, leading to some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23916475/apple-video-reactions-telehealth-therapy-awkward-simplepractice">awkward and embarrassing moments</a> during important video calls, such as online therapy sessions and business meetings.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Apple has come up with a solution.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4, Apple is releasing a new API that allows video conferencing apps to turn off the gesture-based reactions by default in their apps, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>. We have not yet confirmed if Apple has also made the API available for macOS 14.4.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, and macOS 14.4 are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-beta-2/">currently in beta</a>, and the software updates are expected to be released in March.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and Apple Devices apps that Apple has been testing for Windows machines <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210384#619">have officially launched</a>, ending a long preview period and bringing an end to the iTunes app on some computers.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-880559" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/apple-music-preview-microsoft-store.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, and Apple Devices app are part of Apple's effort to split iTunes on PC into multiple platforms to mirror how these apps work on Macs. On Windows 10 and later, PC customers can download the three separate apps to manage devices and access &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; content.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/12/apple-music-apple-tv-icloud-photos-windows/">first announced plans</a> for &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; apps for the Microsoft Store back in October 2022, so the split from iTunes has been in the works for more than a year.<br/>
<br/>
Standalone <a class ="ads noskim" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PFHDD62MXS1?rtc=1&hl=en-us&gl=us">Apple Music</a>, <a class ="ads noskim" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NP83LWLPZ9K?hl=en-us&gl=US">Apple Devices</a>, and <a class ="ads noskim" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NM4T8B9JQZ1?hl=en-us&gl=US">Apple TV</a> apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/apple-music-tv-previews-microsoft-store/">launched in a preview capacity</a> in January 2023, and Apple has been making regular updates since then. As of today, the "Preview" label has been removed from the three Windows apps.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app gives Windows users a way to listen to and manage music from their iTunes library, including iTunes Store purchases, while the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app allows users to watch and manage movies and TV shows from iTunes. Both of the apps also give access to Apple's streaming services, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Devices app is designed to allow PC owners to update, back up, and restore and manage their iPhones and iPads, and sync content from their PCs.<br/>
<br/>
Using the standalone apps requires Windows 10 or later, and all three apps must be installed to transition away from iTunes. After the apps have been added to a PC, iTunes is used only to access podcasts and audiobooks. The iTunes library should not be deleted, because it is used by the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
PC users not able to update to Windows 10 can continue to use iTunes, but the new standalone apps offer a much more modern and simple-to-use experience that closer mirrors Mac interfaces.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-splits-itunes-for-windows/">Apple Officially Splits iTunes for Windows Into Apple Music, TV, and Devices Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-officially-splits-itunes-for-windows-into-apple-music-tv-and-devices-apps.2418812/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4 introduces some of the features in the iOS 17.4 beta, such as new emoji characters.

The iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 betas introduce a whole slew of changes for users in the European Union, allowing for alternative app stores and alternative payment methods.<br/>
<br/>
There are new options for choosing a default browser, NFC has been opened up to banks and other financial institutions, and browsers aren't mandated to use WebKit.<br/>
<br/>

In the spot, Ludacris, Lil Jon, and Taraji P.

The trio lets Cook know that they've "lost" Usher, and Cook tells them that they'll locate him.

		<description><![CDATA[As part of its compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) legislation, WhatsApp is putting the final touches to introducing platform interoperability with other encrypted messaging apps. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
In September, EU lawmakers designated WhatsApp parent company Meta as one of six so-called "gatekeepers," along with Google, Amazon, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">Apple</a>, ByteDance, and Microsoft, giving them six months to begin opening up their core platform services to others.<br/>
<br/>
The DMA comes into full effect in March 2024. That leaves just a few weeks for WhatsApp and others to bring their services into compliance. However, <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-interoperability-messaging/">Wired</a></em> reports that WhatsApp has actually been working on interoperability for the past two years, and its work is only partially motivated by the looming DMA.<br/>
<br/>
According to Dick Brouwer, an engineering director at WhatsApp, interoperability will initially focus on (non-SMS) text messaging, sending images, voice messages, videos, and files between two people. Calls and group chats will come in the next few years, as per the EU's rules.  <br/>
<br/>
Brouwer says users who opt-in to interoperability will see messages from other apps in a separate section at the top of their WhatsApp inbox. "The early thinking here is to put a separate inbox, given that these networks are very different," Brouwer says. "We cannot offer the same level of privacy and security," he told <em>Wired</em>. <br/>
<br/>
To send messages, third-party apps will need to encrypt content using the Signal Protocol, and then be packaged using XML, in compliance with the platform's existing client-server architecture. Apps will also need to connect to WhatsApp's servers to receive messages.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp will also allow other apps to use different encryption protocols if they can demonstrate they reach the security standards that WhatsApp outlines in its guidance. Third-party developers will also have an option to use a proxy between their apps and WhatsApp's servers. This could give developers more flexibility by removing the need for them to use WhatsApp's client-server protocols, but it also increases potential attack vectors, cautions Brouwer.<br/>
<br/>
Third-party chats appearing in WhatsApp could yet be some way off, however. Brouwer says the company is still working on the interoperability features and the level of support it will make available for companies wanting to integrate with it. Messaging companies that want to interoperate with WhatsApp will need to sign an agreement with the company and follow its terms. "Nobody quite knows how this works," Brouwer told <em>Wired</em>. "We have no idea what the demand is."<br/>
<br/>
The full details of the plan, which will apply to both WhatsApp and Messenger, will be published by Meta in March, and the company will have several months to implement it.<br/>
<br/>
"There's real tension between offering an easy way to offer this interoperability to third parties whilst at the same time preserving the WhatsApp privacy, security, and integrity bar," Brouwer admitted. "I think we're pretty happy with where we've landed," he added.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/">Encryption</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/whatsapp-interoperability-other-messaging-apps/">WhatsApp Working on Interoperability With Other Encrypted Messaging Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-working-on-interoperability-with-other-encrypted-messaging-apps.2418794/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup is set to see notable battery capacity changes across the board, according to the X user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Perspective-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-935281" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1755230167155261939?s=20">new post</a>, Majin Bu claims that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max will feature larger batteries than their predecessors, but the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus is set to take a significant step back in terms of battery capacity. The X user also noted that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max is moving away from the L-shaped battery design used on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max and earlier toward a standard rectangular battery like the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. The rumored changes are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>

 <td>4,676 mAh</td><br/>
 <td>+5%</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Majin Bu did not disclose any information about the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s battery. It is not clear why the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus's battery would shrink compared to its predecessor while the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;'s battery grows, seeing as both devices have an identical feature-set and share many of their components.<br/>
<br/>
While Majin Bu often aggregates and shares information related to Apple's plans, they do not have a solid track record. As a result, this part of the rumor should be treated with some skepticism until we know more, but it is worth noting that a smaller battery would not necessarily equate to reduced battery life, since there could be efficiency savings elsewhere that prolong battery life.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">Some iPhone 16 Models Rumored to Feature Bigger Batteries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-iphone-16-models-rumored-to-feature-bigger-batteries.2418786/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iFixit today shared the second part of its <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/90409/vision-pro-teardown-part-2-whats-the-display-resolution?">teardown</a> of Apple's Vision Pro headset, revealing several new insights about the device's construction, specifications, and repairability. Its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/ifixit-apple-vision-pro-teardown/">initial disassembly</a> provided the first comprehensive look at the device's internals last week.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wt22M5nWJ4Q?si=C1wB4HP0YLu85W7R" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
iFixit examined the Vision Pro's microOLED display panels, also known as OLED on Silicon. Despite not technically having 4K resolution, the displays boast an incredible pixel density, with more than 50 Vision Pro pixels fitting into the space of a single <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> pixel. This density translates to an estimated 3,386 pixels per inch and 34 pixels per degree, offering a rich visual experience that, while not 4K by conventional standards, exceeds the pixel count of a 4K TV.  <br/>
<br/>
The logic board of the Vision Pro houses the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip and R1 co-processor, designed to manage the real-time data from the headset's numerous sensors. This includes outward-facing cameras, TrueDepth sensors, LiDAR sensors, IR illuminators, and IR cameras.<br/>
<br/>
The teardown also highlights the Vision Pro's battery design, which, despite being "over-engineered" and difficult to open without damage, contains a range of hardware features such as temperature sensors and an accelerometer. The bespoke "big Lightning" cable outputs more voltage than a standard USB-C pack to meet the Vision Pro's processing demands. iFixit managed to design its own battery pack to circumvent the restrictions of Apple's design, providing double the battery life of the included pack.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit revealed that the Vision Pro is relatively free from parts pairing, a common practice in Apple products that restricts repairability. This means components can be swapped between headsets without triggering "unrecognized part" warnings, a key benefit for repair enthusiasts and professionals. <br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro's repairability presents a mixed bag. On the plus side, its battery is modular, and parts that come into contact with the user's skin are easily replaceable. The lens inserts and light seals attach magnetically, simplifying the fitting process. Yet, the headset's front glass poses a significant vulnerability. Its fragility means that even fully functional sensors become useless with a cracked display, affecting the headset's overall durability and user experience. Comparatively, rival headsets from Meta offer a more durable design with exterior shells made of plastic and recessed cameras protected by a separate notch, making them significantly more robust than the Vision Pro. Overall, iFixit awards the Vision Pro a provisional repairability score of 4 out of 10. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/">Teardown</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/ifixit-vision-pro-displays-and-repairability/">iFixit Examines Apple Vision Pro&#039;s Displays, Battery, and Repairability</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-examines-apple-vision-pros-displays-battery-and-repairability.2418783/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is actively building prototypes of at least two foldable iPhones following over five years of research and development, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-develops-a-foldable-clamshell-iphone?"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/foldable-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="1995" height="1057" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-872750" /><br/>
Citing individuals with "direct knowledge" of the project, the two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> prototypes reportedly fold widthwise like a clamshell. The devices are in early development and do not feature in the company's mass production plans for 2024 or 2025, making 2026 the earliest possible launch time frame. The company has, however, approached at least one supplier in Asia for components related to two foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models that come in different sizes. The report added that the foldable iPhones could still be canceled if they do not meet Apple's standards.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's interest in offering a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is said to have fluctuated over the years. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> apparently first asked designers and engineers about a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as early as 2018. Later that year, he responded positively to a demonstration of a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a 7-inch display. The company is reportedly concerned about technical challenges and offering sufficiently appealing features on the device that would justify its high price point compared to non-foldable devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's initial vision for the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; imagined the display residing on the outside when the phone is shut, but engineers struggled to address durability problems with this design. The industrial design team also wanted the device to be no thicker than current &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models when closed, which became untenable due to limitations with battery and display technology.<br/>
<br/>
The company paused its work on a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; around 2020 and pivoted toward an inward folding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> around the size of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, featuring an 8-inch display. Apple purportedly concluded that the device could be thicker than a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; since users would not expect to carry it in their pocket and it would not need to pass the high durability requirements of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. An foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; would also enable Apple to publicly test the product category on a smaller scale.<br/>
<br/>
Engineers are currently attempting to eliminate the crease that forms in the middle of the display due to repeated folding, as well as design a hinge that allows the display to lie totally flat, rather than possessing a small bump or dip in the middle, which could inhibit the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>. The company is reportedly working with LG and Samsung on displays for the foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-continuing-work-on-folding-iphones/">Apple Continuing Work on Folding iPhones, No Launch Until at Least 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continuing-work-on-folding-iphones-no-launch-until-at-least-2026.2418780/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Along with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/visionos-1-1-beta-improved-personas/">improved Personas</a>, the update adds iMessage Contact Key Verification to the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>

iMessage Contact Key Verification is an optional security feature that allows you to manually verify who you are messaging with by comparing verification codes in person or on a phone call. The feature launched on the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-imessage-contact-key-verification/">starting with iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2, watchOS 9.2, and macOS 14.2</a> last year.<br/>

iMessage Contact Key Verification also includes "advanced protections" that can help prevent attackers from impersonating anyone in a conversation, according to Apple. These protections only apply if both parties in an iMessage conversation have turned on the feature.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple researchers have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17102">released</a> a new open-source AI model that is capable of editing images based on a user's natural language instructions (via <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/apple-releases-mgie-a-revolutionary-ai-model-for-instruction-based-image-editing/"><em>VentureBeat</em></a>). <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/DALL·E-apple-logo-image-editing-ai.jpg" alt="" width="1792" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935389" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>MacRumors image made with DALL·E</em></div><br/>
Called "MGIE," which stands for MLLM-Guided Image Editing, it uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interpret user requests and perform pixel-level manipulations. <br/>
<br/>
The model is capable of editing various aspects of images. Global photo enhancements can include brightness, contrast, or sharpness, or the application of artistic effects like sketching. Local editing can modify the shape, size, color, or texture of specific regions or objects in an image, while Photoshop-style modifications can include cropping, resizing, rotating, and adding filters, or even changing backgrounds and blending images.<br/>
<br/>
A user input for a photo of a pizza could be to "make it look more healthy." Using common sense reasoning, the model can add vegetable toppings, such as tomatoes and herbs. A global optimization input request might take the form of "add contrast to simulate more light," while a Photoshop-style modification could be made by asking the model to remove people from the background of a photo, shifting the focus of the image to the subject's facial expression. <br/>
<br/>
Apple collaborated with University of California researchers to create MGIE, which was presented in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17102.pdf">paper</a> at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024. The model is available on GitHub, and includes the code, data, and pre-trained models. <br/>

This is Apple's second breakthrough in AI research in as many months. In late December, Apple revealed that it had made strides in deploying large language models (LLMs) on iPhones and other Apple devices with limited memory by inventing an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-ai-researchers-run-llms-iphones/">innovative flash memory utilization technique</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For the last several months, Apple has been testing an "Apple GPT" rival that could compete with ChatGPT. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, work on AI is a priority for Apple, with the company designing an "Ajax" framework for large language models.<br/>
<br/>
Both <em>The Information</em> and analyst Jeff Pu claim that Apple will have some kind of generative AI feature available on the ‌iPhone‌ and iPad <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">around late 2024</a>, which is when iOS 18 will be coming out. iOS 18 is said to include an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">enhanced version of Siri</a> with ChatGPT-like generative AI functionality, and has the potential to be the "biggest" software update in the iPhone's history, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/ios-18-biggest-update-rumor/">according to Gurman</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-ai-model-edits-images-natural-language/">New Apple AI Model Edits Images Based on Natural Language Input</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-ai-model-edits-images-based-on-natural-language-input.2418775/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://bsky.app">Bluesky</a>, the decentralized social media platform conceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has now opened registration for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/bluesky.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935373" /><br/>
On Tuesday, the emerging X and Threads competitor said it was ending its invite-only system, which has managed to gain it over three million users since it debuted a year ago. The public benefit company, which has just under 40 full-time staff, has been busy building out its moderation features and achieving better stability during is closed beta period.<br/>
<br/>
Users who install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199">Bluesky Social app</a> or visit <a href="https://bsky.app">bsky.app</a> will be able to sign up and join the conversation platform, which should look familiar to users of the old Twitter – a feed to which people can post messages up to 300 characters long as well as photos and video.<br/>
<br/>
The difference with Bluesky is that its servers use a decentralized Authenticated Transport (AT) Protocol that will allow users to opt-in to a microblogging experience that isn't run by the company, allowing them to create an account under a given domain name and then use their profile in rival apps that use the same network.<br/>
<br/>
Another advantage of the AT protocol is that it can operate based more on a user's preferences than algorithmically driven content, with user-curated feeds that people can use to find other users or topics, with customizable moderation tools also available to them. <br/>
<br/>
AT will rival ActivityPub, the decentralized protocol powering Mastodon, and soon, Meta's Threads enabling interoperability between the two platforms. Later this month, Bluesky will also begin allowing outside developers to host their own servers on the AT Protocol and create their own rules.<br/>
<br/>
In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24062837/bluesky-drops-invite-system-begins-federation-at-protocol">The Verge</a></em>, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber said Bluesky's profit stream will eventually include charging users for additional features in its app, as well as taking a commission on purchases like custom feeds that developers will be able to sell as digital products.<br/>
<br/>
The Bluesky Social app is a free download for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199">Direct Link</a>].<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bluesky/">Bluesky</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/bluesky-ends-closed-beta-period/">Bluesky Social Network Ditches Invite Codes, Opens Registrations to All</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bluesky-social-network-ditches-invite-codes-opens-registrations-to-all.2418762/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-releases-first-beta-of-visionos-1-1/">first developer beta of visionOS 1.1</a> for the Vision Pro, and the update improves the look of Personas.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Persona-Prompt-visionOS-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1109" height="624" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935361" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>visionOS 1.1 prompt to recapture your Persona via <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanmcd8">Dylan McDonald</a></em></div><br/>
After installing visionOS 1.1, Vision Pro users are immediately prompted to recapture their Personas to get the "latest appearance updates" included in the update. Some users shared screenshots of their updated Personas in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=visionos%201.1%20persona">social media posts</a> today, and the new versions generally appear to be more detailed and lifelike.<br/>
<br/>
Apple still labels Personas as a "beta" feature on visionOS 1.1, and hopefully it will continue to improve the way they look over time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Quinn-Nelson-Persona.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935357" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Quinn-Nelson-Old-Persona.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="873" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935366" /><div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@snazzy">Quinn Nelson</a>'s updated Persona (top) and original Persona (bottom)</em></div><br/>
As a refresher, Apple says a Persona is an "authentic spatial representation" of a person that shows their facial expressions and hand movements in real time. Personas fill in for you during video calls on the Vision Pro, since the headset covers your actual face. When you set up a Persona, your eyes are also captured for the EyeSight feature, which allows others to see a render of your eyes on the Vision Pro's outward display.<br/>
