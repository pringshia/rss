		<description><![CDATA[Over 800 days have passed since Apple last updated the iPad mini, as outlined in the <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">MacRumors Buyer's Guide</a>. Fortunately, a new iPad mini is rumored to be released next year, and we have outlined what to expect from the device below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ipad-mini-2021-youtube.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816317" /><br/>
Apple released the current iPad mini in September 2021, with new features at the time including a larger 8.3-inch display, a USB-C port, a Touch ID power button, the A15 Bionic chip, 5G support on cellular models, a 12-megapixel rear camera with Center Stage support, compatibility with the second-generation Apple Pencil, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Launch Timing</h2><br/>
Apple is aiming to begin mass production of the seventh-generation iPad mini at some point <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/">in the second half of 2024</a>, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, meaning the device would be manufactured in July or later. Apple rarely announces new products in July or August, so the next iPad mini will most likely be unveiled in September or October next year based on the rumored production timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Expected Features</h2><br/>
<ul><li>As part of a routine spec bump, the next iPad mini will likely be equipped with a faster <strong>A16 Bionic chip</strong> at a minimum.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Upgraded front and rear cameras</strong> are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">rumored</a> for the new iPad mini. The current model has a 12-megapixel rear camera with an ƒ/1.8 aperture and a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera with an ƒ/2.4 aperture.</li><br/>
<li><strong>New color options</strong> are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">rumored</a> for the new iPad mini. The current ‌model is available in Space Gray, Starlight, Pink, and Purple.</li><br/>
<li>It is likely that the next iPad mini will support <strong>Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3</strong>, enabling faster Wi-Fi speeds with a supported router, and improved Bluetooth connectivity. Apple already added Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 support to the latest iPad Pro, iPhone 15 Pro models, and most new Macs.</li><br/>
<li>The new iPad mini is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">rumored</a> to have a rotated screen assembly to <strong>reduce the effect of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/28/apple-jelly-scrolling-normal-behavior/">"jelly scrolling"</a></strong> screen tearing in portrait orientation. This visual effect can cause text or images on one side of the screen to appear to be tilted downwards because of a mismatch in refresh rates.</li></ul>Read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini roundup</a> for more details.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/24/what-to-expect-from-the-next-ipad-mini/">What to Expect From the Next iPad Mini Later in 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-the-next-ipad-mini-later-in-2024.2411934/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with GRID Studio to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 512GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. GRID Studio, for those unfamiliar, is a company that takes discarded Apple devices and turns them into wall art.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919076" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-1.jpg" alt="" width="1348" height="759" /><br/>
Each GRID piece has a deconstructed Apple device with the components artfully displayed, with a sleek black frame to complement the parts. Labels make it clear what each part of the device was used for, and interesting and relevant details are included. There are a range different GRID Studio options that feature iPhones, iPads, and iPods, with prices that start at &#36;40 and go up based on the complexity of the piece.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">GRID 1</a>, one of GRID Studio's most popular options, showcases the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that Apple ever made. Priced at &#36;400, it features all of the components that Apple used for the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; back in 2007. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌'s shell is positioned next to the power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components. GRID does not include the original batteries from the device, but replicas are added so the battery is not missing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/grid-studio-grid-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902133" /><br/>
The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s">GRID 4s</a> is another iconic device that's available at a special price For Black Friday. Right now, it's just &#36;99, down from the original &#36;170 price tag. The Grid 4s has around 40 components from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4s, all of which are neatly arranged and labeled.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909377" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-iPhone4s.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
GRID Studio's <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-5">&#36;139 GRID 5</a> shows off the internal components from the 2012 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 is notable because it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that was developed under Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, and the last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple CEO Steve Jobs was directly involved with. Compared to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4s, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 brought a taller 4-inch display and it was also the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to feature a Lightning port.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919078" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-iPhone-5.jpg" alt="" width="1816" height="1022" /><br/>
<br/>
Priced at &#36;269, the <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/apple-iphone-x">GRID X</a> features one of Apple's newer iPhones, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X was the first to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> instead of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, doing away with the Home button. It included the notch housing the TrueDepth camera system. The 2017 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X inspired all of the modern Apple iPhones with its all-display design.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/grid-studio-iphone-x.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923779" /><br/>
GRID Studio also offers bundles at a discount, such as the &#36;299 <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/classic-kits-4s-5-6">GRID Classic Kit</a>, which is available at this price point for a limited time. The GRID Classic Kit features the GRID 4, GRID 5, and GRID 6, highlighting all of the design changes Apple introduced from 2011 to 2013. This 3-in-1 deal is a good option if you're looking for some sleek office art.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/grid-studio-iphone-6.jpg" alt="" width="1070" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923778" /><br/>
GRID Studio has <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/">additional products on its website</a>, including other &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; options and devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and the Apple Watch. GRID is having a Black Friday sale this week, with customers able to get 15 percent off storewide with the discount code BF15.<br/>

There are also still a few "mystery boxes" that can include hundreds of dollars in savings, if you're willing to risk not knowing what you're buying ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/anker-new-xmas.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923261" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Anker. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
In terms of the base sale, there are plenty of great accessories that you can buy to take advantage of the savings. A new highlight is the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/products/b1336-20000mah-power-bank-kit?ref=black-friday-sale&amp;variant=42726143852694">Prime 20,000 mAh Power Bank with 100W Charging Base</a> for &#36;129.50, down from &#36;184.99. If you just want a portable battery with a smart display, the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1289?ref=black-friday-sale&amp;variant=41974285041814">PowerCore 24,000 mAh Power Bank with Smart Digital Display</a> is at &#36;92.00, down from &#36;159.99.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO 60% OFF</div>Anker Black Friday Sale</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
At the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu">bottom of the Black Friday sale page</a>, Anker also has a few blind boxes on sale, priced at &#36;19.99 (up to &#36;219.99 in value) and at &#36;29.99 (up to &#36;219.99 in value). These mystery boxes include one Anker accessory, but you won't know what you're getting until they arrive. All items in the &#36;19.99 box are worth more than &#36;19.99, and all items in the &#36;29.99 box are worth more than &#36;29.99, so no matter what you'll be getting a deal.<br/>
<br/>
All mystery box items are non-returnable (with the exception of quality issues). These could net you a huge discount with a collection of solid stocking stuffers for the holidays, if you're willing to take the blind box risk. Anker's Black Friday sale will run through December 3.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung has expanded its <a href="https://howl.me/ck3cNcgXTyo">Black Friday sale</a> with new discounts across smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, computers, and home appliances. This is in addition to the deals we've been tracking on Samsung's best TVs and monitors, like the Smart Monitor M8 and ViewFinity S9 5K Display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/samsung-best-holiday.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923404" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Right now, both of these have all-time low prices on Amazon. The Smart Monitor M8 is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0C3WMX69W%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26smid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a> (&#36;300 off) and the ViewFinity S9 5K Display is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-ViewFinity-Thunderbolt-DisplayPort-LS27C900PANXZA%2Fdp%2FB0CB71BY87%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3%3Fcrid%3D2UE1OI1RNSBZ3%26keywords%3Dsamsung%2Bviewfinity%2Bs9%26qid%3D1700578795%26sprefix%3Dsamsung%2Bviewfinity%252Caps%252C133%26sr%3D8-3"><strong>&#36;1,249.00</strong></a> (&#36;350 off). The latter deal has been fluctuating on Amazon, so if it does disappear, Samsung has a solid second-best offer at <a href="https://howl.me/ck3bAoFu1ed">&#36;1,299.99</a> for the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ck3cNcgXTyo"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">SITEWIDE SALE</div>Samsung Black Friday</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Samsung is encouraging users to shop through the Shop Samsung mobile app this season, which has some exclusive deals and deep discounts on smartphones, smartwatches, and mobile accessories. Clicking any of the Samsung links in this post while on mobile should give you the option to install the app.<br/>
<br/>
Other than monitors and TVs, we're also now tracking quite a few deals on refrigerators, tablets, and computers below. These sale prices will be live for this week only, so be sure to check out Samsung's event before the best prices of the year disappear.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy's <a href="https://howl.me/ck3ASx7u9vB">Black Friday event</a> has some of the best Apple deals online today, including record low prices on Apple's entire line of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro computers. Additionally, we're seeing great deals on TVs, audio equipment, smart home products, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Aqara's Camera E1 is a new addition to the smart home camera space, offering a range of key features including 2K resolution, pan and tilt, support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/">HomeKit Secure Video</a>, and more. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Aqara-Camera-E1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-923909" /><br/>
The Camera E1 emerges as a noteworthy option in Aqara's lineup of smart home cameras, especially for those seeking a balance between functionality and affordability. Priced at &#36;59.99, this camera positions itself in a competitive spot in the market, particularly for a device with 2K resolution, pan and tilt, and &zwnj;HomeKit Secure Video&zwnj; support. <br/>
<br/>
The Aqara Camera E1 boasts a sleek and modern design. Its compact form factor makes it suitable for various placements around the home. Whether placed on a shelf or mounted on a wall, the camera can be easily adjusted to capture the desired view.<br/>
<br/>
The camera features a privacy mode, which physically reorients the camera lens away from the viewing area. This design choice reassures users through its visible action — a clear indicator that the camera is not recording or monitoring.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/aqara-camera-e1-box.jpeg" alt="" width="3000" height="1688" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-923910" /><br/>
Setting up the Aqara Camera E1 with Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> is straightforward. With the Camera E1 powered and placed in its intended location, setup begins by scanning the &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; setup code found on the camera, like many other smart home accessories. This can be done directly through the Home app by tapping "Add Accessory" and using the iOS device's camera to scan the code.<br/>
<br/>
Once the camera is recognized by the Home app, it prompts you to assign the camera to a room and give it a name. While you can adjust settings such as the status light and stream quality via the Home app, setting up the Camera E1 directly with &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; might limit access to some of its features compared to the full range available through the Aqara Home app. Essential functionalities such as live streaming, two-way audio, and motion-triggered notifications are still accessible in the Home app. <br/>
<br/>
The camera features a 2K video resolution, which provides exceptionally clear and detailed images and sets it apart from many HomeKit-compatible cameras that only offer 1080p. This high resolution, combined with a wide-angle f/2.0 lens, ensures that users receive a clear and comprehensive view of their home environment.<br/>
<br/>
The Camera E1 is also equipped with concealed infrared night vision. The invisible infrared LEDs ensure that the camera can capture clear footage even in low-light conditions without the obtrusive glow often associated with night vision cameras.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/aqara-camera-e1.jpeg" alt="" width="3200" height="1800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-923911" /><br/>
Unlike many &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; cameras in this price range, the Aqara Camera E1 offers pan and tilt capabilities, greatly expanding its field of view and monitoring capabilities. The mechanism operates very quietly, ensuring that the camera's movements are discreet.<br/>
<br/>
The Camera E1 supports &zwnj;HomeKit Secure Video&zwnj;, enabling it to detect distinct motion types such as people, animals, and vehicles, and store the recorded footage securely in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>. Users can tailor notifications to their preferences based on the type of motion detected. <br/>
<br/>
Like many Aqara accessories, the Camera E1 appears to have very steady network connection and good stream quality. Compared directly to a Logi Circle View, it performed noticeably better on the network. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Final Thoughts and How to Buy</h3><br/>
Overall, Aqara's Camera E1 is a compelling HomeKit-compatible smart home camera at an affordable price point. With its 2K resolution, pan and tilt, the ability to physically reorient for privacy, reliable network connectivity, and support for &zwnj;HomeKit Secure Video&zwnj;, the Camera E1 is a robust addition to any smart home set up.<br/>
<br/>
Buyers should be aware that &zwnj;HomeKit Secure Video&zwnj; is limited to 1080p resolution, meaning that if this is your main use-case, you will be unable to take full advantage of the camera's hardware. In addition, like many &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; accessories, far more expansive capabilities are offered by the manufacturer's own app, with only limited control in the Home app. <br/>
<br/>
The Aqara Camera E1 is available from <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAqara-Security-HomeKit-Tracking-Supports%2Fdp%2FB0CCHQ38D2">Amazon in North America</a> and Europe, as well as <a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/where-to-buy.html">selected Aqara retailers worldwide</a>, for &#36;59.99.<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Sonos very rarely offers straight cash discounts on individual products, with typical sales throughout the year focusing on bundle sales. For Black Friday, the company is finally back with steep markdowns on numerous products, and you don't need to bundle or enter a code for the savings.<br/>

<h2>Anker</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/anker-snowflakes.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923707" /><br/>
<br/>
Anker's biggest sale of the year kicked off earlier this week, with up to 60 percent off sitewide for Black Friday. Additionally, Anker has a few "mystery boxes" that can include hundreds of dollars in savings, if you're willing to risk not knowing what you're buying ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of the base sale, there are plenty of great accessories that you can buy to take advantage of the savings. A new highlight is the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/products/b1336-20000mah-power-bank-kit?ref=black-friday-sale&amp;variant=42726143852694">Prime 20,000 mAh Power Bank with 100W Charging Base</a> for &#36;129.50, down from &#36;184.99. If you just want a portable battery with a smart display, the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1289?ref=black-friday-sale&amp;variant=41974285041814">PowerCore 24,000 mAh Power Bank with Smart Digital Display</a> is at &#36;92.00, down from &#36;159.99.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO 60% OFF</div>Anker Black Friday</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
At the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu">bottom of the Black Friday sale page</a>, Anker also has a few blind boxes on sale, priced at &#36;19.99 (up to &#36;219.99 in value) and at &#36;29.99 (up to &#36;219.99 in value). These mystery boxes include one Anker accessory, but you won't know what you're getting until they arrive. All items in the &#36;19.99 box are worth more than &#36;19.99, and all items in the &#36;29.99 box are worth more than &#36;29.99, so no matter what you'll be getting a deal.<br/>
<br/>
All mystery box items are non-returnable (with the exception of quality issues). These could net you a huge discount with a collection of solid stocking stuffers for the holidays, if you're willing to take the blind box risk. Anker's Black Friday sale will run through December 3.<br/>

<a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-13761603?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fdeals%2F">AT&T</a> has introduced a number of sales for Apple's iPhone 15 this month, offering up to &#36;1,000 off the <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-13761603?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fapple-iphone-15-pro.html">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-13761603?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fapple-iphone-15-pro-max.html">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> with an eligible smartphone trade-in. Models with lower storage capacities can be purchased at no cost thanks to these discounts, and of course you'll need to purchase the new smartphone on a qualifying installment agreement. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-15-colors-holiday.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920875" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-13761603?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fapple-iphone-15-pro.html"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO &#36;1,000 OFF</div>iPhone 15 Pro at AT&T</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
You can get up to &#36;830 off the <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-13761603?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fapple-iphone-15.html">iPhone 15</a> or <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-13761603?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fapple-iphone-15-plus.html">iPhone 15 Plus</a> as well, with the same stipulations as the Pro devices. Both offers will be delivered via monthly bill credits, starting within three bills after trade-in is completed. It'll be applied in equal amounts over the term of your installment agreement.<br/>
<br/>
For the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max offer, you'll need to trade in a device with a value of &#36;230 or higher to get the full &#36;1,000 off markdown. You'll get up to &#36;830 in bill credits with a trade-in value of &#36;130 to &#36;229 and up to &#36;350 in bill credits with a trade-in value of &#36;35 to &#36;129.<br/>
<br/>
For older iPhone models, AT&T is offering the 128GB <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-13761603?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fapple-iphone-14.html">iPhone 14 at &#36;10.99/month</a> with no trade-in required. Similarly, the iPhone 14 Pro is available at &#36;15/month with no trade-in required. For these, all you'll need is to purchase the smartphones on an installment plan and pick or upgrade to an eligible unlimited plan.<br/>
<br/>
AT&T is also taking <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-13761603?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2F">&#36;300 off any Apple Watch</a> when you purchase two at the same time. Like smartphone plans, you'll have to buy two Apple Watches on an installment plan, add at least one new line, and activate both on your wireless plan. Afterwards, you'll get up to &#36;300 in bill credits over 36 months.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="verizon">Verizon</h2><br/>
At <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-11557999?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2F">Verizon</a>, you can get a special bundle offer if you're interested in purchasing the new <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple-iphone-15-pro%2F">iPhone 15 Pro</a> this holiday season. When you do pick up the new smartphone with a new line on an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan, Verizon will reward you with an Apple TV 4K (64GB) and six months of Apple One at no cost.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-15-green-holiday.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920876" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple-iphone-15-pro%2F"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">FREE APPLE TV 4K</div>iPhone 15 Pro at Verizon</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can purchase <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple%2F">higher storage iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max models</a>, but at that point you'll be paying a little extra. The Apple TV 4K promotion requires a smarpthone purchase on an eligible plan and ends on November 15, while the Apple One six month promotion requires a line subscribed to an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan.<br/>
<br/>
For last year's models, you can <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple-iphone-14-plus%2F">get four iPhone 14 Plus devices for free</a> along with four lines on Unlimited Welcome at &#36;120/month. A new line on any 5G Unlimited plan is required per smartphone. You can also stack this with Verizon's current tablet and smartwatch promotions, which offer up to &#36;279.99 off these devices.<br/>
<br/>
Verizon is also a great place to buy stocking stuffers for techies during the holiday season with its abundant <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-14048362?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fdeals%2Fproducts%2F">accessory sales</a>. Right now it has up to &#36;50 off Anker speakers, 30% off Nimble chargers, 20% off Apple Watch bands, and 20% off Mophie chargers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="visible">Visible</h2><br/>
Verizon's <a href="https://visible.pxf.io/c/153062/1007955/12909">Visible</a> brand has &#36;10 off its premium Visible+ service, now priced at &#36;35/month with the promo code 35FOR6 used at checkout. This promotion will last for six months, and after it ends it will return to the regular price of &#36;45/month for the Visible+ service.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://visible.pxf.io/c/153062/1007955/12909"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;10 OFF/MONTH</div>Visible+ Cellular Plan</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Visible offers all of the latest smartphones, including iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models. When you join Visible, you'll save up to &#36;240 via monthly bill credits on your account. You'll need to join Visible on a new line of service, purchase a new device, and select the Visible+ plan.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="t-mobile">T-Mobile</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phones/brand/apple?icid=MGPO_TMO_P_23HOLIIP15_ACF7436252B5D95636519">T-Mobile</a> is providing up to &#36;1,000 off the new iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro when you trade in an eligible device on a Go5G Next plan. You can get up to &#36;830 off these devices when you trade in an eligible device on a Go5G Plus plan.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phones/brand/apple?icid=MGPO_TMO_P_23HOLIIP15_ACF7436252B5D95636519"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO &#36;1,000 OFF</div>iPhone 15 at T-Mobile</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The carrier also has a wide variety of previous generation iPhones at a discount. This includes the iPhone 13 and iPhone SE at no extra cost when purchased on select cellular plans and trading in eligible devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="accessories">Accessories</h2><br/>
To cap things off, we're pointing out some great iPhone accessories that you can find on sale at Amazon and <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Fplus%2Fnew-apple-accessory-blowout%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_gw_dly_snb">Woot</a>. Woot's sale has the MagSafe Charger and MagSafe Duo Charger at all-time low prices, but these have been fluctuating since the beginning of November. If they're gone when you check, be sure to try again sometime soon.<br/>

We originally tracked the AirPods 2 for &#36;69.00 at Amazon in early November, but that sale quickly expired. Amazon now has this model for &#36;89.99, down from &#36;129.00. This version of the AirPods is perfect for anyone on your holiday shopping list who may be asking for a simple and reliable pair of wireless earbuds, particularly at this insanely low price tag. <br/>

Amazon has the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case for &#36;139.99, down from &#36;169.00. These are upgraded in a few ways from the AirPods 2, with spatial audio, Adaptive EQ, force sensor controls, sweat and water resistance, and more.<br/>
<br/>

Moving to the Pro lineup, Amazon has the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case for &#36;189.99, which is a match of the all-time low price on this model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>

Lastly, the high-end AirPods Max are available for &#36;449.99 on Amazon, down from &#36;549.00. Discounts on the AirPods Max have been rare over the past few months, so this one is a second-best price on the over-ear headphones.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With all the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/22/apple-black-friday-now-wednesday-2023/">discounted deals on Apple tech</a> currently available, you might be thinking about upgrading your Apple Watch or buying one for the first time. But if your current smartwatch is doing its job just fine and it's only the idea of a good deal that's piqued your interest, it could be worth holding out until next year when Apple unveils its latest and greatest version.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
There are already several rumors from reputable sources that suggest 2024 could be a very big year for the Apple Watch. Here are five reasons to hold onto your wallet for now and wait until the next-generation model arrives.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Major Redesign</h2><br/>
The original Apple Watch was released in April 2015, and we are coming up on the 10th anniversary of Apple's first wearable device. With such a landmark anniversary on the horizon, rumors suggest a notable 10-year anniversary update could arrive as early as 2024. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-X-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906752" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is planning a major redesign for the Apple Watch to coincide with its 10th anniversary. Apple is said to be aiming to make the Apple Watch thinner than it is now, with a slimmer casing, along with different ways to attach bands. The new bands could attach to the watch magnetically, which would free up space inside the Apple Watch for bigger batteries and other internal components.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>microLED Display</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/cheaper-airpods-and-micro-led-apple-watch-rumors/">Analyst Jeff Pu</a> and display analyst Ross Young believe Apple is working on a new high-end watch that will feature a 2.1-inch (diagonal) micro-LED display. The watch is rumored to be coming in 2024 or 2025, although it could be an upgrade to the Apple Watch Ultra rather than the Series 9.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/apple-watch-series-9-display.jpeg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913380" /><br/>
That said, Apple could be planning multiple sizes, or the rumored "Apple Watch X" could be a larger-sized watch with a new case design and slimmer bezels. MicroLED is more energy efficient than the OLED technology currently used in Apple Watch models. It also has a longer lifetime, faster response times, better contrast, and brighter colors.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Blood Pressure Monitoring</h2><br/>
Apple plans to add blood pressure monitoring to the Apple Watch in 2024, according to Bloomberg's Gurman. The blood pressure monitoring featuring will reportedly let users know if their blood pressure is trending upward. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/Apple-Watch-Pro-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2110" height="1186" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-860620" /><br/>
As opposed to the common methods that measure blood pressure using an inflatable cuff wrapped around the upper arm, Apple's system is believed to measure the speed of the wave of a heartbeat through a user's arteries using sensors. However, it may not provide exact systolic and diastolic measurements initially.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Hypertension Detection</h2><br/>
As part of Apple's new blood pressure monitoring system, the Apple Watch is also expected to detect episodes of hypertension, or abnormally high blood pressure, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/carbon-fiber-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920793" /><br/>
The system will provide an option for users to note what they were doing when the hypertension occurred, which could be useful for medical diagnosis. And to avoid potentially giving a misdiagnosis, the Apple Watch will direct the user to talk to their doctor or check their blood pressure with a traditional cuff, which can provide exact systolic and diastolic measurements.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Sleep Apnea Detection</h2><br/>
Also coming in 2024 is an Apple Watch-based sleep apnea detection feature. Sleep apnea is sleeping disorder in which the temporary cessation of breathing occurs more often than normal during sleep. It can cause hypoxemia and sleep deprivation. Symptoms include loud snoring and making choking noises during your sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/watchos-9-sleep-stage-tracking.jpg" alt="" width="2672" height="1502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-849841" /><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/2024-apple-watch-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea/">November 2023 report</a>, the Apple Watch will use sleep history and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition, and then direct users to see a physician.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Release</h2><br/>
Apple typically releases a new Apple Watch model in September alongside the launch of its latest flagship iPhone, which in 2024 will be the iPhone 16. Apple could however have something different planned if it does indeed unveil a 10th anniversary "Apple Watch X" next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-Updated-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922680" /><br/>
It's worth noting that the original Apple Watch was unveiled in September 2014, but it did not release until April 2015, so Apple could use either date for the Apple Watch anniversary. Given that 2023 marked the debut of the Apple Watch Series 9, a Series 10 or "X" would be more appropriate for 2024, not 2025, but the X naming is just speculation at this point.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/24/2024-apple-watch-exciting-rumors/">5 Reasons to Wait for Next Year&#039;s Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/5-reasons-to-wait-for-next-years-apple-watch.2411875/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple released the current iPad Air in March 2022, with then-new features including the M1 chip, 5G connectivity on cellular models, an upgraded 12-megapixel front camera with support for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212315">Center Stage</a>, up to a 2x faster USB-C port for wired data transfer, and new color options like purple and blue. The device is equipped with a 10.9-inch display, and Touch ID fingerprint authentication built into the power button.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to be planning two new iPad Air models for release in the first half of 2024, with more details about the devices outlined below.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Expected Features</h2><br/>
<h3>12.9" Model</h3><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/">planning new 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Air models</a>, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, meaning the device would be available in multiple display sizes for the first time. Kuo said the devices will still have a traditional LCD panel without mini-LED backlighting, but he expects the 12.9-inch model to be equipped with an "oxide" backplane for improved display performance compared to the current iPad Air.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the larger display option, there have not been any rumors about major external design changes for the next iPad Air models.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M2 Chip</h3><br/>
The next iPad Air models are likely to be equipped with Apple's M2 chip for additional performance and power efficiency improvements over the M1 chip in the current model. Apple already updated the iPad Pro with the M2 chip in October 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3</h3><br/>
It is very likely that the next iPad Air models will support Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, enabling faster Wi-Fi speeds with a supported router, and improved Bluetooth connectivity. Apple has already added Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 support to the latest iPad Pro, iPhone 15 Pro models, and most new Macs.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Launch Timing</h2><br/>
Kuo said the new 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Air models are scheduled for mass production in the first quarter of 2024, meaning that the devices should launch at some point in the first half of the year. March is a common month for Apple to announce new products, as is June during Apple's annual developers conference WWDC.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/23/what-to-expect-from-2024-ipad-air/">What to Expect From the Next iPad Air in Early 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-the-next-ipad-air-in-early-2024.2411843/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 is still over seven months away from being announced, but there are already a few rumors and expectations for the software update. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" /><br/>
iOS 18 should be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC next June, and released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September. Below, we recap all of the rumors and information pertaining to the update so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>"Major New Features"</h2><br/>
In his newsletter this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">iOS 18 could be a "relatively groundbreaking" update</a> with "major new features and designs," although he did not share many specific details. Gurman added that Apple's senior management has internally described its upcoming operating systems as "ambitious and compelling."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smarter Siri</h2><br/>
Gurman said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">iOS 18 will feature generative AI technology</a> that "should improve how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences." He said Apple has explored new generative AI features for other apps across its platforms, including Apple Music, Pages, Keynote, and Xcode.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em> reported that Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">incorporate large language models into Siri</a> to let users automate complex tasks, a feature that would involve deeper integration with the Shortcuts app. The report said this feature is expected to be released in an iPhone software update coming next year, which could be iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>

Generative AI surged in popularity last year when OpenAI released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/22/chatgpt-app-voice-chat-free-to-all/">ChatGPT</a>, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts. Google and Microsoft released similar chatbots earlier this year, as more companies race into the space. The chatbots are trained on large language models, allowing them to respond like a human.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has publicly confirmed its interest in generative AI, and it has mentioned the technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/02/apple-seeking-generative-ai-engineers-for-ar-vr/">in job listings</a> posted on its website in recent months.<br/>
<br/>
"We've been working on generative AI for years and have done a lot of research," said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2023/09/29/apples-tim-cook-talks-about-ai-apps-vision-pro-and-iphone-gaming/">interview with <em>Forbes</em></a> in September. "And we're going to approach it really thoughtfully and think about it deeply, because we're fully aware of the not-good uses that it can have, and the issues around bias and hallucination and so forth."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Improved Texting With Android Users</h2><br/>
Earlier this month, Apple announced that it will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">finally support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later next year," so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on this timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
RCS support should result in several improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li><br/>
 <li>Improved encryption compared to SMS</li><br/>
</ul>These features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the built-in Messages app, providing for a much better iPhone/Android messaging experience compared to the current SMS standard.<br/>
