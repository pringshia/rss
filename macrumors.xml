		<description><![CDATA[Apple's standard AirPods now offer active noise cancellation for an additional &#36;50, bringing them closer in terms of features to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> than ever before, so which should you choose?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/AirPods-4-vs-Pro-2-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-968527" /><br/>
Almost three years after the launch of the first-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, Apple unveiled the second-generation model alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> lineup. Although the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; feature the same design as their predecessor, they improve on features like Active Noise Cancellation, in-ear detection, and battery life, while introducing new functionality like Adaptive Transparency, volume adjustment touch controls, and precision finding.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recently introduced a major update for its standard AirPods, with the earbuds gaining a more refined design for improved comfort, H2 chip, dust, sweat, and water resistance, 5GHz connectivity, a vent system for pressure equalization, Personalized Volume, Voice Isolation, a USB-C port, and "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>" command support – just like the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2. For an additional &#36;50, the similarities with the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; go even further with active noise cancellation, Transparency mode, Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, support for Apple Watch chargers, and a speaker in the case for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Should you consider purchasing one of the fourth-generation AirPods models, or do you need the higher-end &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, which sell for &#36;249? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these sets of AirPods is best for you.<br/>

<br/>
The standard AirPods are now very similar to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, offering almost all of the same key features at a lower price point. As a result, the fourth-generation AirPods should be the default choice for most prospective buyers. If you also have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, which already offer ANC, and are looking for an additional pair of headphones to use while working out or on the go, the fourth-generation AirPods are also a good choice.<br/>
<br/>
You should only buy the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; if you are happy with its in-ear fit, which provides better sound quality and active noise cancellation, but can be somewhat uncomfortable for prolonger periods of time. While the fourth-generation AirPods do now offer ANC, it is not as effective as that of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; due to the lack of an in-ear fit, so if noice cancellation is your main priority, the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 are still the best choice.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to better sound quality and ANC, the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 also offer slightly longer battery life, Conversation Boost, touch controls for volume, &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger compatibility, Precision Finding with the U1 chip, and a lanyard loop, as well as hearing protection, testing, and aid features via an upcoming software update. Many users will be able to justify the additional &#36;70 to get the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; as a result. Nevertheless, the fourth-generation AirPods are still a solid option for most average customers and will be better for those who do not like the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;'s in-ear silicone tips. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; frequently see hefty discounts on Amazon and other third-party retailers, so stepping up to the Pro version may be more worth it if you can take advantage of one of those deals. The standard AirPods also often see solid discounts, so it is always worth seeking the best price <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#airpods">using our Deals roundup</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4-vs-airpods-pro-2/">AirPods 4 vs. AirPods Pro 2 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 20 Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-4-vs-airpods-pro-2-buyers-guide-20-differences-compared.2439639/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's grip on the U.S. teen market remains strong, with new survey data showing high <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> ownership and increasing interest in Apple Intelligence, despite a slight dip in demand for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="2632" height="1480" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-965161" /><br/>
A <a href="https://www.pipersandler.com/teens">new report</a> from Piper Sandler's fall 2024 survey provides a comprehensive look at how Apple products continue to dominate among U.S. teenagers. According to the survey, which involved more than 13,500 teens across 47 states, 87% of respondents said they own an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Additionally, 88% of teens expect their next smartphone to be an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The data also highlights a marginal decrease in the number of teens planning to upgrade to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. About 22% of respondents said they intend to upgrade this fall or winter, which is a slight drop from the 23% who planned to upgrade to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> at the same time last year, and from the 24% for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> in 2022. The decrease suggests a growing trend of teens holding onto their iPhones for longer periods before upgrading, with the average &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; now being three generations behind the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. This is a notable shift from two years ago, when the average gap was only 2.5 generations. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the slight decline in immediate upgrade plans, a significant driver of future purchases appears to be Apple's forthcoming suite of AI features. Nearly 30% of surveyed teens indicated that they plan to upgrade their devices because of Apple Intelligence, which Apple plans to roll out starting later this year. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to iPhones, other Apple products remain popular among teens. AirPods continue to be a major hit, with about 70% of respondents reporting ownership of a pair. The report also noted that 25% of teens expect to purchase new AirPods in the next six months.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, ownership of other Apple devices including iPads and Apple Watches, is also strong, with more than 30% of teens saying they own each of these products. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ appears to have less traction, as only 10% of teens reported using the service, and they spend only about 1% of their total media consumption time on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, on the other hand, has maintained a steady presence among teens, with approximately one-third of respondents saying they have access to the service. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/piper-jaffray/">Piper Jaffray</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/iphone-16-demand-dips-among-teens/">iPhone 16 Demand Dips Among Teens, But Interest in Apple Intelligence Could Still Spur Upgrades</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-demand-dips-among-teens-but-interest-in-apple-intelligence-could-still-spur-upgrades.2439631/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple released the HomePod mini nearly four years ago, so you may be wondering when the speaker will receive hardware upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/homepod-mini-thumb-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770560" /><br/>
Below, we recap rumors about a next-generation HomePod mini.<br/>
<br/>
The firmest rumor came from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who in February 2023 said mass shipments of a second-generation HomePod mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/homepod-mini-2-shipping-next-year/">would begin in the second half of 2024</a>. However, it is unclear if that info is still accurate, as there have not been any recent HomePod mini rumors from credible sources.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo did not reveal any new features planned for the next HomePod mini, but plausible upgrades could include a newer S-series chip for more advanced computational audio, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for a lower-latency Handoff experience, and new color options. The current HomePod mini is equipped with an S5 chip and a U1 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already refreshed the color options for the HomePod mini a few times. The speaker was released in Blue, Orange, and Yellow in November 2021, and Space Gray was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/homepod-mini-midnight-color/">replaced with a virtually-identical Midnight finish</a> in July.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the lack of recent rumors, the likelihood of a new HomePod mini being imminent seems low. However, a new HomePod mini could end up being a surprise announcement at Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/new-ipad-mini-rumored-for-october/">rumored October event</a>, or it could be introduced in a press release on the Apple Newsroom website at any point over the coming months.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has the Apple Studio Display for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,294.99</strong></a> during Prime Day, down from &#36;1,599.00, which is a new all-time low price on the monitor. This is the standard glass version of the Studio Display with the tilt adjustable stand, and Amazon also has a few other models on sale as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/studio-display-prime-day.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969568" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the standard glass model with the VESA Mount Adapter for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HGN6Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,294.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.00, while the tilt- and height-adjustable stand model is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HMZW5%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;1,699.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,999.00. In regards to the VESA model, this is another new all-time low price on the display.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;304 OFF</div>Standard Glass Apple Studio Display for &#36;1,294.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you want to upgrade to the nano-texture glass option, Amazon also has this model of the Studio Display on sale. It's available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HP4KL%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,594.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,899.00, which is a second-best price on the Studio Display with nano-texture glass.<br/>
<br/>
The Studio Display features a 27-inch 5K Retina display with a 5120 x 2880 resolution and up to 600 nits of brightness. Apple says that the standard display is engineered for "extremely low reflectivity," but for rooms where there is a lot of glare, Apple suggests the nano-texture glass option with even less reflectivity.<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m4-iPad-Pro-Horizontal-Feature-Purple-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950742" /><br/>
Released in May of this year, the 11-inch and 13-inch devices marked Apple's first use of OLED technology in larger screens and were initially projected to ship up to 10 million units in 2024. However, in its latest analysis, market research firm <a href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/blog/apples-oled-ipad-pro-volumes-continue-to-come-down-despite-having-the-tablet-markets-best-display-and-thinnest-form-factor">Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC)</a> has significantly lowered that forecast to just 6.7 million units.<br/>
<br/>
DSCC's Ross Young reports that shipments of the 11-inch model are likely to decrease by 40% in the third quarter and a further 30% in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter. The larger 13-inch model is said to be experiencing an even steeper decline, with shipments projected to drop by over 50% and 90% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Young attributed the lukewarm reception to several factors. The high price point, starting at &#36;999 for the 11.1-inch model and &#36;1,299 for the 13-inch version, may be deterring potential buyers who view tablets as complementary devices to smartphones or laptops. That's not to say that the new M4 processor and advanced display technology aren't impressive, but they may not provide enough incentive for consumers to upgrade their existing tablets. The limitations of Apple's iPadOS software could also be a factor. <br/>
<br/>
The situation raises questions about the viability of OLED technology in maintaining Apple's premium pricing for tablets. Young noted that in the TV market, OLED has successfully competed with mini-LED technology, but the price differential remains a significant hurdle in the tablet space. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is also said to be working on an OLED version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and prior rumors have suggested that it will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/2026-ipad-air-oled-panels-supplied-samsung/">released in 2026</a>. However, due to sluggish sales of OLED &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, Young expressed concern that the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;'s switch from LCD to OLED could be delayed by more than a year. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the disappointing sales figures for the OLED &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, Young remains optimistic about the future of OLED in Apple's MacBook lineup.  The analyst has previously predicted that the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will switch from mini-LED to OLED <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/macbook-pro-wont-switch-to-oled-in-2025-rumor/">as early as 2026</a>. Young said he still expects stronger demand for OLED laptops compared to tablets, pointing at the increasing adoption of OLED displays by PC manufacturers.<br/>
<br/>
MacBooks with OLED displays would offer increased brightness and improved contrast ratio compared to LCD models, and the displays would also be more power efficient for longer battery life. The switch to OLED displays could also contribute to future MacBook Pro models having a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/">thinner design</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/">Ross Young</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/m4-ipad-pro-oled-panel-sluggish-demand/">iPad Pro Shipment Projections Slashed on Sluggish OLED Panel Demand</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-shipment-projections-slashed-on-sluggish-oled-panel-demand.2439614/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Here&#039;s Why You Shouldn&#039;t Use iPhone Mirroring on a Corporate Mac</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new iPhone Mirroring feature in macOS Sequoia might seem like a convenient way to access your phone from your work computer, but security firm Sevco has uncovered a significant privacy risk that should make employees think twice before enabling this feature on company-owned Macs, at least for now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/macos-sequoia-macbook-air-iphone-mirroring-app-icon-in-dock.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969748" /><br/>
According to a <a href="https://www.sevcosecurity.com/iphone-mirroring-expose-employee-personal-information/">new blog post by Sevco</a>, the core issue lies in how iPhone Mirroring interacts with macOS's file system and metadata. When activated, the feature creates "app stubs" for iOS applications in a specific directory on the Mac:<br/>
<br/>
<strong><code>/Users/<user>/Library/Daemon Containers/<uuid>/Data/Library/Caches/<app_name></code></strong><br/>
<br/>
These app stubs contain metadata about the iOS apps, including icons, application names, dates, versions, and file descriptions. While they don't include the full executable code, they provide enough information for macOS to treat them as installed applications.<br/>
<br/>
The problem arises because many enterprise security and IT management tools routinely scan Macs for installed software. These tools often use macOS's built-in metadata system, which now includes these iOS app stubs. As a result, personal iPhone apps can inadvertently appear in corporate software inventories.<br/>
<br/>
Sevco demonstrated this issue using the macOS command line tool mdfind, which interfaces with the Spotlight search subsystem:<br/>
<code><br/>
<strong>mdfind "kMDItemContentTypeTree == com.apple.application" | grep Daemon</strong><br/>
</code><br/>
When executed in a Terminal window that has been granted full disk access without setting up iPhone Mirroring, the command returns a normal list of macOS applications. But when executed in that same Terminal window after setting up iPhone Mirroring, it also returns personal iOS applications and metadata. <br/>
<br/>
For employees, this means that apps they use privately could become visible to their employer's IT department without their knowledge or consent. This could potentially reveal sensitive personal information, such as dating apps, health-related apps, or VPNs used in countries with restricted internet access.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-iphone-mirroring.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956750" /><br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/how-to-use-iphone-mirroring-in-macos-sequoia/">How to Use iPhone Mirroring in macOS Sequoia</a></li></ul><br/>
Sevco has alerted Apple to this privacy concern, and the company is reportedly working on a fix. However, until a patch is released and widely implemented, the risks remain. For now, employees should avoid using iPhone Mirroring on work Macs. Companies should also be aware of this potential data liability and consider temporarily disabling the feature on corporate devices if possible.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macos-security/">macOS Security</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/do-not-use-iphone-mirroring-corporate-mac/">Here&#039;s Why You Shouldn&#039;t Use iPhone Mirroring on a Corporate Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-why-you-shouldnt-use-iphone-mirroring-on-a-corporate-mac.2439609/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a continuation of the latest unprecedented leak, Apple's yet-to-be-announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> has reportedly surfaced on <a href="https://www.avito.ru">Avito</a>, a popular Russian classified ads website. The development follows recent videos from Russian YouTube channels showcasing what appears to be the unreleased laptop model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/m4-macbook-pro-leak-russian-ad.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970162" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://x.com/aaplpro/status/1843589085237051515">reports on social media</a>, the listing on Avito advertised a 14-inch MacBook Pro featuring the next-generation M4 chip. The device was supposedly configured with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, and offered in a new Space Black finish – a color currently exclusive to the M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro models. The asking price was said to be around 720,000 rubles (approximately &#36;7,500), which is significantly higher than current MacBook Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, it appears that multiple units of the unreleased MacBook Pro were offered for sale, suggesting a batch was stolen from a Chinese warehouse and somehow made it into Russia. The listing reportedly included a note stating that the price changes daily and buyers should confirm before purchase. However, as of now, these listings have been removed from the platform, which prohibits the sale of "nonexistent" products.<br/>
<br/>
The latest leak comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eqPZ42NNTGI">unboxing videos</a> shared by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/">Russian YouTube channels</a> over the weekend. These videos purportedly show the upcoming MacBook Pro, revealing potential upgrades such as three Thunderbolt 4 ports for the base model (up from two previous-generation TB3 ports) and 16GB of RAM as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/">new minimum memory configuration</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While the authenticity of these leaks remains unconfirmed, they do line up with recent rumors about Apple's plans for its Mac lineup. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has suggested that Apple may introduce M4-powered Macs as soon as the end of October, with a potential release date of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/">November 1</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If genuine, this leak represents a significant breach in Apple's typically stringent security measures. The last time Apple faced a leak of this magnitude was in 2010 when an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 4 prototype was accidentally left at a bar in California.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not commented on these leaks, and it remains unclear how the company will respond to this apparent breach. As always, potential buyers should approach unofficial listings with caution, especially for unannounced products.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4/">M4</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/leaked-m4-macbook-pro-russian-classified-ad/">Leaked M4 MacBook Pro Appears for Sale on Russian Classifieds Site</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaked-m4-macbook-pro-appears-for-sale-on-russian-classifieds-site.2439604/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will soon release iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1, and these updates will bring the first Apple Intelligence features for compatible iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963424" /><br/>
Not all of the Apple Intelligence features that Apple has in the works are coming in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 updates, and there will be Apple Intelligence capabilities added in future iOS 18.2, iOS 18.3, and iOS 18.4 updates.<br/>
<br/>
We've rounded up everything Apple Intelligence-related that will be included in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 updates when the software comes out later this month.<br/>
<br/>
Note that Apple Intelligence is still being refined and perfected, and when it launches, it will launch in a beta capacity.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="writing_tools">Writing Tools</h2><br/>

<ul><br/>
 <li>Proofread text checks for spelling and grammar errors, including word choice and sentence structure. You can accept all suggestions with a tap or go through them one by one with explanations.</li><br/>
 <li>Rewrite cleans up what you've written and shifts the tone without impacting your content. Options include Friendly, Professional, and Concise.</li><br/>
 <li>You can select text and get a summary of it with Apple Intelligence. You can choose to create a paragraph, pull out key points, make a list, or create a table. Summaries are available in Mail, Messages, and more.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You can select any text on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac and use Apple Intelligence to access Writing Tools for summaries and other features.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="siri">Siri</h2><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960222" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>There's a new glow around the edges of the display when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is activated, applicable to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>. On Mac, the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; window can be placed anywhere. The glow animates responsively to the sound of your voice so you can tell when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is listening without interrupting other things you're doing.</li><br/>
 <li>A double tap at the bottom of the display brings up the Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interface so you can type requests instead of speaking them. On Mac, you need to press the Command key twice to bring up Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; includes suggested requests so you can get your questions answered faster.</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can maintain context between requests so you can ask a question and then reference it in a second reply. If you ask about the temperature in Raleigh, for example, and then follow up with "what's the humidity?" &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; should know you mean in Raleigh.</li><br/>
 <li>If you stumble over your words when speaking to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, or change what you're saying mid-sentence, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will follow along.</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has Apple's product knowledge and support base for answering questions about your device's features and settings, and can even find settings when you don't know the exact name by using natural language search.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="mail">Mail</h2><br/>

<ul><br/>
 <li>There is a summarize button for summarizing any of your incoming emails, plus you will see a brief summary of an email in your inbox list rather than the first few lines of the email.</li><br/>
 <li>Mail surfaces time sensitive messages first when applicable, putting them at the top of your inbox so you see what's important right away.</li><br/>
 <li>Smart Reply provides quick-tap responses to emails that you've been sent, with contextual options based on what's in the email.</li><br/>
 <li>Multiple notifications from Mail will be summarized on your Lock Screen so you can see what's in an email without opening the app.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messages">Messages</h2><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960223" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-messages-smart-reply.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Messages has Smart Reply options for incoming texts, which analyze the content of messages to offer suggestions of what you might want to say.</li><br/>
 <li>Multiple Messages notifications are summarized on your Lock Screen.</li><br/>
 <li>You can use all of the Writing Tools features in the Messages app for proofreading and refining what you're planning to send.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960208" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-memory-maker.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>You can create a Memory Movie with just a description, such as "My cat in 2024," or "Orlando in the summer." The feature automatically picks relevant photos and chooses songs, but you can tweak through the Memory Mixes feature or choose a mood to guide the direction of the audio. You can also add in specific scenes and images you want to see throughout the memory when you're creating the prompt.</li><br/>
 <li>Natural language search is available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, so you can just describe what you're looking for, such as "Eric rollerskating while wearing green."</li><br/>
 <li>Search can also find specific moments in video clips.</li><br/>
 <li>Search offers up smart complete suggestions for narrowing down what you might want to find.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3 id="clean_up">Clean Up</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app also includes "Clean Up," a feature that lets you remove unwanted objects from your photos. The Clean Up tool in the ‌&zwnj;Photos&zwnj;‌ app is able to automatically detect objects in an image that might not be wanted, but you can also tap, circle, or brush over an unwanted object to remove it.<br/>
<br/>
Zooming in on an image can help with using a finger as a brush to remove smaller blemishes and issues with an image, and it is intelligent enough not to remove part of a person even if a person or main subject is selected.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962933" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Photos-Clean-Up-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Clean Up works on all images in the ‌&zwnj;Photos&zwnj;‌ library, including older images and images captured by other devices like a point and shoot camera or a DSLR.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="transcription_summaries">Transcription Summaries</h2><br/>
In Notes and other apps, you can record audio and get a transcript along with a summary of your transcript, which is useful for recording lectures and other audio. Transcription isn't an Apple Intelligence feature, but summaries are. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="focus_modes">Focus Modes</h2><br/>
There is a dedicated Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode that only shows you important notifications that need attention while filtering out everything else.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960224" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-focus-mode-changes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
When customizing an existing Focus mode or creating a new one, there is a new toggle to turn on Intelligent Breakthrough and Silencing. This option allows important notifications to interrupt you, while muting notifications that are not important, which is the same thing that the Reduce Notifications Focus does. You can override the notification settings for specific apps and people, which is how it worked prior to iOS 18.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960225" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-focus-reduce-interruptions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="notification_summaries">Notification Summaries</h2><br/>
Your incoming notifications are summarized so you can see what's new for each app at a glance. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ios-18-apple-intelligence-notification-summary.jpg" alt="notifications" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968372" /><br/>
<h2 id="phone">Phone</h2><br/>
Summaries of transcriptions generated from your phone calls are supported in iOS 18.1. The iOS 18.1 update adds the option to record a phone call and get a transcription, which is not an Apple Intelligence feature. What does require Apple Intelligence, though, is getting a summary from that transcription without reading through the entire thing.<br/>
<br/>
Note that you can start a recording by tapping on the record button in the upper left corner of the display when on a phone call. All participants are notified that the call is being recorded before the recording starts.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" alt="" width="5416" height="3047" /><br/>
Recorded phone calls are stored in the Notes app, where you can tap in to view a transcript and get a summary generated from that transcript.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2><br/>
When reading an article in Reader Mode, there is an option to have Apple Intelligence summarize the article for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960226" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-safari-summarize.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="app_store">App Store</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> supports natural language and descriptive app tags to make it easier to find exactly what you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_report">Apple Intelligence Report</h2><br/>
In the Privacy and Security section of the Settings app you can access an Apple Intelligence Report that lets you export your Apple Intelligence data as part of Apple's promise for transparency around Apple Intelligence. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> is required to access and export Apple Intelligence data.<br/>
<br/>

When iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 are released, you will need to go to the Settings app and join the Apple Intelligence waitlist. Apple is using a waitlist mechanic to ensure that behind the scenes downloads go smoothly and that the system isn't overloaded.<br/>
<br/>
While on the waitlist, Apple devices download necessary files for on-device processing, and the waitlist should only take a few hours at most. The waitlist is on a per-account basis, so you only need to sign up for it on one device to have access on multiple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_compatibility">Apple Intelligence Compatibility</h2><br/>
The iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 betas are only available to registered developers with an eligible device. Devices that cannot run Apple Intelligence will not see the update.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>All <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max</li><br/>
 <li>All Apple silicon iPads</li><br/>
 <li>All Apple silicon Macs</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_availability">Apple Intelligence Availability</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence is only available in U.S. English at this time, and it is not available to developers in the European Union or China. Device region and language need to be set to the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_launch_date">Apple Intelligence Launch Date</h2><br/>
iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 are expected to be released on Monday, October 28.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_features_coming_later">Apple Intelligence Features Coming Later</h2><br/>
iOS 18.2, which we should get before the end of the year, is expected to bring support for ChatGPT integration with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, Image Playground, and Genmoji.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.3, coming sometime around January, could bring some new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features, but that's not yet guaranteed.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4 is expected to have the bulk of the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Apple Intelligence features including support for on-screen awareness for responding to what's on your display, better per-app controls and app integration, and personal context for more personalized responses to queries. We'll likely get iOS 18.4 around March.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will also be adding support for additional languages in 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/">Here Are All of the Apple Intelligence Features in iOS 18.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-of-the-apple-intelligence-features-in-ios-18-1.2439580/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to be slowly moving away from regular, timed hardware and software releases that come on an annual basis, instead favoring more of a staggered product release cycle, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> highlighted in his most recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-06/when-will-apple-intelligence-be-released-when-is-apple-releasing-m4-macs-ipad-m1xksx7q">Power On newsletter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m3-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950298" /><br/>
Gurman suggests that Apple Intelligence is evidence that Apple is "ever-so-slightly" moving away from a big fall launch for its hardware and software products. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> debuted without any Apple Intelligence features, despite the fact that Apple Intelligence was a key focal point of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; at the Worldwide Developers Conference, and heavily advertised for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, the first Apple Intelligence features will come out in October in an iOS 18.1 update, and Apple plans to add new Apple Intelligence capabilities in iOS 18.2, iOS 18.3, and iOS 18.4. Everything that Apple highlighted in June 2024 won't be available until well into 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has delayed some software features in the past, introducing them in later updates, but with Apple Intelligence, Apple announced everything well in advance and made it clear that the software updates would roll out over time.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman suggests that Apple could continue on this path, adopting a strategy that will see it release products when they're ready rather than pushing to get devices out on a scheduled timeline. As Apple's product lineup has grown more complex, software has also become more complicated. This year, Apple had to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/17/apple-pulls-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro/">pull iPadOS 18</a> for the new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models after it was released, plus it had to remove beta versions of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-pulls-third-software-update-in-past-month/">watchOS 11.1</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/apple-pulls-homepod-18-1-beta-2/">HomePod Software 18.1</a> because the software was causing significant issues.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is not expected to stop offering yearly releases of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but there are signs that it is holding updates on some other products. There was no new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> this year (and it seems to be on a 3-year update cycle as of now), nor did Apple introduce a new Apple Watch Ultra, instead adding a new color for the Ultra 2.<br/>
<br/>
Macs and iPads that are planned for 2025 will come at various points throughout the year and may not be tied to specific events like WWDC and the September &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; event. Gurman has previously said Apple will introduce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2025-macbook-air/">new MacBook Air models</a>, new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-4/">new iPhone SE</a> early in 2025, with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-studio-m4-mac-pro-2025/">to follow in mid-2025</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> to come later.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman suggests that continuing on with a staggered approach could result in more innovation thanks to fewer timing constraints, and that such a strategy would also make Apple less predictable, which is something that the company aims for.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/apple-release-schedule-changes/">Apple&#039;s Shift Toward More Staggered Releases Could Bring More Innovation and Less Predictability</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-shift-toward-more-staggered-releases-could-bring-more-innovation-and-less-predictability.2439574/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The current Apple TV was released two years ago this month, so you may be wondering when the next model will be released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" /><br/>
Below, we recap rumors about a next-generation Apple TV.<br/>
<br/>
In January 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">new Apple TV was planned for release in the first half of 2024</a>:<blockquote>Beyond the future smart displays and new speaker, Apple is working on revamping its TV box. A new version with the current design is in the works for the first half of next year with a faster processor, the people said.</blockquote>The first half of 2024 passed by without a new Apple TV, so that rumor has expired.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-06/apple-sept-9-event-preview-iphone-16-apple-intelligence-airpods-and-watches">Gurman said</a> "stable inventory" of the Apple TV suggested that a new model was not on the "immediate horizon" after all:<blockquote>While the company has been working on an update to the Apple TV set-top box for as early as this year, no new model has come to fruition and stable inventory of the device suggests a new version isn’t on the immediate horizon.</blockquote>All in all, there is no longer a clear timeframe for the next Apple TV. If you are considering purchasing an Apple TV, we recommend at least waiting until October is finished, just in case a new model is announced this month like in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Here is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li><br/>
<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li><br/>
<li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV:</strong> March 2012</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Whenever it comes out, the next Apple TV is rumored to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">could have a sub-&#36;100 starting price</a>. In the U.S., the current Apple TV is available with 64GB or 128GB of storage for &#36;129 and &#36;149, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The batteries inside the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus use an innovative type of adhesive that can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/18/iphone-16-and-16-plus-9v-battery-removal/">loosened with low-voltage electrical current</a>. Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-16-repair-manual/">official repair guide</a> recommends using a 9V battery with alligator clips for this process, but DIY repair website iFixit has released a new USB-powered tool as an alternative solution.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iFixit-VoltClip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970054" /><br/>
As reported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24262373/ifixit-iphone-16-battery-repair-adhesive">by <em>The Verge</em></a>, iFixit is now selling a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/voltclip">VoltClip tool</a> that is essentially a pair of alligator clips with an integrated USB-C adapter. With a USB-C to USB-C cable, which is not provided, you can connect the tool to any USB-C charger or device that supports 9V or 12V output. iFixit has a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Use+the+VoltClip+to+Debond+an+iPhone+Battery+Adhesive/177712">step-by-step guide</a> with complete instructions.<br/>
<br/>
The adhesive debonding process takes roughly 60 to 90 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
The tool is <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/voltclip">available for &#36;10.95</a> on iFixit's online store in the U.S., with same-day shipping available on orders placed before 1 p.m. Pacific Time each day.<br/>
<br/>
This electrical removal process does not extend to iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max batteries, which still have stretch-release adhesive pull tabs.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/ifixit-usb-tool-to-remove-iphone-16-battery/">iFixit Releases New USB-Powered Tool to Remove iPhone 16&#039;s Battery</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-releases-new-usb-powered-tool-to-remove-iphone-16s-battery.2439544/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+'s acclaimed sci-fi series "Severance" is set to receive a rare Blu-ray release this December, just ahead of the much-anticipated second season (via <a href="https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=35303"><em>Blu-ray.com</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/severance-apple-tv-plus.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-842248" /><br/>
Severance premiered on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ in February 2022. It was an immediate hit upon its debut, quickly gaining attention for its unique premise and dark tone. The show follows Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) and his colleagues at Lumon Industries, where employees undergo a procedure called "severance." This process separates their work and personal lives by splitting their memories in two, creating a stark division between their identities inside and outside of work. <br/>
<br/>
The release of the first season on Blu-ray on December 17, 2024 will allow fans and collectors to own a physical copy of the series for the first time. The launch marks one of the rare occasions where an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ show will be available outside the streaming platform and on physical media.<br/>
<br/>
While &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ offers a growing catalog of original content, physical media releases have been infrequent. Unlike some streaming platforms that have embraced physical distribution of their most successful series, Apple typically retains a tight hold on its streaming exclusives. In the case of Severance, the release is being handled by Fifth Season, one of the co-production companies involved in the making of the show. Apple itself is not directly responsible for the Blu-ray's distribution.<br/>
<br/>
Severance on Blu-ray is <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSeverance-Season-One-Blu-ray%2Fdp%2FB0DJC3GWYG%3Ftag%3Dbluray-011-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26m%3DATVPDKIKX0DER">available to pre-order</a> on Amazon now for &#36;42.98. It is worth noting that the release is only in Full HD (1080p), without the option of UHD (4K). Season two of Severance is set to be released exclusively on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ on January 17, 2025.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/">Apple TV Shows</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/severance-to-get-blu-ray/">Apple TV+&#039;s &#039;Severance&#039; to Get Rare Blu-Ray Release Ahead of Season 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-s-severance-to-get-rare-blu-ray-release-ahead-of-season-2.2439537/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the final iPod nano and iPod shuffle models to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">obsolete products list</a> worldwide, marking the end of an era.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/ipod_nano_2015_feature.jpg" alt="" width="1552" height="873" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757305" /><br/>
Apple introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/07/15/apple-launches-new-ipod-touch-nano-shuffle/">new color options</a> for the seventh-generation iPod nano and fourth-generation iPod shuffle in 2015, and those models are now obsolete in particular. Apple went on to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/27/apple-removes-ipod-nano-ipod-shuffle/">discontinue the iPod nano and iPod shuffle</a> entirely in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
Apple considers a device to be "obsolete" once seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Once a device is obsolete, it is no longer eligible for repair at an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider, with the only exception being MacBook battery replacements for up to a 10-year period.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also added the iPhone 6 to its obsolete products list today. Apple had already classified the larger iPhone 6 Plus as obsolete <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/apple-says-iphone-6-plus-is-now-obsolete/">in April</a>, but the smaller iPhone 6 had remained available through resellers in select countries for longer, so it only became obsolete now.<br/>
<br/>
Last, Apple added the 2017 model of the 12-inch MacBook and the sixth-generation iPad to its vintage products list today. Apple considers a device to be "vintage" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple might offer to repair a vintage product, but only if parts remain available.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/obsolete-ipods/">Apple Says Final iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle Models Are Now Obsolete</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-final-ipod-nano-and-ipod-shuffle-models-are-now-obsolete.2439535/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
