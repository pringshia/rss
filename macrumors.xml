		<description><![CDATA[OWC is hosting a <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-11911660?url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2F">big Mac accessory sale</a> that includes a number of discounts on Thunderbolt docks, USB-C hubs, external drives and enclosures, internal memory upgrade kits for Mac, and more. Most products are in stock and ready to ship out today, and OWC offers free shipping on orders &#36;149.00 and over.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/owc-docks.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940659" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with OWC. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Highlights of the sale include a collection of Thunderbolt docks for up to &#36;150 off. These docks allow you to easily connect a wide array of peripherals to your Mac, including two 4K displays or one 5K display with the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-11911660?url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2Fitem%2FOWC%2FTB3DK14PSG%2F">14-Port Thunderbolt 3 Dock</a>, which is available for &#36;129.99. This isn't quite as steep of a discount as we've previously seen on the accessory, but at &#36;150 off it's still a great second-best price for anyone who missed previous sales.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-11911660?url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2Fitem%2FOWC%2FTB3DK14PSG%2F"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;150 OFF</div>OWC 14-Port Thunderbolt 3 Dock for &#36;129.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
In regards to the 14-Port Thunderbolt 3 Dock, this accessory features two Thunderbolt 3 ports, five USB Type-A ports, one USB Type-C port, one Mini DisplayPort port, one gigabit Ethernet port, one S/PDIF digital audio output port, and one 3.5mm stereo audio input/output port. There are also two memory card slots for microSD and SD cards.<br/>
<br/>
All of the devices listed below are in new condition at OWC, although the retailer does provide various item condition options for anyone who might want to save money by purchasing open box items.

		<description><![CDATA[New iPads are coming, and Apple is holding a virtual event to introduce them! While it appears likely to be a relatively short video event, we should be seeing new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, some new accessories, and perhaps some additional surprises.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/top-stories-27apr2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948317" /><br/>
Other Apple news and rumors this week included word that Apple is FINALLY planning to introduce a native Calculator app for the iPad later this year, the release of a fresh round of betas for iOS 17.5 and related operating system updates, and perhaps the end of the road coming for Apple's FineWoven accessories, so read on below for details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces 'Let Loose' Event on May 7</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">announced that it will be holding its first event of the year on Tuesday, May 7,</a> at 7 a.m. Pacific Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time). During the event, Apple is expected to unveil <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/gurman-new-ipads-first-week-of-may/">new iPad Pro and iPad Air models</a>, along with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">updated Apple Pencil</a> and Magic Keyboard accessories. As always, there could be other surprises in store too.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Event-Let-Loose-Pastel-Blellow.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947822" /><br/>
The event invitation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">has a tagline of "Let Loose"</a> and includes an artistic render of an Apple Pencil. The event will be streamed on Apple.com and on YouTube, and we will have full coverage of everything announced.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Tim Cook Hints at New Apple Pencil</h2><br/>
Just moments after Apple announced its "Let Loose" event taking place on May 7, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-has-six-artistic-logos/">Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted at a new Apple Pencil</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/5.7.24-Logos-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2925" height="1646" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947814" /><br/>
"Pencil us in for May 7," said Cook, in a post shared on social media platform X.<br/>
<br/>
The next-generation Apple Pencil is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">rumored to feature a new "squeeze" gesture</a> for certain actions, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-pencil-visionon-support-in-testing/">may support Apple's Vision Pro headset starting with visionOS 2</a> later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Finally Plans to Release a Calculator App for iPad Later This Year</h2><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/calculator-app-for-ipad-rumor/">finally planning a Calculator app for the iPad</a>, over 14 years after launching the device, according to a source familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPad-And-Calculator-App-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947832" /><br/>
iPadOS 18 will include a built-in Calculator app for all iPad models that are compatible with the update, which should be widely released in September.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/macos-15-revamped-calculator-app/">revamped Calculator app for macOS 15</a> will likely be based on the iPad app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Seeds Third Beta of iOS 17.5 to Developers</h2><br/>
Apple this week made the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-seeds-ios-17-5-beta-3-to-developers/">third betas of iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5</a> available to developers and members of its public beta program for testing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943813" /><br/>
iOS 17.5 introduces the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/ios-17-5-app-web-downloads-eu/">ability to download select iPhone apps via the web in the EU</a>, adds a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-17-5-apple-news-quartiles-game/">new Quartiles game for Apple News+ subscribers</a> in select countries, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/new-ipad-and-apple-pencil-features-ipados-17-5/">hints at new iPad and Apple Pencil features</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>FineWoven Accessories May Get One Last Outing Before Apple Pulls Plug</h2><br/>
A leaker this week claimed that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-reportedly-stops-finewoven-production/">stopped production of FineWoven accessories</a> following poor reviews from customers, but they later said that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/finewoven-accessories-may-get-one-last-season/">may offer the accessories in one final set of new colors</a> before discontinuing them for good.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPhone-15-Pro-FineWoven-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947658" /><br/>
FineWoven is a fabric material that Apple introduced after it announced that it would no longer make leather accessories for the iPhone and other devices. Customers have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">complained about FineWoven accessories</a> being prone to scratches and stains.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Vision Pro Customer Interest Dying Down at Some Retail Stores</h2><br/>
Apple launched its Vision Pro headset in the U.S. in early February, but a recent report claims that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/">customer interest in the device has dramatically slowed</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
Apple said it will release the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/vision-pro-keyboard-new-languages/">in additional countries later this year</a>, and that will likely include the UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Japan, China, Singapore, and South Korea.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro starts at &#36;3,499, limiting customer demand for the device, but a less-expensive model will likely be released in the future.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[There are widespread reports of Apple users being locked out of their Apple ID overnight for no apparent reason, requiring a password reset before they can log in again.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-id-account.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948406" /><br/>
Users say the sudden inexplicable Apple ID sign-out is occurring across multiple devices. When they attempt to sign in again they are locked out of their account and asked to reset their password in order to regain access.<br/>
<br/>
This has led to additional Apple ID issues for users with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-stolen-device-protection/">Stolen Device Protection</a> enabled who are away from a trusted location, as well as any app-specific passwords previously set up in iCloud also being reset.<br/>
<br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/signed-out-of-apple-id-account-problem-password/">9to5Mac</a></em>, user reports about the problem <a href="https://www.threads.net/@nichagan/post/C6Pzb8jLrvx">began appearing on social media</a> at around 8 p.m. Eastern Time and became <a href="https://www.threads.net/@singletary/post/C6P9jfJt1VH">increasingly prevalent</a> into the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@ngorby/post/C6PvqnArUpZ">early hours</a> of the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ChrisLawley/112340853972099137">morning</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has been soliciting Vision Pro feedback since the device launched, but this week, the company has picked up on sending out surveys. We've had several reports from Vision Pro customers who have been asked to share their thoughts about the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-WWCD23-Vision-Pro-EyeSight-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922614" /><br/>
Apple asks about Vision Pro satisfaction, environment usage, favorite features, what it's being used for, how often it's used, and how long usage sessions last. Apple also asks about guest mode and who else uses the Vision Pro, which is a curious question because it's not at all set up for multi-person usage. Some of the questions:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Overall, how satisfied are you with your Vision Pro?</li><br/>
 	<li>What is your favorite feature or aspect of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> so far?</li><br/>
 	<li>How often do you use your &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;?</li><br/>
 	<li>For how long do you typically wear your &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; before you decide to take it off?</li><br/>
 	<li>Who else uses your Vision Pro?</li><br/>
 	<li>Before taking the survey, did you know that you can let others use your &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; with the Guest User feature?</li><br/>

</ul><br/>
The survey is long and in-depth, and also goes into the other devices that each respondent owns.<br/>
<br/>
The uptick in Vision Pro survey distribution comes as there have been reports about waning interest in the headset. Over the weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that customers aren't as curious about the Vision Pro, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/">demand for demos</a> in retail stores "way down." At some locations, demos and sales have dropped from a "couple of units a day to just a handful in a whole week."<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro headset owners have also reported a decrease in usage, picking it up just once or twice a week rather than on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said on Tuesday that Apple is dropping the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-cuts-vision-pro-shipments/">number of Apple Vision Pro units</a> that it plans to ship, and he said it is a sign that demand in the U.S. has "fallen sharply beyond expectations."<br/>
<br/>
Kuo believes that Apple needs to address the lack of key applications, price, and comfort without impacting user experience in order for the Vision Pro to ultimately see success in the future.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/26/apple-asks-customers-for-vision-pro-feedback/">Apple Asks Customers for Vision Pro Feedback</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-asks-customers-for-vision-pro-feedback.2424990/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is once again talking with OpenAI about using OpenAI technology to power artificial intelligence features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features">reports <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-18-WWDC-24-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944197" /><br/>
Apple held talks with OpenAI <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-iphone-ai-talks-google-openai-ongoing/">earlier in the year</a>, but nothing had come of the discussion. Apple and OpenAI are now said to be speaking about the terms of a possible agreement and how Apple might utilize OpenAI features.<br/>
<br/>
Along with OpenAI, Apple is still having discussions with Google about licensing Google's Gemini AI. Apple has not come to a final decision, and Gurman suggests that the company could partner with both Google and OpenAI or pick another provider entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">have a major focus on AI</a>, with Apple set to introduce AI functionality across the operating system. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/tim-cook-apple-generative-ai-break-new-ground/">confirmed in February</a> that Apple plans to "break new ground" in AI.<br/>
<br/>
We'll get a first look at the AI features that Apple has planned in just over a month, with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; set to debut at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">Worldwide Developers Conference</a> that kicks off on June 10.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/26/apple-open-ai-ios-18-talks/">Apple Reignites Talks With OpenAI About Generative AI for iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reignites-talks-with-openai-about-generative-ai-for-ios-18.2424987/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">"Let Loose" event</a> "will be accompanied by an event in London," according to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/apple-event-ipad-iphone-vision-pro-b2533340.html"><em>The Independent</em>'s Andrew Griffin</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/5.7.24-Let-Loose-Event-and-iPad-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948297" /><br/>
The report does not provide any additional details about what will be happening in London, but it might simply be a briefing that allows journalists in the UK to receive hands-on time with the new iPads and other products that Apple is expected to announce next month. Apple has frequently invited the media to hands-on briefings <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1782792088310206713">in New York City</a>, and it also held a briefing <a href="https://twitter.com/rsgnl/status/1765006539981484402">in Toronto, Canada</a> for the new MacBook Air models last month.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's "Let Loose" event begins on Tuesday, May 7 at 7 a.m. Pacific Time, which will be 3 p.m. local time in London. New devices and accessories expected to be announced at the event include two new iPad Pro models, two new iPad Air models, an updated Apple Pencil, and a redesigned Magic Keyboard for iPads, and there is always a chance of a surprise or two. A video stream of the event will be available <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">on Apple.com</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1J38FlDKxo">on YouTube</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has repeatedly said that he expects Apple to launch its Vision Pro headset in additional countries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/">before its developers conference WWDC</a>, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">begins June 10</a>. Could the accompanying "event" in London allow journalists in the UK to receive hands-on time with the Vision Pro too? It could make sense for Apple to launch the Vision Pro internationally before it announces visionOS 2 at WWDC, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/vision-pro-keyboard-new-languages/">UK is one of nine countries</a> where the headset is expected to become available next.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this is all just some pre-event speculation for fun based on a single sentence in a British newspaper. Apple's actual plans remain to be seen.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/26/apple-let-loose-event-london/">Apple Event Next Month Said to Be &#039;Accompanied By an Event in London&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-event-next-month-said-to-be-accompanied-by-an-event-in-london.2424983/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the rise of ChatGPT and large language models (LLMs), AI-dedicated devices have started coming out. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/humane-ai-pin/">Humane AI pin</a> was widely lambasted earlier this month when it launched, and now the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/ces-2024-rabbit-r1/">Rabbit r1 AI assistant</a> is out. With rumors that Apple is delving into AI in a big way, we thought we'd check out the Rabbit r1 to see what it can do and how it measures up to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqb3u5mXcl4?si=yWzYnRoO9p7Y3Exy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Priced at &#36;200, the Rabbit is a square-shaped pocket assistant that can answer questions, look up information, interface with food delivery and ride sharing services, play music, translate languages, and more. It's a cute little device that looks right at home <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/29/playdate-now-available-for-pre-order/">with the Playdate</a> from Panic, but most of what it can do can already be done with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the Humane AI Pin, the Rabbit r1 has a screen that you can interact with, which makes it much more functional. It comes with an old school scroll wheel for navigating the UI, and there's a built-in camera for recognizing objects. It is Wi-Fi only by default, but you can add a SIM card, which is an added cost.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/rabbit-r1-time.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948350" /><br/>
As a first-generation device, the r1 isn't perfect. The setup process is bare bones without tips on how to use the device or what it's able to do. You'll almost certainly need to visit the website to figure out how to use it if you pick one of these up, so it could do with some on-device instruction to make using it smoother. There are, for example, hidden controls like shaking the device to get to the settings, and the settings are the only way to activate the terminal for typing.<br/>
<br/>
The idea with the Rabbit r1 is to be less reliant on a smartphone, so there's no app for it. That's kind of a hassle if you want to get to the photos and other information that you've stored on it, because it's only accessible through the Rabbit Hole website.<br/>
<br/>
You can hook up services like Spotify, but it's not super smart about suggesting songs. Asking it to play liked songs, for example, resulted in random song selections. The option to translate works well, but it can be slow, and it's tough to get to.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/rabbit-r1-settings.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948351" /><br/>
In some tests, ordering food was successful, but not without hiccups. We didn't test placing an order ourselves, but YouTuber Quinn Nelson did and the AI placed the order but didn't ask for guidance on a tip and ended up being overly generous and tipping the highest suggested amount.<br/>
<br/>
The Rabbit r1 can summarize documents, a task that it's decent at, but that's not really something that a smartphone can't do. It is good at recognizing what's around through the camera, but some things, like a classic Mac, did trip it up.<br/>
<br/>
We need to spend more time testing the Rabbit r1, but so far, it seems like a neat device but also an unnecessary one that isn't quite ready to replace a smartphone. Have an opinion on the r1?

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/mr">Ocushield</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and one of <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/screen-protectors-mr">Ocushield's Blue Light Screen Protectors</a> to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ocushield-iphone-screen-protector.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948253" /><br/>
Ocushield has a range of medically rated screen protectors that are designed for for the <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/iphone-mr">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/ipad-mr">iPad</a>, and <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/macbook-mr">MacBook</a>. Ocushield specializes in blue light reduction, so all of its screen protectors cut down on the amount of blue light that you're exposed to when using your devices.<br/>
<br/>
Blue light can cause eye strain, headaches, dry eyes, fatigue, and blurry vision in some people, and it is hard to avoid between work on the computer and day-to-day <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> usage. Blue light can also impact sleep because it affects the production of melatonin and your body doesn't naturally produce enough to tell you when to go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ocushield-ipad-screen-protector-2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948254" /><br/>
Ocushield's <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/iphone-mr">iPhone Screen Protector</a> comes in sizes that fit all devices dating back to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5. It comes with a kit for cleaning the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and an applicator tray for alignment purposes, both of which make for a no-flaw application process.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/ipad-mr">iPad Screen Protector</a> features a similar kit, and it is available for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>. Each one comes with a screen cleaner, tray for application, sticker to remove dust, and a cleaning cloth.<br/>
<br/>
The blue light filters block up to 99 percent of UV and blue light emissions between 300-400nm, and up to 54 percent of harmful blue light between 400 to 470nm. Ocushield says that its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; screen protectors are meant to preserve the natural colors of the device for a clear picture.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ocushield-screen-protector-application.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948255" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Screen Protectors are both made of thin, tempered glass, which also offer screen protection. They come with an anti-bacterial coating, oil resistance, and an anti-reflection coating that cuts down on fingerprints. Ocushield says that the screen protectors are able to prevent eye strain, improve sleep, and protect the eyes and skin from harmful blue light.<br/>
<br/>
While the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Screen Protectors are permanent and attach with no-damage adhesive, Ocushield's <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/macbook-mr">MacBook Anti-Blue Light Filter</a> works a little differently. Apple does not recommend closing a MacBook with a screen protector attached, so the Blue Light Filter for Mac is removable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ocushield-mac-screen-protector.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948256" /><br/>
It adheres using silicone or magnets depending on your Mac model, and it can be put on when you're using your Mac and then taken off when you need to close the display. It offers the same blue light protection as the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Screen Protectors, but it also has a built-in privacy filter. When attached, the display of a Mac viewed from the side is near black, preserving privacy. It also has an anti-bacterial coating and an anti-glare coating that cut down on glare and reflections.<br/>
<br/>
Ocushield <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/eyejust-mr">recently acquired EyeJust</a>, a company that creates blue light blocking glasses, so it is expanding its product lineup with <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/glasses-mr">stylish glasses</a> that will work for all devices, and improving its presence in the United States (it is based in the UK).<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that Apple has added built-in blue light reduction features to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and Mac with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-shift/">Night Shift</a>, but the functionality only works at night. It also has a greater impact on color accuracy because it uses display color temperature for blocking blue light. Ocushield also has a wider feature set, including anti-drop protection for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and side-angle viewing restrictions on the Mac, plus glare reduction across all devices. To celebrate spring, Ocushield has a 15 percent discount on all products right now with the promo code BLOOM2024. <br/>

Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">event invite</a> shows an artistic render of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, suggesting that iPads will be a focus of the event. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-has-six-artistic-logos/">alluded to the Apple Pencil</a> in relation to the event and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-has-six-artistic-logos/">series of promotional Apple logos</a> appear to hint at upcoming illustration capabilities. Apple has not released any new iPads since October 2022, so this event has been a long time coming. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, along with updated &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and Magic Keyboard accessories. Here is everything that has been rumored:<ul><li>Two new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with the M3 chip, OLED displays, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">thinner enclosure</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-models-thinner-bezels-rumor/">slimmer bezels</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/">matte screen option</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, other design changes, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">possibly MagSafe wireless charging</a>.</li><br/>
<li>Two new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, including a first-ever 12.9-inch display option.</li><br/>
<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">aluminum top case</a>, larger trackpad, and other "laptop-like" design improvements.</li><br/>
<li>A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">new Apple Pencil</a>, which may have a new "squeeze" gesture for certain actions and eventual <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-pencil-visionon-support-in-testing/">support for visionOS</a>.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Apple's upcoming special event will take place on Tuesday, May 7 at 7 a.m. Pacific Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time), with a live stream to be available on Apple.com and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1J38FlDKxo">on YouTube</a> as usual. The event invitation does not mention an in-person component, with Apple inviting the media to watch online alongside the general public. It will take place just over a month before Apple's annual developers conference WWDC, which runs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">from June 10 through June 14</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple introduced the third-generation AirPods nearly three years ago and an all new model is now slated to launch later this year with a range of improvements and new features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/AirPods-Fourth-Generation-Feature-Red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905655" /><br/>
Many of the changes and improvements introduced with the third-generation AirPods originated on the first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>. As such, it seems likely that many of the upgrades coming to the fourth-generation AirPods will be shaped by the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. Our best indications so far about what to expect come from a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/airpods-4-new-design/">report by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="two_models">Two Models</h3><br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/airpods-4-new-design/">two versions</a> of the fourth-generation AirPods targeting different price points. The company is apparently aiming to replace both the third-generation AirPods and the lower-priced second-generation AirPods that it continues to sell. Currently, there is little difference between the AirPods 2 and ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>‌ beyond their designs.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end version of the AirPods will purportedly feature Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and a speaker in the charging case that can play a sound for easy location, which both have to date been limited to the ‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design_changes">Design Changes</h3><br/>
The next-generation AirPods are rumored to feature an updated design, looking like a cross between the current AirPods and the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, with slightly shorter stems. Fit is expected to be improved, but it is as of yet unclear if Apple will add silicone ear tips.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="h2_chip">H2 Chip</h3><br/>
One of the key aspects the next-generation AirPods are likely to bring over from the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; is the H2 chip. Both the second- and third-generation AirPods currently feature the H1 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-h2-chip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866128" /><br/>
Apple says the H2 chip provides an "exceptional acoustic experience" when paired with a new low-distortion audio driver and custom amplifier in the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. The ‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌ offer richer bass and clearer sound across a wider range of frequencies partly due to the computational audio improvements facilitated by the H2 chip, so similar enhancements seem highly likely to come to the fourth-generation AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
There could also be improvements to Personalized Spatial Audio, faster pairing and device switching, and persistent battery information thanks to the H2 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="bluetooth_5.3">Bluetooth 5.3</h3><br/>
In the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, the H2 chip is accompanied by Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. Many of Apple's products now feature Bluetooth 5.3, so the fourth-generation AirPods are highly likely to receive this upgrade. Bluetooth 5.3 offers faster and more reliable connectivity with Bluetooth accessories, as well as improved power efficiency, which can contribute to longer battery life. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="longer_battery_life">Longer Battery Life</h3><br/>
The H2 chip is more power efficient than the H1 chip in the second- and third-generation AirPods. In the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, the H2 chip and Bluetooth 5.3 provide an additional hour and a half of listening time with Active Noise Cancellation enabled compared to the previous generation. Applied to the standard AirPods, this could translate to a battery life increase from five hours to around six and a half hours.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="volume_controls">Volume Controls</h3><br/>
It is also possible that the AirPods could gain touch-based volume controls like the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. To turn the volume up or down, users simply place their thumb on the stem of either AirPod and use their index finger to swipe up or down on the small touch control area.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/Apple-AirPods-Pro-2nd-gen-Touch-control-220907.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866685" /><br/>
That being said, Apple could regard on-device volume controls as a high-end feature reserved for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, meaning that the fourth-generation AirPods could still miss out on this feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="find_my_improvements">Find My Improvements</h3><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> Charging Case is also likely to get several improvements to integrate more deeply with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>. The second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; introduced two key features in this area: The U1 chip for Precision Tracking and a built-in speaker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-precision-finding.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866313" /><br/>
Currently, your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> can help guide you to their location in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, but this is a limited experience on the current model, simply indicating whether or not they are nearby. The U1 chip would allow your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to show an arrow pointing in the specific direction of your AirPods, an approximate distance telling you how far away they are, and even a message saying if they are located on a different floor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/AirPods-Pro-2-Charging-Case.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-862696" /><br/>
Similarly, you can currently play a sound on your AirPods to help you find them, but this is played through the earbuds. If the earbuds are inside the charging case, it is likely the sound will be quite muffled. With the latest &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, Apple added a speaker to the charging case itself, allowing users to more clearly hear a location alert from their AirPods, and even locate the case when it is separate from the earbuds. An identical speaker is expected come to the high-end version of the standard AirPods in their next iteration.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that the lanyard loop on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; doubles as an antenna for the U1 chip, so this small feature could also be coming to the next-generation AirPods if they do offer Precision Tracking.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="apple_watch_charger_compatibility">Apple Watch Charger Compatibility</h3><br/>
The third-generation AirPods can charge via &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, a Qi wireless charger, or a Lightning cable. With its latest &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; model, Apple added the ability to use an Apple Watch charger as an additional charging method. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-apple-watch-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1564" height="878" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866129" /><br/>
Apple does not seem to regard charging technologies as "Pro"-exclusive features, so, as a basic utility, it seems likely that this added charging method will come to the fourth-generation AirPods to provide even more versatility. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="hearing_aid_functionality">Hearing Aid Functionality</h3><br/>
In a software update coming later next year, Apple will apparently add hearing aid functionality, allowing AirPods to serve as an over-the-counter (OTC) hearing alternative to traditional hearing aids. The FDA in 2022 approved <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/hearing-aids/otc-hearing-aids-what-you-should-know">OTC hearing aid options</a>, paving the way for Apple to market the AirPods for hearing loss. Apple also allegedly plans to offer hearing tests that would tell AirPods users if they are experiencing hearing loss.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="usb-c_port">USB-C Port</h3><br/>
Like the most recent &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models and the USB-C &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, the fourth-generation AirPods are expected to include a USB-C port for charging.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="release_date">Release Date</h3><br/>
Rumors suggest that the fourth-generation AirPods will launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">in September or October 2024</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4 Rumors: Everything We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-4-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far.2397674/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users know how to share a webpage link in Messages, but not everyone realizes that you can quote text from the webpage and include it in the message link. Keep reading to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/quoted-text-webpage-share-messages-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940595" /><br/>
Incorporating quoted text when sharing a webpage link in Messages is a great way to get to the point and make it clear why the content you're sharing is relevant and interesting. It not only makes the link more engaging but also personalizes the message if it's sent in the midst of a conversation.<br/>
<br/>
By highlighting specific text, you can streamline your communication by directing the recipient's attention to the most pertinent information on the linked website. It saves time, and ensures that the key piece of information you want to share isn't missed. It can also serve as a conversation starter. Here's how it works.<br/>
<ol><li>In Safari, navigate to the webpage containing the relevant information you want to share.</li><br/>
<li>Select the text that you want to quote in your shared link by pressing and holding on the words, using the selection anchors to more precisely include the text you want.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>Share</strong> button at the bottom of Safari's interface, then tap the Messages icon in the share sheet, or choose a contact to message in the suggested list above.</li><br/>
<li>In the Messages app, add a comment for more context if desired, then tap the send button.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Monday-11-Mar-2024-14-45-05.jpg" alt="" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940596" /><br/>
That's all there is to it. By using this method of sharing links, it can even serve as a memory aid in ongoing conversations, which can help both you and your recipient recall the relevance of its content to previous discussions.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple used to regularly increase the base memory of its Macs up until 2011, the same year Tim Cook was appointed CEO, charts posted on Mastodon by David Schaub show.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-feature-purple-green.jpg" alt="" width="2585" height="1454" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898568" /><br/>
Earlier this year, Schaub generated two charts: One showing the <a href="https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111813281624281698">base memory capacities of Apple's all-in-one Macs</a> from 1984 onwards, and a second depicting Apple's <a href="https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111382154184733138">consumer laptop base RAM</a> from 1999 onwards. Both charts were recently resurfaced by the <a href="https://atp.fm/560">Accidental Tech Podcast</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The graphs show that Apple tended to increase the base memory every two years or so, but that this trend ended when Cook took over the company from Steve Jobs. Memory increased quickly until the Mac Plus was launched in 1986, notes Schaub. "1986 to 1990 were all about decreasing the entry Mac price," he says. "Then we get a pretty straight logarithmic line until Tim Cook became CEO and there has only been a single increase since."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/all-in-one-base-ram-chart.jpg" alt="" width="1246" height="984" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948272" /><br/>
The correlation is interesting, but other variables such as market trends and changes in technology can help to account for the plateau in Cook's era. For example, Stuart McHattie <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@sdjmchattie/111813561857963100">notes</a> that early all-in-one Macs saw a tenfold increase every six years. If that trend had continued from 2006 onwards when the base was 500MB, modern base model Macs would have reached 500GB. Yet today's consumer PC demand for RAM remains around 8GB to 64GB, and very rarely exceeds double digits.<br/>
<br/>
Computers have also changed a lot over the last several years. RAM has gotten faster. Hard disk drives have been superseded by solid-state storage. Chips and components are more tightly integrated. Apple no longer relies on Intel processors to power its machines, and instead uses high performance system-on-a-chip (SOC) architecture, which fuses CPUs, GPUs, and unified memory into a single package. This is why the company feels confident in arguing that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">8GB on a Mac is comparable to 16GB on rival systems</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/laptop-base-ram-chart.jpg" alt="" width="1638" height="1208" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948273" /><br/>
But that does not change the fact that Apple has offered iMac and MacBook Pro models with 8GB of RAM since 2012. Likewise, the MacBook Air has had the same base memory configuration since 2017. In addition, Apple's adoption of unified memory means that Macs cannot have their RAM upgraded after purchase, while Apple continues to pursue a strategy of vastly overcharging customers for higher memory configurations. Users often pay out &#36;200 or more at checkout just to future proof their machines. <br/>

Apple's Mac memory configuration strategy is likely to become even more contentious if <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">all upcoming iPhone 16 models turn out to include 8GB of RAM</a>. (In the iPhone 15 series, only the Pro models have 8GB, whereas standard models have 6GB.) Why Apple is prepared to increase RAM in a smartphone but not in a multitasking Mac without users paying excessively for the privilege will be the overriding question on many consumers' lips.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/26/apple-mac-base-ram-boosts-ended-tim-cook/">Apple&#039;s Regular Mac Base RAM Boosts Ended When Tim Cook Took Over</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-regular-mac-base-ram-boosts-ended-when-tim-cook-took-over.2424950/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Sinks From First to Fifth Place in Chinese Smartphone Market</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Analytics company Canalys has released its <a href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q1-2024">latest report</a> on China's smartphone market for the first quarter of 2024, and Apple has come off worst among the top five brands jostling for supremacy in Asia's largest economy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-15-china.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943595" /><br/>
Huawei returned to the top spot after 13 quarters with a 17% market share. The local vendor shipped 11.7 million smartphones, thanks to its popular Mate and nova series, while OPPO rose to second place on strong performance of its Reno 11 series, shipping 10.9 million units. Conversely, HONOR, vivo, and Apple all slowed their sell-ins in the quarter, ranking third, fourth, and fifth, respectively. <br/>
<br/>
HONOR shipped 10.6 million units with a 16% share, a year-on-year increase of 9%, while vivo shipped 10.3 million units with a 15% share, a year-on-year decrease of 9%. Apple declined the most among the top five, sinking to fifth from first place, with 10 million units and a 15% share, which is a year-on-year decrease of 25%.<br/>
<br/>
Huawei's performance is up 70% from a year earlier, when the company was still reorganizing its phone business following U.S. sanctions. Huawei's 5G Mate 60 Pro uses a China-made 7-nanometer processor tailored for the local market, showcasing the kind of advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities that US sanctions were originally designed to prevent. <br/>
<br/>
Huawei has since released its new Pure line of flagship smartphones, and has been busy developing its own operating system, HarmonyOS, since it could not use Google's Android and Google Mobile Services. The continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem breaks the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China. <br/>
<br/>

The latest data is unlikely to make for pleasant reading for Apple's CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/tim-cook-visits-shanghai/">his trip to China</a> for the inauguration of a major new store in Shanghai. During his visit, coming on the back of a strong Chinese fourth quarter, Cook announced the expansion of Apple's R&D center in the city, highlighting China's crucial role in the company's strategy. Cook also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing, where he said the country was "critical" to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is deepening its ties with China despite expanding production in Southeast Asia and India. Approximately 17% of Apple's net sales from October to December were derived from the greater China region, making it the largest regional supplier in the company's supply chain. But Apple is facing an uphill battle to reverse falling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales there, with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/china-iphone-sales-slump-early-2024/">24% year-on-year decline in 2023</a> projected to deepen through 2024. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/huawei/">Huawei</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/canalys/">Canalys</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/26/apple-sinks-fifth-place-china-handset-market/">Apple Sinks From First to Fifth Place in Chinese Smartphone Market</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sinks-from-first-to-fifth-place-in-chinese-smartphone-market.2424942/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> in June 2023, adding an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Ultra chip and officially completing the transition away from Intel chips. The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; uses the same &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip that's in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, leading to criticism about its lack of power.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-Mac-Pro-Feature-Warm-2.jpg" alt="" width="2672" height="1503" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948229" /><br/>
Apple has now gone back to the drawing board and is working on an updated version of the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; that's set to come out next year. This guide highlights everything we know about Apple's &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; progress.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="m4_chip">M4 Chip</h2><br/>
The next &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will have a chip that's in the M4 family, as Apple is working to update its entire Mac lineup to the M4 series across 2024 and 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> believes that Apple wants to establish a more regular Apple silicon chip upgrade cycle that would perhaps see Mac chips refreshed on an annual basis much like chips designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says that the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will be equipped with the highest-end version of the M4 chip, which is codenamed "Hidra." Hidra is likely equivalent to an "Ultra" chip based on the way that Apple has differentiated its chips in the past. The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; is aimed at professional videographers, photographers, designers, and others who need significant processing power, and some pro users are said to have been unhappy with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, Apple is looking to make the M4 &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; more powerful.<br/>
<br/>
All of the M4 chips will be designed with a focus on artificial intelligence, with Apple aiming to highlight the AI processing capabilities of the chips and how they'll integrate into macOS. Apple is adding AI features that will run solely on device to the next operating system updates, so the M4 chips will need to have a lot of compute power.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that the M4 chips will feature an upgraded Neural Engine with more cores to handle AI tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="unified_memory">Unified Memory</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; could support up to 500GB Unified Memory, way up from the current 192GB maximum.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="will_there_be_an_m3_mac_pro">Will there be an M3 Mac Pro?</h3><br/>
It doesn't sound like Apple is going to bother with an M3 Ultra chip for the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;, with the company instead focusing effort on the M4 update.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design_updates">Design Updates</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; saw a major design update in 2019, with Apple doing away with the cylindrical "trash can" look in favor of a more reserved aluminum computer tower. There were no design changes to the 2022 model when it was refreshed, and so far we've heard nothing about design changes to the upcoming M4 variant.<br/>
<br/>
Launch is still more than a year away though, so it's possible Apple will make some design updates, at least internally to support M4 chip changes.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://satechi.net">Satechi</a> today announced the availability of its two new Qi2 charging stands, the 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand and the 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand. Qi2 is the latest version of the Qi standard, and it is comparable to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/satechi-3-in-1-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929700" /><br/>
Qi2 uses magnets to ensure that smartphones are aligned properly with charging coils, and it is able to charge compatible iPhones at up to 15W. The faster Qi2 charging speeds are available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, and all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models. Future iPhones, such as the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, will also work with Qi2.<br/>
<br/>
While Qi2 is basically the same as &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, it has the benefit of not being controlled by Apple, so Qi2 accessories can be a bit cheaper than &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; technology that manufacturers have to license from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-3-in-1-fold.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948211" /><br/>
Both of the Satechi Wireless Charging Stands have the same design, featuring a square wireless charging pedestal for the AirPods, an arm attached by a hinge, and a round magnetic wireless charger for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The 3-in-1 model adds a fold-out Apple Watch charger to the back of the arm.<br/>
<br/>
These chargers collapse down flat, which makes them convenient to tuck into a bag or backpack, but the aluminum they're made from is on the heavy side. The option to fold them down is a plus, but because of the weight, they may not be a better option than something like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/mophie-3-in-1-travel-charger-magsafe/">Mophie's 3-in-1 travel charger</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The folding design is, however, a major improvement over most chargers, so if you want something that works well both on a desktop and when traveling, Satechi's Qi2 options are worth looking at. Compared to a flat charger, being able to unfold the arm and have an upright charger is useful because it enables features like StandBy on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Night Stand mode on the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
The base of each charger has a soft-touch vegan leather material and a little divot where the AirPods are meant to go. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charging puck also has a soft-touch silicone to ensure that it doesn't scratch the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and the Apple Watch charger is made from a standard white plastic.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-3-in-1-design.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948212" /><br/>
With the aluminum build, the chargers look like quality products, and they'll match well with most desk setups. It is worth noting that Satechi is only selling these in space gray, so if you prefer silver aluminum or shades of white, that's not an option.<br/>
<br/>
The best part about Satechi's Charging Stands is the Qi2 charging puck. It's attached to the arm of the device using a hinge, so the charger can be set to several different angles. It can be positioned straight up so it's essentially a flat charging surface, or tilted down all the way to take up minimal space. In between, there are angles ideal for watching videos or FaceTiming. As with most upright magnetic chargers, the Charging Stands can be used with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; positioned in landscape or portrait orientation. Satechi says that the hinges on the stand won't weaken over time, and they do seem firm while still being easy to manipulate.<br/>
<br/>
In testing, Satechi's Qi2 Charging Stands worked like &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging stands. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is able to attach magnetically, and charging speeds were about the same as &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; did get a little warm a few times, but that also happens with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; chargers. Over a 30-minute period, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max was able to charge from 22 percent to 52 percent, for a 30 percent total charge.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-2-in-1-folded.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948216" /><br/>
The AirPods charging spot charges the AirPods at 5W, and the 3-in-1 version's Apple Watch charger is a fast charger so it can charge the Apple Watch Series 7 and later and the Ultra models at the quickest speed. There is a small light at the front of the charger when it is in use, but it is not overly bright.<br/>
<br/>
For powering the Charging Stands, there's a USB-C port at the back, which is nice because the cable can be swapped out if it becomes damaged or if you need a cable of a different length. The more expensive 3-in-1 charger includes a 45W power adapter and interchangeable plugs for international travel, and both models come with a plain black USB-C cable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-2-in-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948213" /><br/>
One of the benefits of Qi2 is lower prices, but Satechi's Wireless Charging Stands are still expensive. The 3-in-1 model is priced at &#36;130, likely because Satechi is still licensing Apple Watch charging technology from Apple, while the 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand is &#36;80. For the build quality and the versatility afforded by the hinged design, the pricing does not seem unfair, and Satechi's 3-in-1 is &#36;20 cheaper than MagSafe-based 3-in-1 charging options sold by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand is priced at &#36;130, while the 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand is priced at &#36;80. Both products can be <a href="https://satechi.net">purchased from the Satechi website</a> as of today.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest iPhones include several headline camera features that are worth using, such as Portrait Mode and Photographic Styles. But if all you want to use is the standard photo mode, there are still several tools and settings that can improve the composition of your pictures and help you capture the perfect shot using more traditional techniques.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Blue-Three-Quarters-Perspective-Camera-Closeup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909012" /><br/>
Whether you are the owner of a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or a longtime user looking to up your photography game, here are six camera tools and settings in iOS that are worth checking out and experimenting with.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="1._use_the_rule_of_thirds">1. Use the Rule of Thirds</h2><br/>
For a while now, Apple's Camera app has included a few optional settings that can help you line up your shots. Foremost in these settings is the Grid tool, which should be used when applying the rule of thirds. It divides the frame of your photo into a grid with two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, creating nine equal parts. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/grid-camera-tool.jpg" alt="" width="2716" height="1339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927774" /><br/>
The rule of thirds helps guide the viewer's eye to the most important parts of your photo and creates a more harmonious composition. Here's how to overlay a grid on the viewfinder.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap Camera. </li><br/>
<li>In the "Composition" section, toggle on the switch next to Grid.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/camera-grid-setting.jpg" alt="settings" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927655" /><br/>
<br/>
Here are five things to keep in mind when using the grid to apple the rule of thirds.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Identify the Key Elements</strong>: First, identify the main subjects or elements in the scene you want to photograph. These could be a person, a building, a tree, or any focal point.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Positioning the Subjects</strong>: Place these key elements along the lines or at the points where the lines intersect. For instance, if you're taking a photo of a person, you might position them along one of the vertical lines, rather than in the center of the frame.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Horizontal Elements</strong>: For horizontal elements like the horizon in a landscape, align them with one of the horizontal lines. For a more dramatic sky, place the horizon on the lower line. For more emphasis on the land or sea, place it on the upper line.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Balancing the Image</strong>: Use the rule of thirds to balance your photo. If you place a subject on the left, consider having something of lesser importance on the right to create a sense of balance.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Experimentation</strong>: While the rule of thirds is a guideline, it's not a strict rule. Feel free to experiment with it and see how shifting elements in your frame changes the photo's impact.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2._straighten_top-down_shots">2. Straighten Top-Down Shots</h2><br/>
If you're taking a picture of something from above like a plate of food or an ornament on the ground, consider using the camera level, as it helps you capture a balanced shot without having to use a tripod arm or mount. It's also useful for taking a shot of something directly above you, like an object on the ceiling or in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/level-camera-tool-setting.jpg" alt="" width="1338" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927776" /><br/>
The camera level tool used to be part of the Grid overlay, but Apple separated out the function in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, and it now has its own switch: Open the Settings app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, select Camera, then toggle on the switch next to Level. Now you are ready to use it.<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Open the Camera app, and set the capture mode to <strong>Photo</strong>, <strong>Portrait</strong>, <strong>Square</strong>, or <strong>Time Lapse</strong>, using the sliding menu above the shutter button.</li><br/>
<li>Point the camera straight down above your subject (or straight up if the subject/scene you want to capture is above you).</li><br/>
<li>Line up the floating crosshair with the fixed crosshair in the center of the screen by adjusting the angle of your phone's camera. The crosshairs will both glow yellow when in perfect alignment. </li><br/>
<li>Tap the shutter button to capture the shot.</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/camera-level-tool-in-action.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1058" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927779" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The aligned crosshairs turn yellow (right), indicating the lens is parallel with the ground.</em></div><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="3._straighten_your_horizontal_shots">3. Straighten Your Horizontal Shots</h2><br/>
By making the Level tool an individual option in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Apple has also included an additional horizontal level for more traditional straight-on photos.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-camera-level-no.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899126" /><br/>
Turning the Level option on makes a broken horizontal line appear on the screen when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; senses that you're lining up for a straight-on shot and you tilt your device slightly out of horizontal. The line appears white while your phone is out of level and then turns yellow once you achieve a level orientation to indicate success.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-camera-level.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899127" /><br/>
With the Level setting enabled (Settings ➝ Camera ➝ Level), try it for yourself. Open the Camera app and try shooting a subject at a straight angle, and you should see the broken horizontal lines in the center of the viewfinder. Straighten your angle up to connect the lines and make a single yellow line.<br/>
<br/>
The leveling pop-up only appears briefly and only within a narrow range of angles close to horizontal (in either portrait or landscape orientation), so it won't intrusively pop up when you're intentionally trying to take a photo at an angle.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="4._take_burst_photos">4. Take Burst Photos</h2><br/>
Burst Mode refers to when the camera on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; captures a series of photos in rapid succession, at a rate of ten frames per second. It's a great way to shoot an action scene or an unexpected event, since you're always more likely to end up with the picture you were aiming for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/burstmode.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="460" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-386450" /><br/>
To shoot in Burst Mode, go to Settings ➝ Camera and toggle on <strong>Use Volume Up for Burst</strong>, then simply long press on the Volume Up button when in the Camera app, and your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will take a series of photos in quick succession. Notice that a counter increases inside the on-screen shutter button for as long as you hold down the volume button. This indicates how many shots are being captured in the current burst. Simply take your finger off the volume when you want to end the burst of shots.<br/>
<br/>
When you take a series of burst photos, they automatically appear in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app under the Album name Bursts. You'll also find them in your main Photo Library. Follow the link to learn <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/delete-redundant-burst-mode-photos-iphone-ipad/">how to view and select the best of your Burst photos</a> in the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="5._mirror_your_selfies">5. Mirror Your Selfies</h2><br/>
When you take a selfie with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; using the Camera app, it automatically flips – or mirrors – the image so that it's an inverted version of the mirror image you see in the preview before you take the shot.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/stop-flipped-selfie-iphone-ipad.jpg" alt="selfie" width="2710" height="2616" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757877" /><br/>
This can look odd, since it makes a big difference to how selfies look. It can also be annoying, since most third-party social media apps automatically take mirrored selfies, which means you're more likely to be used to the mirroring functionality than the flipped selfies that your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ takes.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, you can change this default behavior of the Camera app, meaning that you can get the mirrored selfie you're probably more accustomed to seeing. Here's how.<br/>
<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app, then scroll down and select <strong>Camera</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle the switch next to <strong>Mirror Front Camera</strong> to the green ON position.</li></ol><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/mirror-front-camera-setting.jpg" alt="settings" width="1338" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927784" /><br/>
That's all there is to it. From now on when you use the Camera app to shoot a selfie, you'll capture the same shot that you saw in the app's preview mode.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="6._view_outside_the_frame">6. View Outside the Frame</h2><br/>
On &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 and later models, there is an optional camera setting that allows you to see what is outside the bounds of your photo's frame, so you can correct the alignment of photos (and videos) without having to resort to cropping.<br/>
<br/>

With the "View Outside the Frame" setting enabled, when shooting using the wide lens or the telephoto lens, the camera will simultaneously shoot using the next widest sensor. So the wide lens is active when you shoot with the telephoto lens, and the ultra-wide is active when you shoot with the wide. <br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap Camera.</li><br/>
<li>Under the "Composition" section, toggle on the switch next to View Outside the Frame.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/view-outside-frame-setting.jpg" alt="settings" width="1338" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927786" /><br/>
<br/>
You may have to play around with zoom levels to switch between lenses, but you'll know the feature is active when the camera interface turns semi-transparent to reveal the surroundings outside of the viewfinder.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photography/">Photography</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/camera-tips-every-iphone-user-should-know/">6 iPhone Camera Tips Every User Should Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/6-iphone-camera-tips-every-user-should-know.2424903/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://twitter.com/quinneverett/status/1783365286961332734">sent an email</a> to some iPhone Upgrade Program members to inform them that their previously-completed iPhone trade-in has been "canceled," but the email was almost certainly sent in error based on the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iPhone-Trade-In-Box.jpg" alt="" width="1472" height="828" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902097" /><br/>
Apple told customers it never received their iPhone, even though they sent it in months ago. In many cases, the customers physically handed their iPhones to an Apple Store employee in person, so there is no possible way they could be at fault. <br/>
<br/>
"Because you didn't trade in your iPhone, we are unable to complete the trade-in process," the email says, according to a screenshot shared with us by reader Quinn Everett. "The associated loan on this iPhone will resume."<br/>
<br/>
Everett and others said the Apple Store app also shows their iPhone's trade-in status has changed to "canceled," suggesting that Apple's email is legitimate. The email has been widely shared across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/weird-iphone-upgrade-program-email-questions.2424868/">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/1ccjcsk/your_tradein_has_been_canceled_the_associated/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/helloandrewc/status/1783352173675315592">X</a>, with many customers receiving it in the early hours of Thursday morning in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Many customers who received the email completed their iPhone trade-in last September, when the iPhone 15 series launched, so the delayed timing of the email suggests that it was sent as a result of a system glitch. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but we will update this story if we receive an explanation.<br/>

<strong>Update — 10:35 a.m. Pacific Time:</strong> We have confirmed that this email was sent erroneously and that customers who received it do not need to take any action.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update — 11:51 a.m. Pacific Time:</strong> Apple has now sent a follow-up email to affected customers that says to "please disregard the previous email we sent."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-trade-in/">Apple Trade-In</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/25/apple-email-says-iphone-trade-in-canceled/">Apple Mistakenly Tells Customers Their iPhone Trade-Ins Are &#039;Canceled&#039; [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-mistakenly-tells-customers-their-iphone-trade-ins-are-canceled-updated.2424897/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
