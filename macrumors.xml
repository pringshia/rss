		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first beta of an upcoming iOS 17.2 update, and it adds a whole slew of features. You can now access the Journal app that Apple has been working on, and share playlists with friends so they can add songs. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918854" /><br/>
iOS 17.2 is limited to developers right now, but it should soon be coming to public beta testers. We're expecting to see iOS 17.2 released to the public around November or December. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Journal App</h2><br/>
iOS 17.2 includes the Journal app that Apple announced as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. With the Journal app, users can record their daily activities and thoughts, with Apple providing optional prompts that can be used as inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Journal-App-iOS-17-Feature-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2612" height="1469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918878" /><br/>
A Journal entry can be added by tapping on the "+" button in the Journal app, and from there, users can choose a suggestion as the basis for their writing or just opt for "New Entry" to write anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
Entries are automatically tagged with a date for organizational purposes, but there are options for bookmarking, too. Journal entries can include images, voice recordings, and location tags.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Messages App Sticker Tapback Reactions</h2><br/>
You can now long press on any chat bubble in the Messages app to add a sticker response that serves as an alternative to a tapback reaction. Tapping on "Add Sticker" lets you choose either a sticker or an emoji to apply to the corner of an iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-tapback-reply-sticker.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918892" /><br/>
There was already an option to drag a sticker or an emoji onto any message bubble, but this is a much quicker method of quickly responding to an incoming message with a quick graphic that is more expressive than a tapback reaction.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Collaborative Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
There is now an option to create a playlist in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> that multiple people can add to. In a playlist you have made, tap on the three dot icon in top right of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="5484" height="3085" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918890" /><br/>
From there, select the Collaborate option and choose "Start Collaboration." You'll be able to create a link to the playlist, and anyone who has access to that link can add to it. You can also invite people to join via QR code, and if you want, you can approve each person that asks to join.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Favorites Apple Music Playlist</h2><br/>
Songs that you have favorited in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app are now aggregated into a Favorites playlist.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-favorite-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918891" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Music Listening History Focus Filter</h2><br/>
There is a Focus Filter for the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Listening History feature, so if you want to let someone else use your device to listen to music, you can activate this to turn off the Listening History so their song choices won't affect your recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-focus-filters.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918906" /><br/>
<h2>Action Button Translate</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max users can now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-translate-action-button/">choose a new Translate option</a> for the Action Button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-translate.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918874" /><br/>
When the Action Button is set as Translate, pressing to hold causes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to pop up a Translate window that listens for spoken text. It is able to translate from one set language to another, using the languages that you have previously set up in the Translate app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iMessage Contact Key Verification</h2><br/>
First previewed in December 2022, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-imessage-contact-key-verification/">iMessage Contact Key Verification</a> is a feature designed for those who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/Apple-advanced-security-iMessage-Contact-Key-Verification_screen-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876653" /><br/>
Users can ensure that there is no "man in the middle" snooping on iMessage conversations, and there is a Contact Verification Code so that iMessage users can verify that they're speaking to the correct individual during in-person meetings or on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Messages in iCloud Syncing</h2><br/>
The "Messages" section in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> in the Settings app has been renamed to "Messages in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;." It shows the total amount of storage that messages are taking up, the number of messages synced to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, and the time of the last sync. There's also a "Sync Now" option to force an update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-messages-in-icloud.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918896" /><br/>
Apple previously said that additional settings would be synced through Messages in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, like Text Message Forwarding, Send &amp; Receive accounts, and SMS filters across devices, so this may see those additional settings syncing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV App</h2><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">removed the separate tabs</a> for Movies and TV shows in the Store section of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has said that Apple also plans to remove the option to purchase TV shows and movies from the iTunes app as part of a TV app redesign, but that has not yet happened.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-tv-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918905" /><br/>
<h2>Emergency Alerts Local Awareness</h2><br/>
Under Notifications &gt; Emergency Alerts in the Settings app, there is a new "Local Awareness" option that can be turned on. Apple says that Local Awareness uses your approximate location to improve the timeliness, accuracy, and reliability of emergency alerts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-emergency-local-awareness.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918902" /><br/>
<h2>Weather Widgets</h2><br/>
There are new Details, Daily Forecast, and Sunrise/Sunset widgets. Detail shows information like precipitation chance, UV index, wind speed, and air quality, while Daily Forecast offers the weather for the next few days in a small widget size. Sunrise/Sunset shows the sunrise and sunset times for each day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/weather-app-widgets.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918889" /><br/>
<h2>Digital Clock Widget</h2><br/>
There is a new Digital Clock widget that can be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-clock-widget.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918894" /><br/>
<h2>Contact Posters</h2><br/>
You can now select a rainbow-colored text for your name when setting up a Contact Poster in the Contacts app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-contact-poster-rainbow.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918893" /><br/>
<h2>Books Page Turning Animation</h2><br/>
There's a new "Fast Fade" option for the page turning animation in the Books app. Apple has also removed the icon that you could turn on to scroll through content quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-page-turn-animation.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918897" /><br/>
<h2>AirPlay</h2><br/>
There's a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> Receiver" setting that will allow the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset to stream or share content to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-airplay-handoff.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918898" /><br/>
It also looks like the &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; feature for hotels that Apple announced earlier this year is live or will be live soon. It is designed to let you &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; content from your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to an AirPlay-equipped smart TV.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Memoji</h2><br/>
Apple added a "Body" section for Memoji where users can customize waist, bust, shoulders, and arms.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-memoji-body.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918895" /><br/>
<h2>News App</h2><br/>
The News app now supports Live Activities for following news-related events such as elections.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-apple-news-live-activities.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918899" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first iOS 17.2 beta, and it has the long-awaited Journal app that Apple initially announced as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. We've installed iOS 17.2 and thought we'd go hands-on with the Journal app to give <em>MacRumors</em> readers a first look at how it works.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/09sClt3NmuU" title="Apple&#39;s NEW Journal App - Full Walkthrough in iOS 17.2" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The Journal app has a simple, straightforward UI. When you open it up, you're presented with a "+" button, and tapping on it lets you start a new entry. When you first open the app, you can decide what information the Journal app can pull from your phone for writing prompts. Options include workout activity, media like podcasts and music, photos, and significant locations.<br/>
<br/>
There is a setting to prefer suggestions with others when you're around your contacts or large groups, and an option to be discoverable by others to help prioritize the suggestions of other people. Journal options can be toggled on and off in the Settings app under Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Journaling Suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
You can opt to write whatever you like, or choose from one of Apple's prompts that are based on your device usage. Prompts include invitations to reflect on your day, recall a new idea, think of what made you smile, think about what you could do to improve your life, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Journal entries can be customized with images, location information, and voice recordings. Entries are organized by date, and can also be bookmarked so you can save your favorite entries. To keep your Journal secure, you can set it up so you need a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> scan to unlock it. <br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in the tvOS 17.2 beta has updated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app, making it easier to navigate and find content to watch. There is a dedicated sidebar that houses content from different apps and streaming services, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-tv-app-redesign.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918880" /><br/>
The sidebar has dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj;, MLS Season Pass, Sports, the Store, and the Library.<br/>
<br/>
In a separate "Channels and Apps" area, users can access content from specific streaming services that integrate with the TV app. Options include ABC, CBS, Comedy Central, Hulu, ESPN, Discovery, Peacock, Prime Video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Tapping into a channel like Hulu shows content and watch suggestions just for that service.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-tv-app-hulu.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918881" /><br/>
Up Next in Watch Now has not changed, but Apple has added a new "My TV" section below the top charts that houses TV suggestions from multiple networks as a replacement for "My Channels." There isn't any dedicated Channels section in Watch Now, but a Channels and Apps feature has been added to the Store.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-tv-app-my-tv.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918882" /><br/>
Apple has also made tweaks to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. In the Store section, there are no longer separate tabs for Movies and TV Shows, with everything integrated together.<br/>
<br/>
The changes to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app come after a report from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> that said Apple would introduce a new design in December. Gurman's report said that Apple would remove standalone iTunes &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; apps that are available for renting and purchasing TV shows and movies, but that has not yet happened.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">Apple TV App Features Revamped Navigation in tvOS 17.2 Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-app-features-revamped-navigation-in-tvos-17-2-beta.2408783/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max users can select a new "Translate" option for the Action Button with the new iOS 17.2 beta. Apple promised that a Translate option was coming for the Action Button, but said that it would not be available right when the new iPhones launched in September.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-translate.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918874" /><br/>

<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In addition to the new Journal app, the iOS 17.2 and macOS 14.2 updates add support for iMessage Contact Key Verification, a feature that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/new-imessage-apple-id-security-features/">first previewed</a> in December of last year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/Apple-advanced-security-iMessage-Contact-Key-Verification_screen-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876653" /><br/>
Designed for those who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials, iMessage Contact Key Verification allows people to verify the identify of the person they're corresponding with. It is available today in the iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.2, and watchOS 10.2 betas. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac users who have iMessage Contact Key Verification enabled will be notified if a malicious entity somehow succeeds in breaching cloud data servers and is able to eavesdrop on a conversation.<br/>
<br/>
The feature also includes a Contact Verification Code that can be used in person or on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>.<br/>
<blockquote>With iMessage Contact Key Verification, users can choose to further verify that they are messaging only with the people they intend. Contact Key Verification uses Key Transparency to enable automatic verification that the iMessage key distribution service returns device keys that have been logged to a verifiable and auditable map. When a user enables Contact Key Verification, they will be notified about any validation errors directly in the Messages conversation transcript and Apple ID Settings.<br/>
<br/>
For even higher security, iMessage contact key verification users can compare a Contact Verification Code in person, on FaceTime, or through another secure call. They can also choose to create or edit a contact and save a public key to turn on CKV with that person.</blockquote><br/>
To use iMessage Contact Key Verification, all devices signed into an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> account must have the iOS 17.2 beta, macOS 17.2 beta, and/or watchOS 10.2 beta.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-imessage-contact-key-verification/">iMessage Contact Key Verification Added in iOS 17.2 and macOS Sonoma 14.2 Betas</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/imessage-contact-key-verification-added-in-ios-17-2-and-macos-sonoma-14-2-betas.2408775/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.2 beta that Apple seeded to developers today includes the first iteration of the Journal app that Apple announced way back in June when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> was initially previewed. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Journal-App-iOS-17.jpeg" alt="" width="2612" height="1828" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898865" /><br/>
Apple's Journal app will let <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users record their daily thoughts and activities. It incorporates data like photos, music listened to, workouts, and more, plus it suggests topics to write about. <br/>
<br/>
Entries can have integrated photos, music, and audio recordings, and important moments can be highlighted. <br/>
<br/>
The Journal app is passcode and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> protected for privacy purposes, and all of the suggestions are done on-device. Entries are end-to-end encrypted. <br/>

Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta.

<br/>
There's no word yet on what's included in the iOS 17.2 beta yet, but we are waiting on the Journal app that Apple has said is coming in a later version of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;. We are also still waiting on the option to use stickers as a tapback reaction in Messages, an arrow for catching up on missed Messages conversations, and a favorite songs playlist in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>.<br/>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.2 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. There is no word yet on what's included in tvOS 17.2.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>

This sale is only available in the White color, and it's just &#36;0.99 away from being a match of the all-time low price on this HomePod.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-White-and-Midnight-Feature-Blue-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881771" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with B&H Photo.

Apple introduced the new HomePod back in January, and it features new temperature and humidity sensors, improved sound and microphone technology, and HomeKit and Matter support. Today's discount at B&H Photo is the just the second time we've seen a near all-time low price on the 2023 HomePod.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[There are currently no signs of an "Apple Watch Ultra 3" being in development within Apple's supply chain, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/apple%E5%9C%A82024%E5%B9%B4%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%E6%96%B0%E6%AC%BEapple-watch-ultra%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E6%80%A7%E6%AD%A3%E9%80%90%E6%BC%B8%E9%99%8D%E4%BD%8E-the-likelihood-of-apple-updating-the-new-apple-watch-680ba677e864">said today</a>. As a result, he believes the likelihood of a new Apple Watch Ultra being released in 2024 is "decreasing."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-hero-feature-white.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911671" /><br/>
"If Apple doesn't officially kick off the Apple Watch Ultra 3 project by December, it's almost confirmed that we won't see a new Apple Watch Ultra in 2024," said Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
If the Apple Watch Ultra is not updated next year, Kuo believes it is likely because Apple "needs more time to develop innovative health management features" and "address issues" related to micro-LED production. A new Apple Watch Ultra with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/cheaper-airpods-and-micro-led-apple-watch-rumors/">larger 2.1-inch micro-LED display</a> is rumored to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/microled-apple-watch-still-on-track-for-2025/">in 2025</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/04/apple-watch-ultra-microled-delayed-early-2026/">2026</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This prediction comes just over a month after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> was released. Key new features of the Ultra 2 include a 50% brighter display with up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, a faster S9 chip, a "Double Tap" gesture for interacting with the watch without touching the screen, on-device Siri, an increased 64GB of internal storage, and more. The original Apple Watch Ultra was released last year, so the models launched one year apart.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/kuo-apple-watch-ultra-3-in-2024-odds-decreasing/">Kuo: No Apple Watch Ultra 3 Next Year?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-no-apple-watch-ultra-3-next-year.2408730/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is actively developing new 12-inch and 13-inch MacBook models for sale at a planned price point of around &#36;700 or less, claims a rumor out of Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Low-Cost-MacBook-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2681" height="1509" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-918860" /><br/>
According to the operator of <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223247397138&navType=by">news aggregator account "yeux1122"</a> on the Naver blog, supply chain sources have "consistently" seen evidence that Apple has low-cost MacBooks in two different sizes in ongoing development. <br/>
<br/>
The account's sources suggest that while Apple has yet to fully commit to mass producing the low-cost Macs, they are now "more likely than ever" to make it to market because of a sharp fall in iPad and MacBook sales.<br/>
<br/>
The latest rumor comes after Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/kuo-apple-low-cost-macbook-launch-in-2024/">claimed</a> that Apple is considering launching a low-cost MacBook series next year to boost ailing MacBook shipments, with a target of 8-10+ million units per year.<br/>
<br/>
A <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/apple-low-cost-macbook-rival-chromebook/">DigiTimes</a></em> report last month also said Apple could launch a more affordable MacBook series in late 2024 to differentiate from the company's existing MacBook Air and Pro lines, and to help the company compete with Google's popular Chromebook models.<br/>
<br/>
The number of educational institutions that have adopted Chromebooks over the last few years has seen rapid growth, especially when compared to Apple's iPads, sales of which have declined in the education market. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's attention is said to be increasingly focused on the sector as a possible avenue to boosting flagging MacBook sales, and is considering offering cheaper and more compact student-friendly machines to claw back its market share. Higher-performance Chromebooks can be picked up for around &#36;700, hence the ~&#36;700 figure Apple is targeting, according to the latest rumor.<br/>

The Naver blog account has a mixed track record for forecasting Apple's plans, but some of its claims last year proved to be significant. For example, in March 2022 it accurately revealed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/iphone-se-rumor-magsafe-battery-life/">some details</a> about the third-generation iPhone SE ahead of Apple launching the model. In October of the same year it also accurately predicted that Apple would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/30/14-16-macbook-pro-next-year/">delay the release</a> of new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models until early 2023.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook.129">MacBook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-low-cost-12-inch-13-inch-macbook/">Apple to Sell Low-Cost 12-Inch and 13-inch MacBooks for &#36;700 or Less</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-sell-low-cost-12-inch-and-13-inch-macbooks-for-700-or-less.2408726/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today acknowledged a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/01/bmw-charging-may-break-iphone-15-nfc-chip/">BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 series, and promised that it will make a fix available later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/BMW-Logo-iPhone-15-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1489" height="744" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914891" /><br/>
In an internal memo shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers, Apple said charging an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max with a "small number" of wireless phone chargers built into certain recent BMW and Toyota Supra models may temporarily disable the NFC capabilities of the device. The memo does not provide a specific reason for the issue, which we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/01/bmw-charging-may-break-iphone-15-nfc-chip/">first reported earlier this month</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In an iPhone, the NFC chip powers features like Apple Pay and digital car keys. Users affected by this issue may receive a "Could Not Set Up Apple Pay" error message in the Wallet app, even if they have already set up Apple Pay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pay-Error.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="658" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914890" /><br/>
Apple said the issue will be addressed in a software update coming later this year. Given the memo was put out hours after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-ios-17-1/">iOS 17.1 was released</a> today, it appears the update will require a subsequent update, such as iOS 17.1.1 or iOS 17.2. In the meantime, Apple advises affected customers to stop using in-car wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
There are some complaints about this issue across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-apple-pay-issue-bmw-related.2404307/">MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DeeSoS3xy/status/1707882090107465845">X</a>, formerly known as Twitter, but it is unclear how widespread the problem is. Affected customers said the iPhone goes into a data recovery mode with a white screen, and the NFC chip is no longer functional after the device reboots. There is no way for customers to fix the problem, so a trip to an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider is required.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says technicians can attempt to restart the NFC chip in an affected iPhone by using a software tool part of Apple Service Toolkit 2. If this step does not resolve the issue, Apple advises technicians to initiate a hardware repair.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Tech reporter <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/author/jacob-krol">Jake Krol</a> today shared a brief hands-on video of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">the new Apple Pencil</a>, which features a USB-C charging port hidden under a sliding cap. The video, shared on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cy1_SQErcRk/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jakekrol/video/7294071432944880938">TikTok</a>, provides a first look at the sliding cap in action.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917176" /><br/>
Priced at &#36;79, the new Apple Pencil is a more affordable option compared to the first-generation and second-generation Apple Pencil models, which remain available for &#36;99 and &#36;129, respectively. It has a similar design as the second-generation Apple Pencil, but it charges with a USB-C cable instead of wirelessly.<br/>
<br/>
The new Apple Pencil will be available to order in "early November," but a specific release date has yet to be announced by Apple. It is compatible with all iPad models equipped with a USB-C port, including the lower-end tenth-generation iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is your first look at the new Apple Pencil, the &#36;79 one with a USB-C port.

Given its lower price, the new Apple Pencil lacks three key features compared to the second-generation model, including wireless charging, pressure sensitivity, and a double-tap gesture for switching between drawing tools. However, it does support the Apple Pencil hover feature with the latest 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/usb-c-apple-pencil-hands-on-video/">New Apple Pencil&#039;s Hidden USB-C Port Demonstrated in Hands-On Video</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-pencils-hidden-usb-c-port-demonstrated-in-hands-on-video.2408700/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released iOS 17.1, introducing a range of new features for iPhones that run the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> operating system. While Apple outlined some of the major new additions in its release notes, there are also several hidden features that were not mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H1vX2fyoiRg" title="iOS 17.1 - Everything New!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
In this guide, we've rounded up all of the feature additions and changes we found in iOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="airdrop_over_internet">AirDrop Over Internet</h2><br/>
AirDrop transfers can now be completed over a cellular connection or Wi-Fi if you walk out of the range of the person you're sharing with. That means you will not have to stay close to someone if you are transferring a large number of files.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914263" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ios-17-1-airdrop.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="1796" /><br/>
There is a new "Out of Range" toggle in the AirDrop section of the Settings menu that you can toggle to allow or disallow transfers over cellular.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_music_favorites">Apple Music Favorites</h2><br/>
You can favorite songs, albums, playlists, and artists in the iOS 17.1 Music app. Favorited music is added to the Library and improves recommendations. Favoriting replaces the prior "Love" system and favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen's Now Playing widget.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914260" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-music-favorite.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="822" /><br/>
A star next to a track in an album means that it's a favorite, while a dot is next to the most played track. With the favorites system, the Music app now suggests songs to add to playlists so you don't run out of content.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914261" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-music-song-suggestions.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="1229" /><br/>
Eventually, Apple plans to provide a Favorite Songs playlist and offer collaborative playlists, but these features do not appear to be implemented as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_music_playlists">Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 provides color-matched playlist artwork options that can be selected as a new customization option for your playlists. There are eight artwork styles that feature geometric shapes and gradients, with the colors featured pulled from the album artwork of the first song in the playlist.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914404" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17-Playlist-Artwork-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="double_tap_on_apple_watch">Double Tap on Apple Watch</h2><br/>
Double Tap is enabled in the watchOS 10.1 update that is also in beta testing, and the settings for it can be managed using the Apple Watch app.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915258" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/watchos-10-1-double-tap.jpg" alt="" width="2901" height="1632" /><br/>
<br/>
Double Tap allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> owners to tap their thumb and index fingers together to control the Apple Watch with one hand. The gesture can be used for opening up the Smart Stack, answering/ending calls, playing/pausing music, stopping alarms and timers, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="standby_display_options">StandBy Display Options</h2><br/>
Apple added a new "Display" section to the StandBy section of the Settings app, which houses some new customization options. The display can be set to turn off automatically, after 20 seconds, or never.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915259" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/standby-display-settings-ios-17-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
The existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/">Night Mode</a> function that adds a red tint and dims the screen has been relocated to this section, as has the Motion to Wake toggle. The Display section also replaces the prior Always On toggle that limited the display to turning off intelligently.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="action_button_update">Action Button Update</h2><br/>
In iOS 17.1, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/ios-17-1-action-button-tweak/">changed the functionality</a> of the Action Button to prevent certain actions from being triggered while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is in a pocket or a bag. The Camera, Flashlight, Voice Memo, Focus, and Magnifier functions will no longer activate when the Action Button is pressed if the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ is tucked away in a pocket.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911022" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-Button-Translate.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
Actions that make sense to trigger in a pocket like the mute function and a shortcut can still be activated while the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ is inside of a pocket by long pressing on the Action Button, but other features are disabled.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="uk_bank_balances_in_the_wallet_app">UK Bank Balances in the Wallet App</h2><br/>
UK users can <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2405112/post-32568420">add their UK bank accounts</a> to the Wallet app in iOS 17.1, allowing them to see their account balances, payments, purchases, and deposits.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914320" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/uk-bank-account-apple-wallet-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="wallet_app_and_discover_cards">Wallet App and Discover Cards</h2><br/>
U.S. Discover users who add their credit cards to Apple Wallet can see their total card balance and transaction history right on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with iOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="books_app">Books App</h2><br/>
The "Reading Now" section in the Apple Books app has been renamed to "Read Now."<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="dynamic_island_flashlight_indicator">Dynamic Island Flashlight Indicator</h2><br/>
When the flashlight is activated on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, or &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, there is now a flashlight icon in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> that lets you know that It is on. The flashlight icon for the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; was previously limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914275" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/dynamic-island-flashlight.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="561" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="controller_support">Controller Support</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1707161935358157268?s=20">includes support</a> for the Nintendo Switch N64 Controller.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="extend_wallpaper">Extend Wallpaper</h2><br/>
When you are setting up a new wallpaper, Apple has added an "Extend" option that can be used if the image does not fit the display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="photo_shuffle">Photo Shuffle</h2><br/>
When you add a Photo Shuffle Lock Screen in iOS 17.1, you can select a specific album of photos that will be shown on the Lock Screen rather than having to rely on Apple's pre-selected options like People, Pets, or Nature.<br/>
<br/>
When selecting any of the main Photo Shuffle images, you're brought into a customization screen where you can choose your Favorites album or opt for any other album you have created, giving you complete control over the images that show up on the Lock Screen. There was previously a tool for manually selecting photos, but being able to choose an entire album is quicker.<br/>

Photo Shuffle frequency remains the same at on tap, on lock, hourly, or daily.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="reachability">Reachability</h2><br/>
On iPhones with a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, you'll now see a black background when you use the Reachability feature. In prior versions of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, a blurred version of the device's wallpaper was shown. The change to a black background prevents the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; from being displayed twice when Reachability is used.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="home_key_support_for_matter_locks">Home Key Support for Matter Locks</h2><br/>
If you have a Matter-equipped lock that you've added to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, it can now be added to the Wallet app if it supports the Home Key feature.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="screen_time_syncing">Screen Time Syncing</h2><br/>
According to Apple, Screen Time settings now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/ios-17-1-improves-screen-time-syncing/">better sync across devices</a>. The change addresses complaints from parents who found that Screen Time settings would reset or not sync across devices, giving children more access to their devices than intended.<br/>

<h2 id="journal_app">Journal App</h2><br/>
There is no sign of the promised Journal app in iOS 17.1, but there are mentions of Journaling Suggestions in the code, which indicates that it could be coming before too long.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_for_the_ipad">New for the iPad</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> update adds support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">the USB-C Apple Pencil</a>.<br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="crash_detection_optimizations">Crash Detection Optimizations</h2><br/>
Apple in iOS 17.1 has further optimized the Crash Detection feature in the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models. Apple has tweaked Crash Detection several times to prevent it from activating accidentally at ski resorts and amusement parks.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="80_charging_limit_fix">80% Charging Limit Fix</h2><br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, Apple added a toggle that prevents the devices from charging past 80 percent in order to keep the battery healthy for a longer period of time. In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; could ignore this setting and charge past 80 percent, but that no longer happens following the second beta update.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="messages_bug_fix">Messages Bug Fix</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/ios-17-1-beta-2-seems-to-fix-messages-search-bug/">addresses an issue</a> with the search function in the Messages app in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;. Some &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; users have been able to search for older messages after transferring their data over from an older &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The Messages search feature only works for recent messages, but the update fixes the issue.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="display_image_persistance_fix">Display Image Persistance Fix</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 fixes an issue that "may cause display image persistence," a problem that has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/ios-17-1-display-image-retention-fix/">noticed on multiple iPhone models</a>, most notably the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. Several &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; owners complained that they had seen severe "screen burn-in" following the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s launch, but it turned out to be a software-based image retention issue.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="more_bug_fixes">More Bug Fixes</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Resolves an issue where the names of incoming callers may not appear when you are on another call</li><br/>
 <li>Addresses an issue where custom and purchased ringtones may not appear as options for your text tone</li><br/>
 <li>Fixes an issue that may cause the keyboard to be less responsive</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that its Shazam app has a new "Concerts" feature, which is designed to allow Shazam users to find concerts that are happening in their local area.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/shazam-concert-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918678" /><br/>
The Concerts section can be found in My Music, with recommendations based on each user's Shazam history. Apple says that Shazam users can browse, search, and filter by artist, date, and location, plus they can explore trending concerts.<br/>
<br/>
Events can be saved in the app with the option to set reminders about upcoming shows, view tickets, and unlock concert exclusives from select artists. These exclusives can include new watch faces and wallpapers, along with behind the scenes video, tour photos, and show set lists.<br/>
<br/>
Shazam's new Concert functionality follows new concert options that were added in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. Searching for an artist in Spotlight shows information about upcoming concerts with options for purchasing tickets and getting information on venue details.<br/>
<br/>
Shazam can be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shazam-music-discovery/id284993459">downloaded from the App Store</a> for free, and the song discovery features are also integrated directly into iOS.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shazam/">Shazam</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/shazam-app-concert-info/">Apple&#039;s Shazam App Now Includes Info on Local Concerts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-shazam-app-now-includes-info-on-local-concerts.2408689/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The watchOS 10.1 update that came out today fixes a bug that was causing Weather complications not to load properly on Apple Watch faces. First <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-weather-complication-issues/">reported in September</a>, the issue resulted in blank Weather complications even when the Weather app was working as intended.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913698" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/weather-complications.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
Apple in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213943">newly published support document</a> says that Apple Watch owners experiencing a problem with Weather complications should update their devices to watchOS 10.1 or later.<br/>
<br/>
If the Weather complications don't show up even after updating the Apple Watch to watchOS 10.1, Apple says that users will need to reset their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s Location settings. In the Settings app under Privacy > Security > Location Services, Apple says that users should scroll down to Weather, tap "Never" under Allow Location Access, then tap the original setting.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple confirms that watchOS 10.1 fixes the Apple Watch weather complication issue! <a href="https://t.co/3CAcT1W2tS">pic.twitter.com/3CAcT1W2tS</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1717285531757809688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Should that not work, Apple recommends that users go to General > "Transfer or Reset &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;," then tap on Reset > Reset Location &amp; Privacy to reset all privacy and location settings on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
After the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-0-2-weather-complication-fix/">watchOS 10.0.2 update</a> came out in September, there were reports from some Apple Watch users that the problem had been fixed, but it turned out that any fix was temporary and the Weather complication stopped working again.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/watchos-10-1-weather-complication-fix/">watchOS 10.1 Fixes Apple Watch Weather Complication Bug</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-fixes-apple-watch-weather-complication-bug.2408684/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Event Next Week Likely to Emphasize High-End Gaming on Mac</title>

		<category>October 2023 Apple Event</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[Apple yesterday announced that it will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">holding an online event on Monday, October 30</a> starting at 5 p.m. Pacific Time, and there are several reasons to believe that gaming on the Mac will be one of the major focuses of the event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-macOS-Sonoma-gaming-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898499" /><br/>
Below, we have recapped Apple's recent gaming-related efforts on the Mac and other clues heading into the event next week.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing</h2><br/>
Apple silicon chips often have architecture similarities. Like the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple's upcoming M3 series of chips for Macs will likely feature hardware-accelerated ray tracing for significantly improved graphics rendering compared to software-based ray tracing. M3 series chips are also expected to be manufactured with TSMC's 3nm process for faster performance and improved power efficiency compared to M2 series chips. These advancements pave the way for more AAA games to launch on the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Hints at More AAA Games on Mac</h2><br/>
Apple hinted at more AAA games launching on the Mac in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/16/devs-working-to-bring-console-games-to-ipad-mac/">recent interview with gaming publication <em>IGN</em></a>. When asked if the new games that Apple announced for the iPhone 15 Pro last month would eventually be compatible with Apple silicon Macs, Apple VP Tim Millet said "the developers are going to work with us to do it." These games include a Resident Evil 4 remake, Death Stranding Director's Cut, and Assassin's Creed Mirage.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Capcom and Sony Hints</h2><br/>
Japanese game developer Capcom recently announced that Resident Evil Village will be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and on iPad models with the M1 chip and newer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/resident-evil-village-iphone-15-pro-ipad-oct-30/">starting October 30</a>, which is the same day as Apple's event next week.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible that the release date lining up with the event is merely a coincidence, but it could hint at additional Mac-related gaming news to come from Apple and Capcom, and perhaps other game developers. A source informed us that Apple is holding its online event at the unusual time of 5 p.m. Pacific Time because it will fall during business hours in Japan, and claimed that the event will include a major tie-in with a Japanese game developer, but we have not independently confirmed the accuracy of this information.<br/>
<br/>
While the App Store says the Resident Evil 4 remake is set to launch on Macs with the M1 chip and newer on December 31, this date is a placeholder, and it is possible the release will be pushed up following Apple's event. The game was already released for Windows PCs, the PS4/PS5, and the Xbox Series X/S in March.<br/>
<br/>
As for Sony, it plans to launch cloud streaming for PS5 games in North America <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/10/11/ps5-cloud-streaming-launches-this-month-for-playstation-plus-premium-members/">on October 30</a>. Could there be a tie-in with Apple?<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Game Mode</h2><br/>
macOS Sonoma <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/macos-14-game-mode/">features a new Game Mode</a> that temporarily prioritizes CPU and GPU performance for gaming. Game Mode also lowers AirPods audio latency, and reduces input latency with popular third-party game controllers by doubling the Bluetooth sampling rate.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Game Porting Toolkit</h2><br/>
At WWDC 2023 in June, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/10/apple-releases-mac-game-porting-toolkit/">released a new toolkit</a> that makes it easier for game developers to port Windows games to the Mac. The toolkit provides an emulation environment that allows developers to run their existing, unmodified Windows game on the Mac and quickly evaluate how well the game could run on macOS before writing any code.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-event-mac-gaming-focus-likely/">Apple Event Next Week Likely to Emphasize High-End Gaming on Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-event-next-week-likely-to-emphasize-high-end-gaming-on-mac.2408680/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">today announced</a> significant price hikes for several of its services, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a>+. Because of the higher individual prices, the cost of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> bundles have also increased.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-TV-Arcade-and-News-Price-Increase-Feature-2-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1404" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918673" /><br/>
In the U.S., &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; is now &#36;9.99 per month, up from &#36;6.99 per month. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;+ is up &#36;2 at &#36;6.99, and &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ is now priced at &#36;12.99 per month, up from &#36;9.99 per month. &zwnj;Apple One&zwnj; Individual and Family are &#36;3 more expensive, while Premier is &#36;5 more. Prices are going up in most countries where Apple services are available.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-One-Services-Youd-Like-to-Keep-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918629" /><br/>
If you're unhappy with the new price points for Apple's services, it's quick and easy to cancel. Here's how on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Open up the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on your profile picture.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on Subscriptions.</li><br/>
 	<li>If you have &zwnj;Apple One&zwnj;, tap on "Cancel All Services" to end your subscription for every service. If you want to pick and choose certain ones to keep, tap on "Choose Individual Services."</li><br/>
 	<li>If you have individual subscriptions, tap on one of the subscriptions and choose the "Cancel Subscription" option.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on "Confirm" to go through with the cancelation.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
After your subscription is canceled, your services will continue to be accessible until your next billing date. So if you paid for a year of &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj;, for example, it will be available until what you've paid for expires. &zwnj;Apple One&zwnj; can only be purchased on a monthly basis, so you'll have a month at most before access runs out.<br/>
<br/>
If you need to cancel your subscription on your Mac, the process is similar. Open the System Settings app, click on your profile picture, select Media &amp; Purchases, and choose "Manage" under the Subscriptions option. From there, you can follow the same steps listed above.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's increased prices start today for new subscribers, but Apple is offering existing subscribers a 30-day grace period. After that 30 days, existing subscribers will see the new prices on their next renewal date. Apple is likely to send out emails ahead of the price hikes.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/cancel-apple-one-subscription/">Upset With Apple&#039;s Price Increases?
