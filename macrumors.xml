		<description><![CDATA[Following Apple's "Scary Fast" event on October 30, the new M3-based MacBook Pro and iMac models have officially launched, so media and everyday users alike have been sharing their thoughts on what's almost certainly the last of Apple's new hardware for 2023.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/top-stories-11nov2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922221" /><br/>
While hardware may be wrapping up for the year, Apple's still hard at work on software updates with a number of bug-fix releases this week plus a new round of betas for more significant updates we're expecting to see released before the end of the year. Black Friday deals are also starting to get underway several weeks ahead of the big day, so be sure to read on below for all of this week's top stories!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New MacBook Pro Reviews: Scary Fast, But M3 Pro Chip Has a Catch</h2><br/>
The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips began arriving to customers and launched in stores this week, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/m3-macbook-pro/">first reviews of the laptops have been shared</a>. We also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/m3-macbook-pro-hands-on/">shared our own hands-on video of the new MacBook Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-MacBook-Pro-Unboxing-Thumb-3.1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921534" /><br/>
The new iMac with the M3 chip is also now available, and we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/m3-imac/">rounded up reviews</a> of the all-in-one desktop computer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Says There Won't Be a 27-Inch iMac With Apple Silicon</h2><br/>
Apple discontinued both the Intel-based 27-inch iMac and iMac Pro over the past two years, and it has yet to launch a larger-screen iMac with an Apple silicon chip as a replacement, leaving the 24-inch iMac as its only all-in-one desktop computer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
Apple this week confirmed that it has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">no plans to release a new version of the 27-inch iMac with Apple silicon</a>, but that does not explicitly rule out the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">rumored 32-inch iMac Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases iOS 17.1.1 With Bug Fixes for BMW Wireless Charging and Weather Widget</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/">released a minor iOS 17.1.1 update for the iPhone with a pair of bug fixes</a>. Specifically, the update resolves a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/">BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup, and it addresses a bug related to the Weather widget displaying snow.<br/>
<br/>

The update is available for the iPhone XS and newer, and it can be installed in the Settings app by tapping on General â†’ Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases watchOS 10.1.1 With Fix for Apple Watch Battery Drain Bug</h2><br/>
Alongside iOS 17.1.1, Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-watchos-10-1-1/">released a minor watchOS 10.1.1 update for the Apple Watch</a>. The update resolves an issue causing excessive battery drain on a variety of Apple Watch models that had been updated to watchOS 10.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/watchOS-10-Launch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912513" /><br/>
Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/04/watchos-update-to-fix-battery-drain-issue/">acknowledged the battery drain issue in an internal memo</a> obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, and it has now delivered on its promise to make a fix available.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.2 Will Add These 10 New Features to Your iPhone</h2><br/>
iOS 17.2 remains in beta testing, and while we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/ios-17-2-features-list/">published an overview of ten features coming in the update</a> based on the first beta, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-beta-2-to-developers/">second beta released late this week</a> added even more.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Repair website iFixit today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yXCKMNEJUo">video teardown</a> of the new 14-inch MacBook Pro with both the M3 and M3 Pro chips, providing a closer look inside the laptops. The internal design is virtually unchanged compared to the previous MacBook Pro models.<br/>
<br/>

iFixit also <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/86128/how-apple-made-the-space-black-macbook-pro-darker-than-ever">shared a blog post</a> in which it explains how it believes Apple achieved its new, darker Space Black finish for the MacBook Pro. In short, it said that Apple managed to make the Space Black finish's anodized surface "more uneven" at a microscopic level, resulting in more light reflecting off it for a darker appearance.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple found they could etch the already rough anodized surface, making it more uneven," wrote iFixit's Kevin O'Reilly. "The resulting nooks and crannies further diffuse incoming light rays, sending them off in even more directions. Less white light makes its way to our eyeballsâ€”resulting in that slick matte finish."<br/>

		<title>Project Alaska: Apple&#039;s Second-Generation Vision Pro Headset</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the last several months, we've heard reports that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/vision-pro-2-focusing-on-size-weight-lenses/">working on a second-generation AR/VR headset</a>, although there have been few details shared about the device. <em>MacRumors</em> has now received new information about the project, giving us some insight into the design and hardware of the successor to the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898552" /><br/>
The second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, known internally under the codename Project Alaska and device identifier N109, bears striking resemblance to the first-generation Vision Pro announced at WWDC 2023. While the device maintains the curved aesthetic and button placement of the first Vision Pro, the speaker placement is expected to be different. <br/>
<br/>
Early designs of the second-generation Apple headset do not include the rounded areas that house the speakers on the first-generation model. Instead, the headset features temples that are flat and uniform throughout their entire length. Documentation related to the Alaska project contains references to a non-descript audio accessory, possibly an external speaker. At one point in development, there were two different design configurations for the top vents â€“ one being the same as the vents on the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;, and the latter featuring two clusters of tiny speaker-type holes.<br/>
<br/>
Another key difference has to do with the rear straps. The second-generation headset features straps that are simpler in design and appearance, being somewhat reminiscent of the flat straps commonly found on laptop bags or backpacks. Prior rumors have suggested that the next Apple headset could be cheaper than the Vision Pro, and the design of the rear straps on the second-generation headset lends some credence to this theory. More streamlined straps would presumably be easier to mass produce, perhaps resulting in a lower overall price for end consumers. <br/>
<br/>
Along with the possibility of an audio accessory, information from our sources suggests that Apple has plans for an external battery pack, similar to the battery pack used for the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of hardware, the second-generation Vision Pro will continue to include an array of cameras and sensors similar to those in the first headset. To be more specific, the device will feature a compass, ambient light sensor, magnetometer, and gyroscope, all of which are already present in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. For connectivity, the second generation Apple headset will support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5, and ultra-low latency audio (ULLA).<br/>
<br/>
Key hardware components of the second-generation Apple headset:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>2 micro-OLED displays</li><br/>
<li>1 TrueDepth camera</li><br/>
<li>4 computer vision (CV) cameras</li><br/>
<li>2 RGB cameras</li><br/>
<li>2 low light infrared illuminators</li><br/>
<li>Semi-automatic interpupillary distance (IPD) adjustment</li><br/>
<li>Compass, ambient light sensor, magnetometer, accelerometer, gyrocope</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Current information indicates that the second-generation Apple headset is scheduled for the product validation testing (PVT) stage of development in 2025, suggesting a release date of late 2025 or early 2026. The information we've shared comes from a reliable source that has provided us with details about Apple's plans in the past, but it is worth noting that this is pre-production information and Apple's plans could change before final mass production begins on the second-generation headset. <br/>

<br/>
Walmart kicked off its Black Friday sale with a major discount on AirPods 2, now available for &#36;69.00, down from &#36;129.00. Amazon briefly matched this price, but we haven't seen it return in two days. This is a new all-time low price on the 2019 earbuds, and a great Black Friday deal.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>HomePod</h2><br/>

Notable HomePod discounts have arrived for Black Friday, starting at &#36;78.99 for the HomePod mini at OWC in new condition but in bulk packaging and with a 90 day OWC fulfilled limited warranty. This is a solid record low price on the mini smart speaker.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 17.2, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/ios-17-2-public-beta-2/">currently in beta</a> and expected to be released in December, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-spatial-video-recording/">can record spatial video</a> with 3D depth for playback on Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset. When held in landscape orientation, the iPhone's main and ultra wide cameras combine to record 3D video.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Vision-Pro-Person.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913199" /><br/>
The feature can be toggled on in the Settings app under Camera â†’ Formats, and when it is, an extra button to record spatial video appears in the Video section of the Camera app. Spatial videos are recorded in 1080p at 30 fps, and Apple says the iPhone needs to be in landscape orientation and stabilized for the best results. Apple says the toggle will be turned on automatically for future Vision Pro owners.<br/>
<br/>
When played on the iPhone, spatial videos are regular 2D videos without any extra depth effect.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Vision-Pro-Spatial-Video.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922277" /><br/>
While the Vision Pro does not launch until "early 2024" in the U.S., Apple invited some members of the press to record their own spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro and watch them on the headset this week. Apple is still not allowing the press to share photos or videos of the Vision Pro, so there are only written impressions for now.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://techthings.cmail19.com/t/d-e-vhlukdk-irijhkzjj-r/"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern</a>, in her <a href="https://www.wsj.com/newsletters?sub=486&mod=article_inline"><em>Tech Things</em> newsletter</a>:<blockquote>At the demo, I recorded a sushi chef holding a piece of sushi. When I watched it back in the Vision Pro, the sushi and the chopsticks really looked 3-D. They were clearly in the foreground, hovering closer to me than the rest of the imagery. Of course the lighting was perfect when recordingâ€”we'll have to see how it does in imperfect conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple showed me some other spatial videos. In one, a dad was telling his young kids a story in the back of an RV. It was so lifelike and cozy that it almost creeped me out. Why am I spying on this random family? That's obviously the big appeal here: spatial videos create intimacy in ways 2-D photos and videos don't.</blockquote><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/deals/apple-vision-pro-spatial-video-first-look-iphone-15-pro"><em>TheStreet</em>'s Jacob Krol</a>:<blockquote>Likely as Apple intended, capturing Spatial Video is simple and feels just as intuitive as shooting in another one of the modes on the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max. You'll turn the phone into the landscape to unlock the recording mode, indicated by a headset icon, and see a level appear as you're filming.<br/>
<br/>
Horizon view and level are important, as an ultra-shaky video can be more jarring when playing back on the Vision Pro. In my experience, I captured a professional sushi chef creating a few standard rolls and rice balls, as well as the chef holding up the end product. I gradually approached, placing the roll while it was suspended in the air via chopsticks by about a foot and a half way. The iPhone did an excellent job of switching focus while I was moving around the piece of sushi and capturing the chef in the background. You can also manually click to focus if you'd like.</blockquote><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-iphone-spatial-video-arrives-in-beta-and-looks-amazing-on-vision-pro/"><em>CNET</em>'s Scott Stein</a>:<blockquote>The videos look great and the 3D is compellingly realistic. They're also easy to record, and can save as videos that will play back in 2D in a normal video format. But ultimately this feature is made for a 2024 product that, at &#36;3,500, it's safe to say most people won't buy anytime soon. Still, the experience is impressive.</blockquote>Stein noted that Apple's professional video editing app Final Cut Pro will be updated with spatial video editing support at some point next year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy is back with a few steep discounts on MacBook Air models today, including &#36;200 off the 13.6-inch MacBook Air and &#36;300 off the 15.3-inch MacBook Air. The best deals can be found if you're a <a href="https://howl.me/ckUf0uURy5j">My Best Buy Plus or My Best Buy Total</a> member, with everyone else able to buy these notebooks at solid second-best prices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/macbook-air-gingerbread.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922226" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
If you don't have a membership, you can <a href="https://howl.me/ckUf0uURy5j">sign up for one on Best Buy's website</a>. They start at &#36;49.99 per year for My Best Buy Plus, providing you access to exclusive sales and events, free two-day shipping, extended 60-day return window on most products, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>13.6-Inch M2 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Starting with the smaller model, Best Buy has the 256GB 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air at <a href="https://howl.me/ckYxabVFYOE"><strong>&#36;899.00</strong></a> for My Best Buy Plus/Total members, down from &#36;1,099.00. If you aren't a member, you can still get this notebook at a great price of &#36;949.00, which is &#36;150 off.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ckYxabVFYOE"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>13.6-inch MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;899.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Additionally, there's also the 512GB 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air at <a href="https://howl.me/ckYxehYyrkk"><strong>&#36;1,199.00</strong></a> for My Best Buy Plus/Total members, down from &#36;1,399.00. Non-members can get this notebook for &#36;1,249.00, which is another &#36;150 discount on the MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ckYxehYyrkk"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>13.6-inch MacBook Air (512GB) for &#36;1,199.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The My Best Buy Plus and Total member pricing represent the current best deals you can get on these MacBook Air models right now. For the 256GB notebook, this is also a match of the best price we've ever tracked.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>15.3-Inch M2 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Best Buy has the 256GB 15.3-inch M2 MacBook Air at <a href="https://howl.me/ckYxkzgComN"><strong>&#36;999.00</strong></a> for My Best Buy Plus/Total members, down from &#36;1,299.00, which is a new record low price at &#36;300 off. Non-members can get the computer for &#36;1,049.00, which is the typical sale price we track on this model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ckYxkzgComN"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;300 OFF</div>15.3-inch MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;999.00</div></a></div><br/>

If you don't have a membership, you can again get this one at &#36;250 off the regular price.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new MacBook Pro models are powered by cutting-edge M3 Apple silicon, but the base configuration 14-inch model starting at &#36;1,599 comes with just 8GB of working memory. In 2012, Apple launched the first MacBook Pro with Retina display, which also started with 8GB of RAM. Of course, Apple now uses integrated chips with unified memory architecture, which is why the company feels confident in arguing that 8GB on a Mac is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">comparable to 16GB on rival systems</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmWPd7uEYEY?si=zIgEy80AQutgE9Xj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
But not everyone is convinced. Apple's decision not to equip base models with at least 16GB of RAM in late 2023 has proved incongruous to many users, including Vadim Yuryev, co-host of the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmWPd7uEYEY">Max Tech</a>. Yuryev decided to perform several real-world tests on two 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro models, one with 8GB and the other upgraded to 16GB of unified memory. The embedded video above has all the results.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Yuryev saw significant performance improvements across the board using the 16GB machine under both middling and heavier workloads. The 8GB model suffered double-digit losses in Cinebench benchmarks, and took several minutes longer to complete photo-merging jobs in Photoshop as well as media exports in Final Cut and Adobe Lightroom Classic.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/max-tech-8gb-16gb-mbp2.jpg" alt="" width="2491" height="1400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922139" /><br/>
These tests were conducted as single operations with nothing else running, but also repeated with browser tabs, YouTube videos, spreadsheets, emails, and the like, open in the background to simulate typical real-world multi-tasking scenarios. As expected, the performance gap between the two machines widened further as the 8GB increasingly relied on its SSD swap file, while all-round responsiveness took a hit. Yuryev even reported crashes on the 8GB model during Blender rendering and a Final Cut export.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, Blender's raytracing acceleration was available as an option on the 16GB models, but was conspicuously absent on the 8GB MacBook Pro for an identical rendering job, suggesting the reduced memory pool actually prevents the GPU cores from utilizing certain features. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/max-tech-8gb-16gb-mbp1.jpg" alt="" width="2490" height="1401" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922142" /><br/>
Tests like these present a dilemma for customers looking to purchase a new MacBook Pro (or a new 8GB iMac, for that matter). Settling for 8GB appears to hinder the M3 chip's performance, but choosing 16GB or 24GB configuration options at checkout costs an extra &#36;200 and &#36;400, respectively, and Apple's machines cannot be upgraded at a later date because of their unified memory architecture. <br/>
<br/>
After factoring in the extra &#36;200 for 16GB on a 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro, an M3 Pro model with 18GB and several other extra features is only &#36;200 more at &#36;1,999. More galling perhaps is the fact that rival laptops at similar ballpark prices (Microsoft Surface or Lenovo Thinkpad, for example) come with at least 16GB of memory as standard. Apple customers are expected to pay &#36;200 extra each jump up, which surely includes a healthy markup, however much Apple pays its RAM suppliers.<br/>
<br/>
Is Apple's 8GB starting configuration for a &#36;1,599 MacBook Pro really acceptable in 2023? And has the company's memory pricing policy affected your own purchase options?

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models with OLED displays will be followed by sequential OLED MacBook Pro and OLED <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> launches over the next three years, according to analyst Jeff Pu from Haitong International Technology Research.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/Oled-iPads-and-MackBook-Pro-Notch.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-824300" /><br/>
In a new investor memo seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said Apple intends to update the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with OLED screens sometime in 2026, which tallies with the timeframe previously predicted by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/04/macbook-pro-not-getting-oled-until-2026/">Ross Young of research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Pu also reiterated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">widely rumored</a> next-generation 11-inch and 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models launching in 2024 that will also be equipped with OLED displays, with Apple aiming to ship 10 million units in the first year. <br/>
<br/>
There are currently no Macs or iPads with OLED displays. Compared to current &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and MacBook Pro models with LCD-based mini-LED screens, benefits of OLED technology would include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, improved power efficiency for longer battery life, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Pu also said that Apple is actively developing an OLED screen for the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, although the release of the OLED MacBook Pro is expected to come first. Previous reports have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/oled-macbook-air-now-in-development/">suggested</a> that Samsung Display is developing a 13.3-inch OLED panel for a future &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; model amid Apple's plans to switch several of its product lines to the display technology.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/">OLED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/ipad-pro-macbook-pro-macbook-air-oled-launches/">OLED iPad Pros, MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs to Launch in That Order</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oled-ipad-pros-macbook-pros-macbook-airs-to-launch-in-that-order.2410547/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in iOS 17.1 began allowing â€Œ<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>â€Œ users in the UK to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">view the account balances</a> of select bank cards and credit cards in the Wallet app, and now several more banks have added support for the feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/wallet-account-balance.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922103" /><br/>
Apple added the transaction and card balance functionality to the Wallet app in October as part of its Connected Cards feature, but initially only a handful of bank cards were compatible.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213903">updated support document</a>, account balance and full transaction history viewing now works with cards from Barclays, Barclaycard, First Direct, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds, M&S Bank, Monzo Bank, NatWest Bank, and Royal Bank of Scotland.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">How to View UK Bank Account Balance in Apple Wallet</a></li></ul><br/>
UK banks support the Open Banking API to integrate with the Wallet app, which made the feature widely available to UK users from the off, but the Connected Cards rollout in the United States has been slower.<br/>
<br/>
Following the release of the feature, <em>MacRumors</em> discovered that code in iOS 17.1 and references on Apple's website suggested that the feature would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/apple-wallet-connected-cards-feature-in-us/">expand to the US</a>, which turned out to be accurate. For example, users of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/apple-wallet-app-discover-card-balance/">Discover cards</a> were first to see the option to view their total card balance and transaction history in Apple Wallet. <br/>
<br/>
Note that if you don't see the option to Get Started below your card in the Wallet app, your card issuer currently isn't eligible. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/">Apple Wallet</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/more-uk-banks-show-account-balance-apple-wallet/">More UK Bank Cards Now Show Account Balance in Apple Wallet</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/more-uk-bank-cards-now-show-account-balance-in-apple-wallet.2410543/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922090" /><br/>
The Ai Pin attaches to a clothing item using a magnetic system that involves a detachable battery, which is also how the device is powered. The idea is to swap the battery out for a new battery when necessary, resulting in what Humane calls a "perpetual power system." It is not clear how long each battery lasts.<br/>
<br/>
Design wise, the Ai Pin looks something like an Apple Watch with a rounded rectangular shape, It is made from aluminum, comes in three colors, and has a Gorilla Glass touchpad. There's also an "optical sensing capsule," a 3D depth sensor, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip to power it.<br/>
<br/>
A laser projector inside the Ai Pin can project information onto the user's hand, and it is necessary because there is no standard display on the device itself. Humane calls the laser projector system a "Laser Ink Display." Interacting with the Laser Ink Display can be done by rolling and tilting the hand, and selecting an item is done with a finger tap similar to the tap used for Apple's own Double Tap feature on Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Touching the Ai Pin and speaking activates the "Ai Mic" that can answer questions and help users find information, including details they have previously relayed to the device, such as reminders. It plays music through a "Personic Speaker" that creates a bubble of sound around the wearer, plus there is an Interpreter feature. Humane says that the Ai Pin is "fluent in many languages" and can translate spoken words in real-time. There are no apps, with all actions and functions accessed through the AI.<br/>
<br/>
A built-in 13-megapixel ultra wide-angle camera can be used to capture photographs and videos, either using a two-finger double tap or a voice command. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> can be viewed using the "Center" website on any web browser. Center also houses notes that have been taken, music listened to, reminders, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922091" /><br/>
Users can tell the Ai Pin about their activity and nutrition goals to keep tabs on their progress and better understand the energy they take in and put out. Holding up a food item to the Ai Pin will allow the device to provide nutritional information and can let a user know if it's "safe" to eat based on their health goals.<br/>
<br/>
The device has cellular connectivity and can be used to answer phone calls from trusted contacts that are designated by the wearer. Humane says the Ai Pin is able to intelligently determine what takes priority if an untrusted contact calls or sends a message, allowing interactions such as a food delivery person arriving with an order. Calls and text messages can be sent using the Ai Pin, with messages composed through voice requests.<br/>
<br/>
The Ai Pin cannot be activated without direct user interaction, so it is not listening or recording by default. When the camera, phone, or microphone are activated, there is a colored "Trust Light" that lets other people around the user know when the Ai Pin is in use.<br/>
<br/>
Orders for the Ai Pin are <a href="https://hu.ma.ne/aipin">set to begin</a> in the United States on November 16. Ai Pin is priced at &#36;700, and there is also a &#36;24 monthly subscription required to use the device on the Humane network, which is powered by T-Mobile.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/humane-ai-pin/">Humane Debuts &#36;700 AI Pin With &#039;Laser Ink Display&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/humane-debuts-700-ai-pin-with-laser-ink-display.2410525/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is making some updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> with the iOS 17.2 software that is in beta testing, introducing a new focus on app categories.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/app-store-categories.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922085" /><br/>
In the "Apps" section of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, there is a new top navigation bar that allows users to scroll through various app categories, such as Entertainment, Education, Photo &amp; Video, Music, Navigation, and more. The categories mirror the categories that can be found at the bottom of the app section in the "Browse Categories" menu.<br/>
<br/>
The "Games" section also has a similar list of categories, such as puzzle, casual, racing, indie, simulation, casino, and adventure. These also mirror the categories at the bottom of the Games tab.<br/>
<br/>
Tapping into one of the categories listed in Apps or Games shows apps that are part of that category. Apple previously had these kind of top bar navigation options for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, but they have been expanded to the other &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; sections.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New in iOS 17.2: The AppStore now has a tab bar on top of the &quot;Apps&quot; and &quot;Games&quot; sections with different categories of apps. <br><br>Spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Johnthenormal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Johnthenormal</a> <a href="https://t.co/AuWqGYmCls">pic.twitter.com/AuWqGYmCls</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1722771032426070186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple is also mirroring the "Browse Categories" design first introduced in the &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; tab. Each category is now a card, with a detailed icon. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and earlier, categories were just text lists with a simpler icon design.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 is being beta tested right now and it is expected to see a public release sometime in December.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-beta-app-store/">App Store in iOS 17.2 Beta Features New Focus on Categories</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/app-store-in-ios-17-2-beta-features-new-focus-on-categories.2410515/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/">last in-depth report</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> 4, <em>MacRumors</em> has received additional information which further confirms the claims made in our previous article. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4, also known by the device identifier D59 and project codename Ghost, is a continuation of Appleâ€™s budget-oriented line of iPhones, and is expected to replace the current third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
With the arrival of the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, Apple plans to finally retire the aging <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 8-style design used for the previous two generations of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;. Instead, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will feature a more modern look and increased display size, closely resembling the base model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Newly obtained specifications indicate the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will use a modified version of the existing &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; chassis, with the same flat design. The dimensions of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 in its current stage perfectly match those of the base model &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;. Recent findings also confirm that the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will not include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> home button, instead featuring an all-screen design derived from the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> serving as the means of biometric identification.<br/>
<br/>
To better illustrate the size difference between the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 and the current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; third-generation, we have included the dimensions for the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; dimensions and weight:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Length: 146.7 mm</li><br/>
<li>Width: 71.5 mm</li><br/>
<li>Thickness: 7.80 mm</li><br/>
<li>Weight: 172 g</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3 dimensions and weight:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Length: 138.4 mm</li><br/>
<li>Width: 67.3 mm</li><br/>
<li>Thickness: 7.3 mm</li><br/>
<li>Weight: 144 g</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is expected to be lighter than the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; by about 6 grams, weighing 165 grams. The change in weight is likely a result of the single-camera design Apple has planned for the device. Unlike the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, developed under the codename "Portland", with a custom backplate for the device to account for the design change.<br/>
<br/>
The decision to use a single-camera design lines up with all previous models of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, with the flash located in a similar position as well. Itâ€™s worth emphasizing that there is significant evidence that backs up the single-camera design, with Appleâ€™s internal documentation highlighting it as a key change from the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from the single-camera design, no other significant factors could impact the weight of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4. No changes in materials are expected, with the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; using the same 6013 T6 aluminum found in the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, along with a glass backplate. Prototypes of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 have been seen in a black color closely resembling the Midnight color variant available for the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, suggesting that black will be one of the color options Apple plans to offer with the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Although the chassis dimensions of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 remain identical to that of the base model &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, the device will bring two significant features greatly differentiating it from previous &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models â€“ a multi-purpose Action button and a USB-C port.<br/>
<br/>
The Action button is a user-configurable button located above the volume buttons, first introduced with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, where it replaces the mute switch. Current information suggests that Apple intends to make the Action button a standard feature across the entire <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> range, with it eventually being available on the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 as well. The current development status of the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; suggests a potential release date of 2025.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple is experimenting with an all-new capacitive Capture button for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; range, there are no indications that this feature is being tested on the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4. The Capture button is expected to remain exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
It is important to remember that the information presented here is pre-production information and may not reflect the hardware found on final mass production units, as changes are always possible during development.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), which includes Apple as a member, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-connectivity-standards-alliance-announces-aliro-a-new-effort-to-make-mobile-devices--wearables-central-to-a-digital-access-future-301982416.html">today introduced Aliro</a>, a new standard that is aimed at improving the way that smart door locks work with smartphones and wearables.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/aliro-smart-home.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="861" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922075" /><br/>
Alliance members are working to develop a new communication protocol that will allow for interoperability between mobile devices, wearables, and access control readers. As with Matter, the idea is to have smart locks that are compatible with any smartphone or wearable device, without the need for an app.<br/>
<br/>
According to the CSA, the <a href="https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/aliro/">goal for the Aliro protocol</a> is to "foster widespread adoption of consumer electronic devices to unlock doors and openings" by creating a consistent experience across certified hardware devices.<br/>
<blockquote>"As we've seen with the introduction of Matter, it's been proven that global collaboration around a shared mission along open standards is the best way to achieve broader adoption of new technology," explains Connectivity Standards Alliance President and CEO Tobin Richardson. "The Alliance and its members are now using that same model to unlock the potential of digital access experience, with the creation of a new standard and credential that makes adoption easier for mobile device and access control reader companies."</blockquote><br/>
Aliro would be a common communication protocol and credential that would make it much simpler to get a digital key for a smart lock and unlock a door using a wearable or smartphone. The CSA says that it will have a "lasting impact" on the way that people access homes, corporate offices, warehouses, hotel rooms, healthcare facilities, universities, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Aliro will support a wide range of transmission technologies, including NFC, Bluetooth LE, and Ultra Wideband, along with asymmetric cryptography and credential data. It is meant to work the same way across devices regardless of hardware and operating system.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is an Aliro member, and it already has some of the groundwork for the functionality as it is described by the CSA. The CSA suggests that people will be able to use smartphones and wearables to unlock their homes in place of a physical key, something that Apple supports with Home Key already. Home Key allows a digital key to be added to the Wallet app to unlock a HomeKit-compatible door over NFC without opening an app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple, Google, Qualcomm, Samsung, and other CSA members support the Aliro effort.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aliro/">Aliro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/aliro-smart-lock-standard/">New &#039;Aliro&#039; Standard Aims to Simplify Unlocking Doors With Smartphones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-aliro-standard-aims-to-simplify-unlocking-doors-with-smartphones.2410507/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced a new firmware update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, including both the Lightning model and the new USB-C model. The new firmware is version 6B32, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/apple-releases-airpods-pro-2-firmware-update/">6A305 firmware</a> introduced in October.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new in the update, but prior software releases have been refining functionality introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; added several new features for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2, such as Adaptive Audio. Adaptive Audio, which combines ANC and Transparency, is meant to deliver an ideal audio experience that blocks out loud or distracting noises.<br/>
<br/>
Adaptive Audio includes Conversation Awareness and Personalized Volume. Conversation Awareness detects when someone speaks to you, lowering the volume of what's playing and cutting down on background noise so you can hear. Personalized Volume takes into account your listening preferences and the noise in the environment to adjust sound levels.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include an option to mute and unmute the microphone by pressing on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; stem, faster automatic switching between devices, and support for activating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> without including the "Hey" wake word.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the â€Œâ€ŒAirPodsâ€Œâ€Œ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the â€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€ŒAirPodsâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œ in the case, connecting the â€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€ŒAirPodsâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œ to a power source, and then pairing the â€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€ŒAirPodsâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your â€Œâ€Œâ€ŒAirPodsâ€Œâ€Œ or â€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œ&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;â€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your â€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œ&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;â€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap â€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€ŒAirPodsâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œ.</li><br/>

When turned on, the Sensitive Content Warning feature uses on-device machine learning to analyze photos and videos, and blurs photos or videos with any detected nudity before users view them.

		<description><![CDATA[The second beta of iOS 17.2 adds a new feature that allows an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max to record Spatial Video that can be viewed in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app on Apple's forthcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset.<br/>
<br/>

Spatial Video recording can be enabled by going to the Settings app, tapping into the Camera section, selecting Formats, and toggling on "Spatial Video for &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">iOS 17.2 Beta 2 enables Spatial Video recording <a href="https://t.co/mLMbI8aG6d">pic.twitter.com/mLMbI8aG6d</a></p>&mdash; iSoftware Updates (@iSWUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1722684032796733923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple says that for best results when recording Spatial Video, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> should be held stable in landscape orientation while capturing video. Video is recorded at 30 frames per second at 1080p, and one minute of video takes up 130MB of storage space.<br/>
<br/>
Spatial Videos taken with an &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; can be viewed on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as well, but the video appears to be a normal video and not a Spatial Video. Spatial Videos feature a "Spatial" label to denote that they can be viewed in 3D on the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
On the Vision Pro headset, Spatial Videos are not shown full screen by default. If you expand the video, Apple warns that the video "has excess motion" and "could cause discomfort if expanded."<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-spatial-video-recording/">iOS 17.2 Beta 2 Includes Feature for Recording Spatial Video on iPhone 15 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-beta-2-includes-feature-for-recording-spatial-video-on-iphone-15-pro.2410484/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.2 adds an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Favorites playlist that houses everything you've favorited, plus Apple added support for collaborative playlists. You can now share a playlist with multiple people, and each participant can add songs. <br/>
