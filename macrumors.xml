		<description><![CDATA[Two Maryland residents that tried to defraud Apple out of 5,000 iPhones worth millions of dollars <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/two-maryland-residents-found-guilty-multimillion-dollar-scheme-defraud-apple-inc-out">were today found guilty</a> of mail fraud. Chinese nationals Haotian Sun and Pengfei Xue masterminded a scheme to get Apple to exchange genuine iPhones for counterfeit iPhones sent in for repair.<br/>
<br/>

Between May 2017 and September 2019, Sun and Xue received shipments of inauthentic iPhones from Hong Kong, using spoofed serial numbers and/or IMEI numbers to return them to Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers. <br/>
<br/>
More than 5,000 total iPhones were submitted to Apple during that two year period. <br/>
<br/>
The two have been found guilty of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and are facing a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Sentencing will take place on June 21, 2024.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-store-repair-scheme-fraud/">Duo That Defrauded Apple Out of 5,000 iPhones With Repair Scheme Will Spend Up to 20 Years in Prison</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/duo-that-defrauded-apple-out-of-5-000-iphones-with-repair-scheme-will-spend-up-to-20-years-in-prison.2420014/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Supreme Court today said that it will not hear the VirnetX vs. Apple patent case, putting an end to a 14-year-long legal battle and ultimately saving Apple &#36;502.8 million.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/11/virnetx_apple.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="344" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-719205" /><br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/20/us-supreme-court-wont-review-apples-win-against-503-million-patent-verdict-.html">CNBC</a></em>, with the Supreme Court not weighing in, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/apple-virnetx-successful-patent-appeal/">March 2023 ruling</a> from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will stand, so Apple will not have to pay the damages that VirnetX won in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
VirnetX <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/30/apple-virnetx-503-million-patent-infringement/">won a successful jury trial</a> against Apple in 2020 and Apple was found to have violated VirnetX patents with its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> VPN on demand feature. The two patents cited in the case were later invalidated in a separate ruling from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.<br/>
<br/>
After Apple appealed the initial 2020 ruling, it was able to point to the invalidation of the patents and get the initial award vacated by the federal appeals court. VirnetX attempted to escalate the patent invalidation case to the Supreme Court, but has been denied.<br/>
<br/>
VirnetX is viewed as a patent holding company or "patent troll" that does not offer actual products or services. It generates revenue by suing technology companies that infringe on or license its patents.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple will not have to pay the &#36;503 million from this particular trial, Apple did have to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/15/virnetx-wins-440-million-from-apple/">shell out &#36;440 million</a> in 2019 for violating VirnetX's communications security patents with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> and iMessage.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/virnetx/">VirnetX</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/">Patent Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-wins-virnetx-503-million/">U.S. Supreme Court Refuses to Hear VirnetX Patent Case, Saving Apple &#36;503 Million</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-supreme-court-refuses-to-hear-virnetx-patent-case-saving-apple-503-million.2420013/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> series Masters of the Air had more viewers in its opening weekend than any other &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; show has had in its first season, Apple told <em><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/masters-of-the-air-premiere-ratings-apple-tv-plus-1235916408/">Variety</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/masters-of-the-air.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937279" /><br/>
Apple did not provide details on the exact number of viewers, but the show beat out popular &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; offerings like The Morning Show and Severance. Masters of the Air features the 100th Bomb Group that performed dangerous aviation raids in Nazi Germany.<br/>
<br/>
After the premiere of Masters of the Air, viewership across &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; grew 65 percent worldwide compared to the prior seven-day period, plus Apple maintained double-digit growth across more than 100 territories.<br/>
<br/>
Masters of the Air was a highly anticipated show that was created as a companion series to Band of Brothers and The Pacific, both of which were popular when they debuted, so it had a built-in audience. The show is executive produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who also worked on the prior shows.<br/>
<br/>
Masters of the Air debuted on January 26, and episodes are being released weekly. The finale is set to air on Friday, March 15.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/masters-of-the-air-launch-record/">&#039;Masters of the Air&#039; Sees Most Watched Apple TV+ Launch to Date</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/masters-of-the-air-sees-most-watched-apple-tv-launch-to-date.2420010/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to update the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> lineups as soon as March, and the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be significantly thinner according to dimensions shared by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/20/larger-ipad-air-thinner-ipad-pro/">9to5Mac</a></em>. Citing sources with knowledge of Apple's plans, the site claims that the larger version will be more than 1mm thinner.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
The current 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; measures in at 6.4mm thick, but the new model is said to be 5mm thick. As for the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, it is currently 5.9mm thick, while the updated version is said to be 5.1mm thick. Both tablets may also be slightly bigger in size.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Current 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; - 247.6mm x 178.5mm x 5.9 mm</li><br/>
 	<li>Upcoming 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; - 249.7mm x 177.5mm x 5.1mm</li></ul><br/>
 	<br/>
<ul><li>Current 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; - 280.6mm x 214.9mm x 6.4mm</li><br/>
 	<li>Upcoming 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; - 281.5mm x 215.5mm x 5.0mm</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Such a slimmed down body suggests a notable design change, which is enabled by an even more significant update -- OLED display technology. OLED display panels are thinner than LCD panels, allowing Apple to cut down on the thickness of its tablets.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, Apple is expected to introduce two new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models, including a larger 12.9-inch version for the first time. The larger &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be almost the same size as the current &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, measuring in at 280.6mm by 214.9mm by 6mm.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is limiting OLED display technology to the Pro lineup, so while the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be similar in length and width to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, it will be thicker because it will continue to feature an LCD display.<br/>
<br/>
All of the new iPads are expected to have Apple's M3 chip technology, which was first introduced last year in updated MacBook Pro models. We haven't heard specifics about an event, but we are expecting something in late March to early April.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">Apple&#039;s Upcoming OLED iPad Pro Models Rumored to Be Much Thinner</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-models-rumored-to-be-much-thinner.2420001/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that it retested the batteries in all iPhone 15 models and determined that they are able to meet a higher bar.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911429" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106348">support document</a> updated today, Apple says the batteries in the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max are designed to retain 80% of their original capacity at 1,000 complete charge cycles under ideal conditions, compared to the 500 charge cycles it advertises for all older iPhone models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple told <em>MacRumors</em> that its latest testing for iPhone 15 models involved charging and discharging the battery 1,000 times under specific conditions, but it did not provide any exact details about the process. Apple added that it has continually made improvements to iPhone battery components and its power management system.<br/>
<br/>
This revelation means that it could take longer for the maximum battery capacity of iPhone 15 models to decline to 80% compared to previous iPhone models. However, Apple said it is "investigating" the battery lifespans of older iPhone models, so a comparison based on the latest testing parameters remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
In its support document, Apple says the battery lifespan of any iPhone model ultimately depends on how the device is regularly used and charged.<br/>
<br/>
To view an iPhone's battery capacity, open the Settings app and tap Battery → Battery Health & Charging. On iPhone 15 models updated to the latest iOS 17.4 beta, the menu is now simply called Battery Health and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/ios-17-4-iphone-15-battery/">shows more info at a glance</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The team responsible for audio at Apple will soon undergo leadership changes due to the departure of longtime acoustics vice president Gary Geaves, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-20/apple-shuffles-leadership-of-team-responsible-for-audio-products">Bloomberg</a></em>. Geaves is stepping down from his role, though he will be replaced with "top deputy" Ruchir Davé.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/airpods-january.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931748" /><br/>
Apple's acoustics group has approximately 300 members that have developed audio technology for the AirPods, HomePods, and other Apple devices. The team was responsible for creating spatial audio, the 3D sound feature that has been built into AirPods, the Vision Pro, and other devices.<br/>
<br/>
AirPods product designer Tang Tan was overseeing the acoustic team under John Ternus, but he started preparing to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/another-apple-designer-to-work-on-openai-hardware/">leave Apple</a> back in December. Since then, the acoustics team has been reporting to Matt Costello, who oversees the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and Beats headphones.<br/>
<br/>
Geaves joined Apple in 2011 from Bowers &amp; Wilkins, and <em>Bloomberg</em> says he will be staying on at Apple as an advisor to Costello as he prepares to retire. Over the course of the last two years, Geaves has been working on an overhaul to the AirPods lineup, and the first updates are expected this year.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest we will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/airpods-4-new-design/">see AirPods 4</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/new-airpods-later-this-year-rumor/">new AirPods Max</a> this year, with revamped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">to follow in 2025</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-acoustics-vp-leaves-role/">Apple Acoustics VP Leaves Role, AirPods and HomePod Audio Team Gets New Leadership</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-acoustics-vp-leaves-role-airpods-and-homepod-audio-team-gets-new-leadership.2419988/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 17.4, Apple is tweaking how battery health is reported to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> users, making it easier for them to understand their battery status at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ios-17-4-battery-health-optimization-iphone-15.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937223" /><br/>
In the Battery section of the Settings app, the Battery Health listing now has a readout such as "Normal" that is accessible without tapping in to the prior "Battery Health & Charging" section.<br/>
<br/>
If you tap on the battery health readout on an &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, the battery cycle count, manufacture date, and first use will be listed. This information was previously hidden in the General > About section of the Settings app. <br/>
<br/>
The Charging Optimization section continues to provide the same settings. Optimized Battery Charging preserves battery health by learning usage habits and limiting the amount of time that the battery sits at a 100 percent charge. There is also an option to limit charging to 80 percent to further preserve health, and a toggle for turning off optimized charging all together.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The fourth beta of iOS 17.4 that Apple released today adds a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> feature, according to the notes that Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-17_4-release-notes">provided to developers</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908367" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/volvo-s60-drivers-apple-maps.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
In supported &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; vehicles, there's now an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> option to show information about upcoming maneuvers in the instrument cluster. &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; users will be able to swap the display type between the main and instrument cluster by tapping on the map configuration button located in the upper right of the main Maps screen.<br/>
<br/>
Apple this year introduced a new next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; experience that will show up in high-end vehicles starting in 2024, but this feature addition is separate from that.<br/>
<br/>
It appears this new experience will be available in vehicles that support a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/volvo-dual-screen-apple-maps-carplay/">dual-screen Apple Maps CarPlay experience</a>, with a supplementary &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; view that's located in the driver display or head-up display. &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; began supporting this functionality several years ago, but manufacturers have been slow to adopt it with BMW, Volvo, and Polestar being among the first on select vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
While those vehicles have supported an &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; view in the driver display, they have not shown text prompts such as upcoming turns or lane guidance, so it appears today's addition will give users some control about what information appears where.<br/>
<br/>
With the iOS 17.4 update, the driver display will optionally display turn-by-turn directions so that &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; users can navigate without having to look away from the display directly in front of them.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 is limited to developers and public beta testers at this time, but it will see a public release in March.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/ios-17-4-beta-carplay-instrument-cluster/">iOS 17.4 Beta Adds CarPlay Option to Show Upcoming Maneuvers in Instrument Cluster</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-beta-adds-carplay-option-to-show-upcoming-maneuvers-in-instrument-cluster.2419982/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the third beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.1 update for developers, allowing them to test new features ahead of the software seeing a public launch. The third beta comes a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/visionos-1-1-beta-2/">release of the second beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934088" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-Home-Screen.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
The &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 brings support for iMessage Contact Key Verification and it adds Apple device management to the Vision Pro. With this functionality, IT departments at companies and educational institutions can manage Vision Pro headsets in the same way they manage iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's beta notes, users can now reposition volumetric scenes closer than before, enabling easier direct interaction with the volumetric scene content. That means objects can be placed closer to you.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also improved Personas in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1, making them look more natural and lifelike than before. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-releases-third-beta-of-visionos-1-1/">Apple Releases Third Beta of visionOS 1.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-third-beta-of-visionos-1-1.2419977/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932463" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta. A free or paid <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 introduces sweeping changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union, paving the way for alternative app marketplaces, alternative payment systems, third-party browser engine support, and NFC access for banks and third-party payment providers. These features are limited to the EU, and won't be available in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
There are, however, changes to gaming apps, and with the launch of iOS 17.4, Apple will be allowing cloud gaming apps like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW. Mini games, chatbots, and plug-ins are also now able to use the in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
Along with these updates, iOS 17.4 adds new emoji characters, transcripts for podcasts in the Podcasts app, support for using SharePlay with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, Stopwatch Live Activities, and more.

To install the ‌watchOS 10.4‌ update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, watchOS 10.4 can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.4 includes new emoji characters such as a lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).<br/>
<br/>
There is also a Setting to disable the Double Tap feature on Apple Watch when using Vision Pro, as the Double Tap gestures might be accidentally activated when controlling Vision Pro.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-seeds-watchos-10-4-beta-4-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of watchOS 10.4 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-watchos-10-4-to-developers.2419976/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.4 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software releases are usually minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes.<br/>
<br/>
The tvOS 17.4 update adds support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> SharePlay on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. The &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; user can pull up an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; QR code that can be scanned by anyone, which then allows multiple people to contribute to what's playing via &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;.

		<description><![CDATA[iPhone 16 models will feature upgraded microphones with a higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to previous models, allowing for the devices to hear your voice more clearly, according to Haitong analyst Jeff Pu. This upgrade should improve the accuracy of Siri, which is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">revamped with generative AI features on iOS 18</a> later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iOS-18-Mock-iPhone-16-Feature-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936483" /><br/>
In a research note earlier this month, Pu said some of iOS 18's generative AI features will likely be limited to iPhone 16 models, as a result of the upgraded microphones and a larger Neural Engine in the A18 and A18 Pro chips for the devices. Both of these hardware changes have been rumored by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">other</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">sources</a>, increasing their likelihood.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">previously said</a> the upgraded microphones on iPhone 16 models could "improve the Siri experience significantly." In addition to a higher signal-to-noise ratio, he said the new microphones will offer improved water resistance.<br/>
<br/>
On an earnings call earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that the company was working on generative AI and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">will share details "later this year."</a> In addition to Siri, iOS 18 is rumored to add new generative AI capabilities to Spotlight, Shortcuts, Messages, Apple Music, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, Health, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce iOS 18 at WWDC in June, and the update should be released to all users in September alongside the iPhone 16 series.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/iphone-16-upgraded-microphones-rumor/">iPhone 16 Models Again Rumored to Feature Upgraded Microphones for iOS 18&#039;s Revamped Siri</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-models-again-rumored-to-feature-upgraded-microphones-for-ios-18s-revamped-siri.2419966/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> could miss out on Adaptive Audio, according to a rumor coming out of Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Airpods-Max-Feature-Green-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936393" /><br/>
The rumor comes from Weibo user "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Instant Digital</a>," who claims that while new &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; will "definitely" come out this year, the only change will be a USB-C port. The headphones will apparently continue to forgo Adaptive Audio due to the presence of an older processor.<br/>
<br/>
Adaptive Audio encompasses three features: Adaptive Noise Control, Personalized Volume, and Conversation Awareness. Adaptive Noise Control blends Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode to adjust the level of noise control based on the changing noise conditions in your environment, Personalized Volume adjusts the media volume based on environmental conditions and volume preferences, and Conversation Awareness lowers media volume and enhances voices in front of you.<br/>
<br/>
The features are exclusive to the second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> because they require the H2 chip's processing power. The first-generation &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; feature the H1 chip and did not gain Adaptive Audio via a software update as a result. Multiple rumors suggest that the only notable improvement offered by the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; will be a USB-C port instead of Lightning for charging and wired audio playback, potentially alongside some new color options, meaning that the H2 chip will continue to be absent.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;'s &#36;549 price point, the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; might still offer superior hardware and software than their over-ear sibling, touting features such as the H2 chip, Bluetooth 5.3, Adaptive Audio, improved Active Noise Cancellation, skin-detect sensors, sweat and water resistance, the U1 chip, Precision Finding, and support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> and Qi wireless charging. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's refreshed over-ear headphones are expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/new-airpods-later-this-year-rumor/">launch in late 2024</a> alongside two fourth-generation AirPods models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Setsuna Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/airpods-max-2-could-miss-out-on-adaptive-audio/">AirPods Max 2 Could Miss Out on Adaptive Audio Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-max-2-could-miss-out-on-adaptive-audio-features.2419965/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The new &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Replay variant offers a more granular version of the full, annual &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Replay experience offered toward the end of the year, which takes a retrospective look back at a user's entire year of music consumption.<br/>
<br/>
The monthly version of the feature shows the total number of listening minutes for the previous month and top artists, songs, and albums, as well as monthly milestones. This data is archived and continues to be available for revisiting at a later date, allowing users to see go back and see Replays for previous months. <br/>
<br/>
The feature is viewable at <a href="https://replay.music.apple.com/">replay.music.apple.com</a> and remains a browser-only experience. Unlike the annual version, the monthly version of &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Replay does not come with an accompanying playlist that can be added to a user's library or a highlight reel.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-music-launches-monthly-replay-experience/">Apple Music Launches Monthly Replay Experience</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-launches-monthly-replay-experience.2419941/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams is making a rare visit to Taiwan to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Foxconn, one of the company's key suppliers, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-20/apple-s-jeff-williams-makes-rare-taiwan-visit-for-foxconn-gala?"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/foxconn.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-874790" /><br/>
Apple's COO is joined by senior vice president of operations Sabih Khan, as well as representatives from SoftBank and Arm. Foxconn assembles Apple devices including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and MacBook. The supplier is currently helping Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/new-iphone-starts-production-outside-china/">shift some iPhone assembly to India</a> as the company looks to diversify its global supply chain.  <br/>
<br/>
Williams last visited Taiwan in 2017 for TSMC's 30th anniversary celebrations. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> has not visited Taiwan since 2008. Williams spearheaded development of the Apple Watch and Apple's various health initiatives. He now oversees many vital areas of the company, including hardware and software design.<br/>
<br/>
Williams is reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/11/report-outlines-apple-senior-executive-successors/">the frontrunner to succeed Cook</a> as Apple's CEO. He is apparently "seen as the heir apparent" within the company, having run Apple's global operations under Cook's leadership, a role that Cook previously undertook for Steve Jobs prior to becoming CEO himself.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's surprise decision to bring RCS support to its Messages app for iPhone later this year was not a result of impending EU legislation, but an about-face caused by Chinese political pressure, claimed a report over the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-rcs-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2776" height="1562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923042" /><br/>
In November 2023, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">announced</a> that it planned to bring RCS (Rich Communication Services) support to Messages alongside iMessage, a move that seemingly came out of the blue, given Apple's staunch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/tim-cook-on-ios-rcs-buy-your-mom-an-iphone/">resistance</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/google-ipager-ad-rcs-apple/">pressure from Google</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/samsung-pushes-apple-to-adopt-rcs/">Samsung</a> to adopt the communication protocol.<br/>
<br/>
In the weeks that followed, one popular theory for Apple's reversal was that its hand had been forced by the EU's Digital Markets Act, which would have required Apple to make changes to iMessage to make it interoperable with other platforms.<br/>
<br/>
That theory has since been debunked for two reasons. First, the DMA does not specifically mention RCS as a requirement of interoperability between messaging platforms. And second, the EU earlier this month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/imessage-avoids-eu-regulation/">concluded</a> that iMessage does not hold a dominant enough position to be brought under the DMA's strict rules for services provided by big tech's so-called digital "gatekeepers."<br/>
<br/>
A more plausible theory has since been offered by John Gruber, who says "little birdies" (Gruber's code for sources at Apple) tell him that "iOS support for RCS is all about China." <br/>
<br/>
Writing on his blog <em><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/eu_rcs_imessage">Daring Fireball</a></em>, Gruber points to China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which in July 2023 solicited feedback for upcoming rules that would require new 5G devices to support RCS (an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalProfile/comments/153rrwl/chinas_proposed_regulation_could_force_apple_to/">English translation of the law can be found on Reddit</a>). <br/>
<br/>
"I can't say for certain," admits Gruber, "but after spending the last few months periodically poking around the trees inhabited by little birdies, I do have good news for fans of coercive government regulation. Apple's hand was effectively forced. But by China, not the EU."<br/>
<br/>
As Gruber notes, reports that Apple's decision was influenced by inbound EU regulations subsequently make "zero sense." Apple would prefer, says Gruber, "simply to continue ignoring RCS, on the grounds that they want to support neither any new non-E2EE protocols, nor any new carrier-controlled protocols (whether encrypted or not). But when the [Chinese Communist Party] says device makers must jump to sell their products in China, Apple asks 'How high?'"<br/>
<br/>
Gruber's full piece is worth a read over on <em><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/eu_rcs_imessage">Daring Fireball</a></em>. As for RCS coming to the Messages app, support for the protocol should result in several improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices, such as higher-resolution photos, audio messages, read receipts, improved group chats, and typing indicators.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said RCS support in Messages would arrive "later" in 2024, which corresponds with the timeframe we expect iOS 18 to be released, suggesting it could be a feature of Apple's next major software update. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/daringfireball-net/">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-rcs-message-compliance-china-law/">Apple Likely Adopting RCS Messaging Standard to Comply With Chinese Law</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-adopting-rcs-messaging-standard-to-comply-with-chinese-law.2419937/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
