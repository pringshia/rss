		<description><![CDATA[Apple has expanded its production footprint in the United States, with its S9 chip for the Apple Watch now reportedly being manufactured at TSMC's facility in Arizona.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/s9-chip-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1501" height="844" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913379" /><br/>
According to technology columnist <a href="https://www.culpium.com/p/apple-doubles-down-with-second-chip">Tim Culpan</a>, TSMC has now started producing Apple's S9 System-in-Package (SiP) chip near Phoenix, Arizona at its Fab 21 plant. The company commenced production of the A16 Bionic chip for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus at the facility last year.<br/>
<br/>
The S9 debuted in the Apple Watch Series 9 in late 2023, based on processing features derived from the A16 Bionic chip. Both products are produced using TSMC's 4-nanometer process technology, known simply as "N4." This shared technological foundation reportedly allowed TSMC to efficiently adapt its Arizona production line to accommodate the S9 alongside the A16. While the Apple Watch Series 9 is now out of production, the S9 chip is still used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, which was introduced at the same time. <br/>
<br/>
While the A16 Bionic has been in production at Fab 21 since September 2024, the addition of the S9 SiP reflects an accelerated ramp-up in operations at the Arizona facility. The Arizona plant represents TSMC's first major semiconductor manufacturing site outside Taiwan, but production capacity at the facility has remained in its early stages.<br/>
<br/>
The current operational phase (Phase 1A) has a monthly output of approximately 10,000 wafers. These wafers are shared between the Apple A16 and S9 chips, and other clients such as AMD. Each wafer can yield hundreds of chips, depending on die size, design, and production efficiency. The completion of Phase 1B is expected to double the facility's capacity to 24,000 wafers per month early this year. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/apple-watch-chips-now-being-made-in-the-u-s/">Apple Watch Chips Now Being Made in the U.S. for the First Time</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-chips-now-being-made-in-the-u-s-for-the-first-time.2446975/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in October 2024 overhauled its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, adding M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, Thunderbolt 5 ports on higher-end models, display changes, and more. That's quite a lot of updates in one go, but if you think this means a further major refresh for the MacBook Pro is now several years away, think again.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/M6-MacBook-Pro-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984552" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-03/apple-finally-finds-its-game-console-rival-with-the-new-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-minis-m31na57p"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> has said he expects only a small performance boost for the 2025 MacBook Pro models with the introduction of new M5 chips, while the "true overhaul" for the laptop will come in 2026. So if you are planning to skip this year's MacBook Pro, or you're just plain curious about what's two generations away, here are five big changes rumored to come to Apple's premium laptop line next year.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">OLED Display </span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Goodbye, mini-LED</span><br><br/>
Several rumors have indicated that the first MacBook Pro models with OLED displays will be released in 2026. Research firm Omdia <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/oled-macbook-pro-could-launch-as-soon-as-2026/">claims</a> Apple is "highly likely" to introduce new MacBook Pros featuring OLED displays next year, while display analyst Ross Young has said that Apple's supply chain is expected to have sufficient notebook-optimized OLED display production capacity in 2026 to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/macbook-pro-wont-switch-to-oled-in-2025-rumor/">bring the technology to MacBook Pro</a>. Compared to current MacBook Pro models that use mini-LED screens, the benefits of OLED technology would include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, improved power efficiency for longer battery life, and more. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Thinner, Lighter Laptop</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Major Redesign</span><br><br/>
The switch to OLED displays could allow future MacBook Pro models to have a thinner design, and rumors suggest that is indeed what Apple intends. When the M4 iPad Pro was unveiled in May 2024, Apple touted it as the company's thinnest product ever. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> subsequently called the iPad Pro the "beginning of a new class of Apple devices," and said Apple was working to make the MacBook Pro thinner over the "next couple of years." Apple is reportedly focusing on delivering the thinnest possible device without compromising on battery life or major new features.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, the MacBook Pro got thicker and heavier with its most recent redesign in 2021. A major highlight was the reintroduction of several ports that were removed in previous iterations in favor of chassis thinness. How Apple will make its 2026 MacBook Pro thinner without removing the functionality it reintroduced fairly recently is the big question.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Punch-Hole Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">No More Notch</span><br><br/>
If you are fed up of the notch intruding on your Mac display, here's some good news. Apple plans to remove the notch from the MacBook Pro in 2026, according to a roadmap shared by research firm <a href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1864535769668571431">Omdia</a>. The roadmap indicates that 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models released next year will have a hole-punch camera at the top of the display, rather than the notch we've become accustomed to. A MacBook Pro without a notch would offer additional visible pixels on the screen, creating a more uninterrupted and cohesive display design.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">5G Modem</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Cellular Connectivity</span><br><br/>
Early in 2025, Apple plans to introduce the custom-built 5G chip that it's had in the works for years now. The modem chip will be added to the iPhone SE, low-cost iPad, and iPhone 17 "Air," giving Apple an opportunity to test the technology before rolling it out to flagship devices. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, Apple will then consider <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-cellular-mac-custom-modem/">bringing cellular connectivity to the Mac lineup</a> for the first time. The company is said to be "investigating" the possibility of adding a second-generation modem chip to a future Mac as soon as 2026, teasing the potential for a cellular MacBook Pro in the same year. The first Apple modem chip will be limited to sub-6GHz 5G speeds, but the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/">second-generation version</a> will support faster mmWave technology, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">M6 Series Chip</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">2nm Process</span><br><br/>
Assuming Apple follows a similar timeframe to its M4 chip rollout, Apple will update the MacBook Pro lineup in October this year with M5 series chips. The chips will be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P, resulting in typical year-over-year performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the M4 series of chips. M6 chips, on the other hand, could adopt a completely new packaging process for Apple's 2026 MacBook Pro models. <br/>
<br/>
According to one <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/iphone-18-enhanced-2nm-chip-12gb-ram/">rumor</a>, Apple's A20 chip in next year's iPhone 18 models will switch from the previous InFo (Integrated Fan-Out) packaging to WMCM (Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module) packaging. WMCM integrates multiple chips within the same package, allowing for the development of more complex chipsets. Components such as the CPU, GPUs, DRAM, and Neural Engine would therefore be more tightly integrated. While we don't know for sure, this could see Apple develop the M6 using the 2nm process while taking advantage of WMCM packaging to make even more powerful versions of its custom processor.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/5-reasons-to-wait-for-next-years-macbook-pro/">5 Reasons to Wait for Next Year&#039;s MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/5-reasons-to-wait-for-next-years-macbook-pro.2446971/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18.4 is expected to be released in April with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/03/siri-2025-updates/">several new Apple Intelligence enhancements for Siri</a>, including on-screen awareness, deeper per-app controls, and better understanding of a user's personal context. However, an even bigger upgrade planned for Siri is still more than a year away, according to a recent report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iOS-19-Roundup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979789" /><br/>
A few months ago, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-21/apple-readies-more-conversational-llm-siri-in-bid-to-rival-openai-s-chatgpt">said</a> iOS 19 will introduce a "more conversational" version of Siri powered by "more advanced large language models." He said this upgrade will make Siri more like ChatGPT, allowing the assistant to "handle more sophisticated requests" and better respond to "back-and-forth conversations."<br/>
<br/>
Apple will likely preview the more conversational version of Siri when it announces iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 in June, but Gurman said it will not be available until as early as spring 2026. That suggests the feature will be released as part of an iOS 19.4 update, which is likely to be released in March or April next year.<br/>
<br/>
Siri was already inferior to competing voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant, and the rise of chatbots like ChatGPT and Google's Gemini set Siri even further behind. With the enhancements coming between the iOS 18.4 and iOS 19.4 updates, Siri should finally see some meaningful improvements.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It was recently reported that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/">new Apple TV and new HomePod mini models will launch this year</a>, and the devices are expected to have one thing in common.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/HomePod-mini-and-Apple-TV.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984533" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last month reported that the new Apple TV and the new HomePod mini will be equipped with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">Apple's own combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a>. Gurman said the chip supports Wi-Fi 6E, so that could end up being a key upgrade for both devices. Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible router. <br/>
<br/>
The current Apple TV from October 2022 supports Wi-Fi 6, and the upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E seems likely. It is unclear if the Wi-Fi 6E capability will be enabled in the next HomePod mini, however, as Apple has generally kept its HomePod speakers on older Wi-Fi versions. For example, the current HomePod mini supports outdated Wi-Fi 4.<br/>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, the next Apple TV is also expected to be equipped with a newer A-series chip for faster performance. The current Apple TV is equipped with the A15 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 13 models in 2021. Apple has released several newer A-series chips since then, including the A16 Bionic, A17 Pro, A18, and A18 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The next Apple TV could have lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">could have a sub-&#36;100 starting price</a>. In the U.S., the current Apple TV is available with 64GB or 128GB of storage for &#36;129 and &#36;149, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.<br/>
<br/>
As for the HomePod mini, likely upgrades for the next model include a newer "S" chip, improved sound quality, a newer Ultra Wideband chip for a lower-latency Handoff experience, and fresh color options. The current HomePod mini was released in November 2020 and uses the Apple Watch Series 5's S5 chip.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to a new HomePod mini, Apple reportedly plans to release an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">all-new smart home hub</a> at some point this year. The hub is expected to feature around a six-inch display that can be mounted on a wall, or attached to a tabletop base with a speaker, so the device could be similar to the HomePod mini in some ways.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/new-apple-tv-and-homepod-mini-common-feature/">New Apple TV and HomePod Mini Launching This Year With One Thing in Common</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-tv-and-homepod-mini-launching-this-year-with-one-thing-in-common.2446966/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is still barred from selling iPhone 16 models in Indonesia despite agreeing to build a local production facility there, as it has not met domestic content rules, the country's industry minister said on Wednesday (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-still-barred-selling-iphone-16-indonesia-despite-investment-deal-minister-2025-01-08/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-16-Apple-Store.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976828" /><br/>
Indonesia's minister of industry, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, reportedly met with Apple's VP of global government affairs, Nick Ammann, on January 7 to discuss Apple's investment proposal. However, Agus later implied that the company's proposal was not yet adequate. "If it is &#36;1 billion, then that is not enough," he told reporters after the meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Indonesian authorities <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/indonesia-bans-iphone-16-sales/">banned</a> iPhone 16 sales after they determined Apple had failed to meet the country's requirement for 35% domestic content in smartphones. Apple has since offered a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-raises-indonesia-investment-offer-iphone-ban/">&#36;1 billion</a> investment in the country that includes building an AirTag factory. Apple's offer is a significant increase from its previous offers of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/indonesia-iphone-ban-apple-10m-investment/">&#36;10 million</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ups-invest-offer-indonesia-iphone-16-ban/">&#36;100 million</a>, which were rejected by the government.<br/>
<br/>
Agus confirmed Apple had agreed to build a facility producing AirTag tracking devices on Indonesia's Batam island, close to Singapore, but that still would not count as a locally-made iPhone part.<br/>
<blockquote>"There is no basis for the ministry to issue a local content certification as a way for Apple to have the permission to sell iPhone 16 because (the facility) has no direct relations," he said, adding the ministry would only count phone components.</blockquote>Indonesia's investment minister on Tuesday said the factory would start operations next year. The agreement will be seen as a success for President Prabowo's efforts to attract foreign investment while demonstrating the effectiveness of Indonesia's strategy to pressure international companies into developing products locally. The country remains a significant market for Apple, with over half of its 278 million residents under the age of 44.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/">Indonesia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/iphone-16-still-banned-indonesia-1b-deal/">iPhone 16 Still Banned in Indonesia Despite &#36;1B Apple Investment Deal</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-still-banned-in-indonesia-despite-1b-apple-investment-deal.2446961/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Razer <a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/ces-2025/">today introduced</a> Project Arielle, a next-generation conceptual gaming chair that it is developing. The mesh gaming chair has integrated heating and cooling functions thanks to a bladeless fan system located at the base of the backrest.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Razer Project Arielle World's First Heating &amp; Cooling Mesh Gaming Chair" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8grHBWtgjDQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The chair offers three adjustable fan speeds for personalized cooling, and Razer says that the heat dissipation offered by the airflow can reduce perceived temperatures by up 2°C to 5°C in dry environments.<br/>
<br/>
When it's cooler, there's a built-in heating system that uses energy-efficient PTC heatings delivering up to 30°C of warm air. According to Razer, the chair's noise level is as "soft as a whisper," with the various functions able to be controlled through a touch panel on the chair's arm.<br/>
<br/>
Razer also demoed Project Ava, a conceptual AI gaming copilot designed to provide real-time insights from esports coaches and information on hardware optimizations to improve gaming performance.<br/>
<br/>

As for products that are actually available, Razer debuted PC Remote Play for streaming full-resolution games from PCs to mobile devices, and a new Razer Blade 16 gaming laptop. Razer says that the new Razer Blade 16 is its thinnest gaming laptop to date, with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 laptop GPU and AMD Ryzen 9 AI processors.

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier today, we reported on a proven leaker's claim that a new iPhone SE and iPad 11 would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-launch-timing/">released alongside iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3</a>. Just minutes later, however, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman put the kibosh on that rumor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-SE-4-Single-Camera-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978494" /><br/>
In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1876731783586136304">social media post</a>, Gurman said an iPhone SE replacement and new iPads are "being developed on the iOS 18.3 train," but that "doesn't mean" the software updates and the devices will launch simultaneously. Instead, Gurman said Apple is aiming to release the devices "by April," at some point "before iOS 18.4" is released.<br/>
<br/>
So, there you have it. Sometimes one rumor quickly leads to another, and now we have a clearer timeframe for the launch of these devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-by-april/">Apple Aiming to Launch iPhone SE 4 and iPad 11 &#039;By April&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-aiming-to-launch-iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-by-april.2446925/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The 2025 Swift Student Challenge that's taking place ahead of WWDC is set to begin on Monday, February 3, Apple announced today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/">on its developer website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969979" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/2025-Swift-Student-Challenge.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" /><br/>
With the Swift Student Challenge, students from around the world can showcase their coding skills and creativity by developing app concepts using Swift Playgrounds or Xcode. The contest also provides students with the chance to learn real-world skills that can be used in their future careers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to host an online session that will provide students and educators with more information on participating in the Swift Student Challenge. The session will explore the elements of great apps with an Apple engineer, provide tips from a former Challenge winner, and offer inspiration for app playgrounds. Apple has also updated Develop in Swift Tutorials to help students learn the foundations of coding.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said it will select 350 winners based on "innovation, creativity, social impact, or inclusivity." 50 of the winners will be invited to spend three days at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> in Cupertino, California this summer. The trip generally coincides with Apple's annual WWDC event, which is often held in June.<br/>
<br/>
Back in October, Apple gave students a heads up that the Swift Student Challenge would take place in February, but exact dates weren't provided at the time. Submissions will open on February 3, 2025, and will remain open for a three-week period.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/apple-swift-student-challenge-february-3/">Apple&#039;s WWDC 2025 Swift Student Challenge Starts on February 3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-wwdc-2025-swift-student-challenge-starts-on-february-3.2446922/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>New iPhone SE and iPad 11 Launch Timing Allegedly Revealed by Leaker</title>

		<description><![CDATA[A new iPhone SE and an iPad 11 might be coming very soon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
In late December, a private account on X with a track record of leaking accurate iOS-related information said devices codenamed "V59" and "J481" will be released alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/apple-releases-ios-18-3-beta-2/">iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has previously reported that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-01/apple-readies-iphone-se-4-upgraded-ipad-air-for-early-2025">"V59" is a new iPhone SE</a>, and that <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1871298143494795319">"J481" is a new entry-level iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 15.3, iOS 16.3, and iOS 17.3 were all released in late January over the past three years, so iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 will likely be released later this month if that trend continues. If so, that means the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 could also be released this January, assuming that the leaker is accurate about these releases being coupled.<br/>
<br/>
As requested, we have not linked to the leaker's private account, but they have proven to be a reliable source over the past few years.<br/>
<br/>
All three iPhone SE models released to date were announced in March or April over the years, so a January announcement of an iPhone SE 4 would be earlier than usual. Another <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/01/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-be-named-iphone-16e/">rumored name for the device is iPhone 16E</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There is one potential reason why it would make sense for the new iPhone SE to launch this January. Apple recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/27/apple-stops-selling-iphone-14-and-se-in-eu/">stopped selling the current iPhone SE with a Lightning port in the EU</a>, due to a USB-C regulation there. The new iPhone SE is expected to have a USB-C port, and by releasing it this month instead of in March or April, Apple would be getting the iPhone SE back on sale in the EU a few months sooner.<br/>
<br/>
The new iPhone SE is said to have a similar design as the base iPhone 14. Rumored features for the device include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, a newer A-series chip and 8GB of RAM <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/">for Apple Intelligence support</a>, and the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-5g-modem-plans-report/">Apple-designed 5G modem</a>. It is not entirely clear if the device will have an Action button, which debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the current iPhone SE during an online event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-announces-new-iphone-se/">in March 2022</a>. The device looks similar to the iPhone 8, with outdated features such as a Touch ID button, Lightning port, and thick bezels around the display. In the U.S., the iPhone SE currently starts at &#36;429, but at least a slight price increase seems probable for the next model.<br/>
<br/>
As for the iPad 11, it has been said that the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/entry-level-ipad-apple-intelligence-late-2025/">should support Apple Intelligence</a>. That means it would have a newer A-series chip compared to the iPad 10, and an increased 8GB of RAM, to power those features. At this point, no major design changes have been rumored for the device. Apple announced the iPad 10 in October 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman recently said new MacBook Air models would be announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/macbook-air-with-m4-chip-launch-timing/">before the new iPhone SE and iPad 11</a>, so perhaps the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air will receive their rumored upgrade to the M4 chip this month as well.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1876729800074649706">social media post</a>, Gurman said these alleged iPhone SE 4 launch details are "completely untrue."<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-launch-timing/">New iPhone SE and iPad 11 Launch Timing Allegedly Revealed by Leaker</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-11-launch-timing-allegedly-revealed-by-leaker.2446919/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today provided developers with the second beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.3 update, with the second beta coming three weeks after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/apple-seeds-first-macos-sequoia-15-3-beta/">released the first beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macOS-Sequoia-Night-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961501" /><br/>
Registered developers can opt-in to the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.3 brings <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a> to the Mac, a feature that was previously limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. With &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;, Mac users can create custom characters with a text-based prompt, similar to how <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a> works.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; characters behave just like emoji on devices running iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, ‌&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;‌ 15.1 and later, but on earlier versions of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and Android devices, &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; are sent as images. &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; can be added from the emoji interface, and image generation is done on-device.<br/>
<br/>
All macs with an Apple silicon chip support &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; and other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/apple-releases-macos-sequoia-15-3-beta-2/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of macOS Sequoia 15.3 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-macos-sequoia-15-3-to-developers.2446912/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second betas of upcoming iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming three weeks after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/apple-releases-ios-18-3-beta-1/">released the first betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980522" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Generic-iOS-18.3-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 can be downloaded from the Settings app on a compatible device by going to General &gt; Software update.<br/>
<br/>
There are no new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features in iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3, and the updates are available to all compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models. The update is expected to bring support for robot vacuums in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, but there were no notable changes found in the first beta.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today provided developers with the second betas of upcoming watchOS 11.3, tvOS 18.3, and visionOS 2.3 updates for testing purposes.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918420" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-TV-4K-hero-221018-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2322" height="1306" /><br/>
The betas are available to registered developers, and can be downloaded from the settings app on each device.<br/>
<br/>
There were no notable new features found in the updates, but code suggests that Apple will add support for robot vacuums to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, which means it will be a supported category in the Home app in visionOS, tvOS, and watchOS.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 18.3 code suggests we won't be getting new TV and Movies and Soundscapes screen savers, which Apple had announced back in June. References to these screen savers have now been eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/whats-new-in-tvos-18-3-so-far/">add a new notice</a> about digital movie and TV show sales in tvOS 18.3.<br/>
<br/>
We are expecting tvOS 18.3, watchOS 11.3, and visionOS 2.3 to be released sometime in late January alongside iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.3.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/apple-releases-watchos-11-3-beta-2/">Apple Seeds Second Betas of watchOS 11.3, tvOS 18.3 and visionOS 2.3 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-betas-of-watchos-11-3-tvos-18-3-and-visionos-2-3-to-developers.2446913/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/">Nanoleaf</a>, known for its popular HomeKit-connected light panels, today announced the launch of several new Nanoleaf devices and an expansion into a new product category.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/nanoleaf-face-mask-leds.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984308" /><br/>
The new Nanoleaf LED Light Therapy Face Mask is a skincare device that uses LEDs to deliver Near Infrared Light (NIR) to treat skin concerns that include fine lines, acne, and uneven skin tone. Along with red light, which studies have suggested can help with skin firming, Nanoleaf's mask also provides light in other colors that include blue, white, cyan, green, and yellow.<br/>
<br/>
There are seven modes that Nanoleaf says target specific skin concerns, with the mask designed to ergonomically fit the contours of the face. The LED Light Therapy Mask is priced at &#36;150 and it can be pre-ordered from the <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/">Nanoleaf website</a> starting today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/nanoleaf-face-mask-on.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1629" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984309" /><br/>
Nanoleaf's new &#36;100 Smart Multicolor Floor Lamp has a design similar to the Hue Signe. Like the Nanoleaf light panels, the Floor Lamp connects to the Nanoleaf app and to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> over Matter. It supports more than 16 million colors and offers music syncing and color gradients with Nanoleaf's in-app scenes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/nanoleaf-floor-lamp.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984310" /><br/>
The Smart Multicolor Floor Lamp can be pre-ordered from the <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/">Nanoleaf website</a> today.<br/>
<br/>
For PC users and TV owners, Nanoleaf has two new lightstrips that can better fit onto the contours of a screen. A zig-zag design allows it to fit correctly around corners, and the design is more flexible and bendable. The PC Screen Mirror Lightstrip can mirror the colors of games and movies for a dynamic watching experience (no Mac compatibility), and the same is true of the 4D V2 when it's connected to a TV. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/nanoleaf-light-strip.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984311" /><br/>
With the 4D V2, there is an included camera that picks up the colors on the screen to change the color of the lightstrip in real-time. Both the PC Lightstrip and the 4D V2 for TVs will launch in the second quarter of 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/nanoleaf-tv-light-strip.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984312" /><br/>
Along with these new devices, Nanoleaf announced Nanoleaf Premium, a software subscription service that is designed for the Nanoleaf Desktop app that works with PCs. Nanoleaf Premium includes Orchestrator for detecting specific songs and creating animations tailored to each track, and it offers Scenescapes, a feature that combines lighting effects and soothing sounds. Nanoleaf Premium is available today and it is priced at &#36;1.99 per month or &#36;19.99 per year.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/nanoleaf-led-face-mask/">Nanoleaf Launches LED Light Therapy Face Mask, Floor Lamp, Lightstrips and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nanoleaf-launches-led-light-therapy-face-mask-floor-lamp-lightstrips-and-more.2446904/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 18.2, Apple introduced a way for users to select their preferred default apps for iPhone. Apple initially promised that the feature would be coming to the European Union, but it is actually available worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Change-Default-Browser-App-2025-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-984459" /><br/>
<h2>The Freedom to Choose – Why It Matters</h2><br/>
The freedom to choose default apps on iPhone represents a marked shift in Apple's traditionally closed ecosystem, giving you more control over how you interact with your device. Rather than being locked into Safari for web browsing or Apple Mail for email, you can now set third-party alternatives like Chrome, Firefox, Gmail, or Outlook as your go-to apps. <br/>
<br/>
This means when you tap a link or email address, your iPhone will automatically open your preferred app instead of Apple's built-in options. The change effectively eliminates the extra steps of manually copying and pasting content between apps or navigating through share sheets to get to the apps you actually want to use. <br/>
<br/>
In iOS 18.2, there are Default App settings for <strong>Email</strong>, <strong>Messaging</strong>, <strong>Calling</strong>, <strong>Call Filtering</strong>, <strong>Browser App</strong>, <strong>Passwords and Codes</strong>, and <strong>Keyboards</strong>. For users in the European Union, there is also an additional <strong>App Installation</strong> option to choose an alternative app marketplace instead of the App Store. <br/>
<br/>
On iPhones in select countries and regions, another option called <strong>Contactless Apps</strong> appears that lets you choose another app apart from the Wallet app to make contactless transactions using your device's NFC technology. Contactless Apps is available in the European Economic Area (European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway), Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Set Default Apps on iPhone and iPad</h2><br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone or iPad (running iOS 18.2/iPadOS 18.2 or later).</li><br/>
  <li>Scroll to the bottom and select <strong>Apps</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Default Apps</strong> at the top of your list of apps.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/change-default-iphone-apps2.jpg" alt="settings" width="2760" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984388" /><br/>
  <li>Tap a feature to change your default setting to a different app.</li><br/>
<li>Follow any additional onscreen steps if necessary to set up your default app.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/change-default-iphone-apps1.jpg" alt="settings" width="2760" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984390" /><br/>
</ol>In some cases, only one app at a time can be the default app for a feature. In other cases, you can prioritize the apps your device uses. If you can't see an option to set a particular app as the default for a feature, it's best to contact the app developer.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/set-default-iphone-apps/">How to Change Your Default iPhone Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-change-your-default-iphone-apps.2446899/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Vision Pro to Support NVIDIA&#039;s &#039;GeForce NOW&#039; Cloud Gaming Service via Safari</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset will soon support NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform, the company today <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-ces-2025/">announced</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/nvidia-geforce-now-mac.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="627" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-844048" /><br/>
NVIDIA announced at CES 2025 that it is collaborating with Apple to bring GeForce NOW to the Vision Pro using Safari, with updates to the platform expected to roll out later this month. This will enable users to access AAA titles with the power of NVIDIA's RTX technologies that leverage technologies like ray tracing and DLSS.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; owners will gain access to NVIDIA's extensive library of over 2,100 supported titles via the cloud, including upcoming AAA games such as <em>Avowed</em> and <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em>, without the need for local processing or a downloaded library. Using Safari eliminates the need for a Progressive Web App (PWA) installation, which has previously been a requirement on other Apple platforms.<br/>
<br/>
GeForce NOW support on the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; is set to debut later this month, with the rollout of GeForce NOW app version 2.0.70. Users will be able to stream games through Safari on the Vision Pro by navigating to the platform's website, <a href="http://play.geforcenow.com">play.geforcenow.com</a>, once the update becomes available. In addition to the Vision Pro, GeForce NOW will soon support other mixed-reality headsets, including the Meta Quest 3 and Pico devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2025/">CES 2025</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geforce-now/">GeForce Now</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nvidia/">Nvidia</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/vision-pro-to-support-geforce-now/">Apple Vision Pro to Support NVIDIA&#039;s &#039;GeForce NOW&#039; Cloud Gaming Service via Safari</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-to-support-nvidias-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-via-safari.2446892/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week began selling refurbished iPhone 15 models for the first time in <a href="https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/refurbished/iphone/iphone-15">France</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/de/shop/refurbished/iphone">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/it/shop/refurbished/iphone/iphone-15">Italy</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/es/shop/refurbished/iphone/iphone-15">Spain</a>, offering the prior-generation iPhones at a discount for the first time since their 2023 launch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912514" /><br/>
The iPhone 15 is available in the above countries with a 15% discount compared to the equivalent brand new models. Currently only 128GB and 256GB versions are available, but more are likely to arrive soon. The iPhone 15 Plus is also expected to become available in the coming days, as are the discontinued iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, since these models are now listed in the sidebar of the regional refurb stores but are currently greyed out.<br/>
<br/>
All refurbished iPhones from Apple are unlocked and compatible with any carrier. Each refurbished iPhone is equipped with a new battery, a new outer shell, and a USB-C to USB-C cable, making them virtually indistinguishable from brand-new devices.<br/>
<br/>
Refurbished iPhones also come with Apple's standard one-year warranty, and buyers have the option to extend coverage with AppleCare+.<br/>
<br/>
With the launch of the iPhone 16, ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max in September 2024, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-discontinues-iphone-15-pro-iphone-13/">discontinued</a> the iPhone 15 Pro and ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro Max. Apple continues to sell new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models on its main online storefront.<br/>
