		<description><![CDATA[With New Year's Eve and New Year's Day approaching, many <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users may need to get the most out of their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s battery life for extended parties and other festivities. We've rounded up some helpful battery tips that you might want to put into action to ensure your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; keeps working long into the night.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/best-early-black-friday-iphone-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920873" /><br/>
<h2>1. Disable Haptic Keyboard Feedback</h2><br/>
If you've turned on the keyboard option that provides haptic feedback when you tap the on-screen keys, you might want to turn it off temporarily because it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/20/ios-16-haptic-keyboard-battery-life/">can affect battery life</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/haptic-keyboard-feedback.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1961" /><br/>
Here's how to turn it off:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Open up the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on Sounds & Haptics.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on Keyboard Feedback.</li><br/>
 	<li>Toggle off Haptic.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
<h2>2. Turn Off Proximity AirDrop Sharing</h2><br/>
When you hold two iPhones running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> together, or an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 or later, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; initiates a proximity-based AirDrop or contact transfer protocol. If you're continually triggering this, it can drain battery, so if your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is near many other iPhones and you're getting the AirDrop interface over and over again, you should turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905665" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airdrop-proximity-sharing.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1327" /><br/>
To do so, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; AirDrop and toggle off "Bringing Devices Together."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>3. Use Offline Maps</h2><br/>
If you're traveling somewhere, you can save some battery life if you download <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> for offline usage, a feature available on iPhones running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; or later. Offline maps are especially useful if you're going somewhere with poor cellular connectivity because you can get turn-by-turn directions without the battery drain. Just make sure to turn cellular off in spotty areas.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899235" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Maps-Offline.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
Downloading a map is as simple as searching for a location, tapping on the download button, and selecting the area of the map to download. We have a dedicated how-to that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-offline-maps-ios-apple-maps/">walks you through all of the steps</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>4. Turn Off Live Activities</h2><br/>
Live Activities let apps keep an ongoing notification on the Lock Screen or in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, which can cause noticeable battery drain.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-849710" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/ios-16-live-activities-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Live Activities can be disabled by following these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Open up the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Go to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> &amp; Passcode.</li><br/>
 	<li>Enter your passcode to unlock the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
 	<li>Scroll down and toggle off Live Activities.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
This will prevent Live Activities from showing up on the Lock Screen, but you'll want to take this one step further. In the individual app sections in the Settings app, you can disable Live Activities on an app-by-app basis, or avoid using Live Activities features within apps.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>5. Turn Off Always-On Display</h2><br/>
If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the always-on display leaves the time, your wallpaper, widgets, and Live Activities visible on the Lock Screen even when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-864733" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/turn-off-always-on-display.jpg" alt="settings" width="640" height="408" /><br/>
The display uses a 1Hz refresh rate to preserve battery, and the display turns off when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is in a pocket, but always-on display still drains battery faster than no always-on display.<br/>
<br/>
You can turn off the Always-On display by following these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Open up the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on Display &amp; Brightness.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on Always On Display.</li><br/>
 	<li>Toggle off Always On Display.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
It's not entirely clear just how much battery life the always-on display drains because it's going to vary from use case to use case, but even if it's only a few percent, it can be worth turning off.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>6. Use Focus Modes</h2><br/>
Apple's built-in Focus option can cut down on the number of notifications that you're receiving, and fewer notifications means less opportunity for apps to wake up your display and cause battery drain.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850799" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/ios-16-lock-screen-focus.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1250" /><br/>
Focus modes let you choose which apps and people can send you notifications and when, so during work hours you can make sure you're only getting work notifications, and during personal time, you can limit your work notifications. You can limit notifications when driving, when you're asleep, when you're working out, and in any other scenario you can think of.<br/>
<br/>
You'll still get all of your notifications when the Focus mode ends, but all in one alert rather than multiple. Turning off unwanted notifications from apps is still the best method for saving battery life, but Focus modes let you keep your notifications while still cutting down on the number that you receive.<br/>
<br/>
Apple made Focus modes relatively easy to set up, but it still takes some work to get everything running, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-16-focus/">we have a dedicated Focus guide</a>. You can find all of the Focus features in the Focus section of the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>7. Limit When and How Often Apps Can Access Location</h2><br/>
It's always good to check in on privacy and access settings to make sure apps and services aren't doing things you don't want them to be doing.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872415" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/ios-16-location-services.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1299" /><br/>
Limiting the apps that have access to your location and how often apps can access that data can save battery life.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Open up the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Choose Privacy &amp; Security.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap Location Services.</li><br/>
 	<li>Review the list and edit settings by tapping on the name of each app in the list.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
You have four possible choices for location settings for each app, though not all four choices will always be available for every app depending on what it does. You can select the following: Never, Ask Next Time Or When I Share, While Using the App, and Always.<br/>
<br/>
Never will prevent an app from ever accessing your location, and unless there's a specific need for an app to know where you are, such as a mapping app, setting location access to Never is the best choice. While Using the App allows the app to detect your location only when the app is open and being actively used. If you close the app or switch over to another app, location access ends. This is the second best setting to use.<br/>
<br/>
Ask Next Time Or When I Share will prompt an app to ask you with a pop-up the next time that it wants your location, so you can temporarily approve it. With this setting, location access is off until expressly allowed via the pop-up. Always lets an app to have access to your location at all times, regardless of whether it's open or closed. This will result in the most battery drain and should be limited to only the apps that you need the most.<br/>
<br/>
Many apps ask for location information that don't really need it to function (for example, a banking app might want location access to show nearby ATMs, which is also available through entering a zip code), so clearing the cruft will ensure no apps are accessing your location without express permission.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="13._use_low_power_mode">8. Use Low Power Mode</h2><br/>
Turning on Low Power Mode is an obvious choice for maintaining battery without having to hassle with a lot of settings, and you can toggle it on from Control Center, the Battery section of the Settings app, or using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205234">Low Power Mode</a> cuts down on background activity, turns off your display after inactivity more quickly, limits display refresh rate, limits email fetch, cuts down on visual effects, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-858449" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/ios-16-beta-6-battery-percent-low-power.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Low Power Mode can be set to turn on at a certain battery percentage using Shortcuts, which is a handy way to have it automatically turn on when you need it, and it's the best option if you're someone who doesn't often remember to toggle on Low Power Mode.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> has quite a few built-in safety features that are designed to help keep you safe, and with New Year's Eve parties approaching, it may be worth a refresher on what your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can do and the options you can enable to protect yourself.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/FindMy-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-779341" /><br/>
<h2 id="stolen_device_protection">Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">Stolen Device Protection keeps</a> your data safe in case someone steals your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and also happens to know your passcode. Earlier this year, there were reports about thieves spying on a victim's passcode before stealing an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, giving them access to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain passwords, banking accounts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926120" /><br/>
With Stolen Device Protection, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication is required to view passwords in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Keychain, turn off Lost Mode, erase content and settings, use saved Safari payment methods, and apply for or view an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>. Authentication <em>and</em> an hour-long waiting period is required for changing an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> password, changing an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; passcode, removing &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;/&zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj;, and turning off &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Stolen Device Protection is actually an iOS 17.3 feature, so there are some extra steps to use it. You'll need to download and install the iOS 17.3 public beta <a href="https://beta.apple.com">from Apple's beta software website</a> and follow the instructions. It's a little bit of a hassle, but if you're going to be out in public and drinking, Stolen Device Protection is worth the effort just in case.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Note:</b> Apple does not recommend installing beta software on a primary device, and there is a chance that the install could cause issues with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. We have not seen reports of iOS 17.3 causing problems, but it is worth weighing the benefits and downsides before opting for a beta. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messages_check_in">Messages Check In</h2><br/>
If you're going out somewhere, you can use the Check In feature in Messages to let a trusted friend or family member know where you're going and when you should arrive.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/messages-check-in.jpg" alt="" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909078" /><br/>
When you head out, turn on Check In, and it will keep track of your progress. If you stop along the way, Messages will ping you to see what's going on, and if you do not respond, helpful information like your battery level, location, route traveled, location of last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; unlock, and cellular status will be shared with the trusted person.<br/>
<br/>
Check In is a feature that ensures someone is keeping an eye on you from afar, and if you're in an accident, accosted, or otherwise in trouble, it gives detailed information that can be used to find you.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="use_find_my">Use Find My</h2><br/>
You can also give a trusted friend or family member access to your location through the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app. Go to &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, choose the People tab, and tap Share My Location.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/find-my-friends-precision-finding.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1690" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911341" /><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; can be used to track down your friends in a crowd if you're in a place like a concert venue. Note that both people need to have an &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="medical_id">Medical ID</h2><br/>
Make sure your medical information is up to date in the Health app. Tap on your profile and then go to Medical ID to update your information.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iphone-medical-id.jpg" alt="" width="1316" height="740" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928279" /><br/>
This is a quick way for someone to see your name, age, allergies, and emergency contacts, and it's data that can be viewed when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="safety_check">Safety Check</h2><br/>
It's a good idea to use the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s Safety Check feature every now and then to see who you're sharing data with and who can track you. Open up the Settings app, go to Privacy and Security, scroll down, and tap on Safety Check.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/ios-16-manage-sharing-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1299" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856675" /><br/>
In an emergency, you can use the Emergency Reset option, but for a check up, you'll want to tap on Manage Sharing &amp; Access. It will show you who can see your location, which apps have access to your location data, who you share photo albums with, who you share notes with, all devices logged in to your &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="features_to_know_about">Features to Know About</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Emergency SOS</strong> - If you press and hold on the side button and either volume button on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, you can call emergency services surreptitiously. There's also an option to press five times on the side button to call, which is an even easier method. Adjust your SOS settings by going to Settings &gt; Emergency SOS.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Emergency SOS on Apple Watch</strong> - To contact emergency services on the Apple Watch, hold down the side button until the emergency call slider appears, and then drag it to make the call.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Crash Detection</strong> - Crash Detection contacts local emergency services if a crash is detected. It's on by default, but double check that it's enabled under Settings > Emergency SOS > Call After Severe Crash.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Satellite SOS</strong> - In a remote area where you don't have signal, you can use satellite connectivity to get help in an emergency. It's a feature available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and 15 models, and note that you will need to be outside and have a line of sight to the sky for the best connectivity.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Use Siri</strong> - You can ask <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> to call 911 (or your local emergency number).</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Text 911</strong> - Need to get help while staying quiet? You can text 911 in the United States by opening up the Messages app and typing 911 in the "To" field. This works on Apple Watch too.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, listening to YouTube audio in the background usually requires paying for a YouTube Premium subscription, but there is a simple workaround that allows you to keep listening to a video when you are doing other things on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or when your device is locked. Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/General-YouTube-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-814336" /><br/>
As YouTube has grown in popularity over the years, Google has opted to park several features of the video hosting service behind a paywall, such as ad-free viewing, SharePlay on iOS, and the ability to listen to YouTube audio on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when the app is closed.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, YouTube Premium costs &#36;13.99 a month to access these features. But if all you want to do is listen to YouTube-hosted audio like podcasts, music, or lectures when you are in other apps or when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is locked and in your pocket, there is a way to achieve this without paying for the subscription. <br/>
<br/>
The following steps show you how it's done. <br/>
<ol><li>Launch Safari on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube.com</a>, then search for the video whose audio you want to listen to.</li><br/>
<li>Next, tap the <strong>aA</strong> button in Safari's address bar, then select <strong>Request Desktop Website</strong> from the popup menu.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/youtube-safari.jpg" alt="safari" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927791" /><br/>
<li>Tap the play button or tap the video to begin playback, while ignoring or dismissing any popups encouraging you to open the YouTube mobile app. (You will need to watch or skip a few ads before video playback begins.)</li><br/>
<li>Now, lock your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with the device's <strong>Side</strong> button. The audio will pause, but you can just tap the <strong>Play</strong> button in the Lock Screen playback controls widget to resume listening. <br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/youtube-locked-iphone.jpg" alt="Lock Screen" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927792" /></ol>After following the above steps, the audio from YouTube will continue to play on your locked &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for as long as the video lasts, leaving you free to pocket your device and listen on headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/youtube-dynamic-island.jpg" alt="" width="1339" height="738" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927793" /><br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused/">staying the Apple Watch import ban</a>, Apple has returned the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra/49mm-cellular-titanium-white-ocean-band-onesize">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> to its online stores in the U.S., and they should also be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-available-in-stores-today/">available in some Apple retail stores</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/apple-watch-ultra-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-885160" /><br/>
Apple on Tuesday filed an emergency request asking for the import ban to be paused while an appeal is under way. The appeals court implemented an interim stay while it decides whether it will grant Apple's request for a stay for the entire length of the appeal, and as a result, Apple can once again sell Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing technology.<br/>
<br/>
The International Trade Commission (ITC) has until January 10 to file a response to Apple's request for a stay, and other parties have until January 15 to submit letters supporting or opposing the import ban. Apple should be able to continue to sell the watch at least until the appeals court makes a final ruling on the stay, which will happen at some point after January 15.<br/>
<br/>
If the appeals court rules in Apple's favor, the import ban on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and Ultra 2 will be paused for the entire duration of the appeals process. If the court does not rule in Apple's favor, the import ban will be reinstated. The appeals process could last for many months, so Apple may get a significant reprieve as it argues against the ITC's decision.<br/>
<br/>
The ITC in October decided that Apple had infringed on blood oxygen sensing technology patented by Masimo, and put in place a U.S. import ban that went into effect on December 26. In preparation for the ban, Apple actually <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/">stopped sales online</a> on December 21, and ended in-store sales after December 24.<br/>
<br/>
The Biden administration had the opportunity to veto the import ban, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/26/apple-watch-import-ban-official/">opted not to do so</a>, making the import ban official. To get around the Apple Watch legal issues, Apple will need to win its appeal against Masimo, settle with Masimo, or remove the infringing blood oxygen sensing technology from the Apple Watch lineup.<br/>
<br/>
The import ban only affected &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> models sold in Apple retail stores and the online store in the United States. Sales in other countries have not been affected, and the Apple Watch models have continued to be available in the U.S. in stores like Target, Walmart, and Best Buy.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/itc/">ITC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/">Patent Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/">Masimo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-online/">Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 Once Again Available to Purchase From Apple&#039;s Online Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-once-again-available-to-purchase-from-apples-online-store.2414879/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[2024 is just a few days away, and there are many iOS 17 and iOS 18 features that are expected to launch throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912514" /><br/>
Below, we have recapped new iOS features expected in 2024, including Stolen Device Protection, collaborative Apple Music playlists, AirPlay on hotel room TVs, app sideloading in the EU, next-generation CarPlay, roadside assistance via satellite outside of the U.S., RCS support in the Messages app, and generative AI for Siri.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926120" /><br/>
Earlier this year, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/19/apple-responds-to-iphone-theft-recovery-key-report/">thieves spying on an iPhone user's passcode</a> before stealing the device, often in public places like bars. With knowledge of the passcode, the thief can then change the victim's Apple ID password, turn off Find My, and more to gain full control of the device. The thief can also use the passcode to gain access to passwords stored in iCloud Keychain and other sensitive information.<br/>
<br/>
Stolen Device Protection is Apple's hopeful solution to the problem. Apple says the feature is designed to add an additional layer of security in the event someone has stolen your iPhone and also obtained the device's passcode.<br/>
<br/>
When the feature is turned on, Face ID or Touch ID authentication is strictly required for the following actions, with a passcode fallback no longer available:<ul><li>Accessing passwords or passkeys saved in iCloud Keychain</li><br/>
<li>Applying for a new Apple Card or viewing an Apple Card's virtual number</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Lost Mode</li><br/>
<li>Erasing all content and settings</li><br/>
<li>Taking certain Apple Cash and Apple Card Savings actions in the Wallet app</li><br/>
<li>Using payment methods saved in Safari</li><br/>
<li>Using your iPhone to set up a new device</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
For especially sensitive actions, including changing the password of the Apple ID account associated with the iPhone, the feature adds a one-hour security delay on top of biometric authentication. In these cases, the user must authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, wait one hour, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again. However, Apple says there is no delay when the iPhone is in familiar locations, such as at home or work.<br/>
<br/>
Actions that require Face ID or Touch ID authentication, and have a one-hour security delay, when the feature is turned on:<ul><li>Changing your Apple ID password</li><br/>
<li>Updating select Apple ID security settings, including adding or removing a trusted device, trusted phone number, Recovery Key, or Recovery Contact</li><br/>
<li>Changing your iPhone passcode</li><br/>
<li>Adding or removing Face ID or Touch ID</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Find My</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Stolen Device Protection</li></ul>Stolen Device Protection is an opt-in feature that can be found in the Settings app under Face ID & Passcode, and it is available for all iPhones that are compatible with iOS 17. iPhone users who update to the iOS 17.3 beta are able to preview the feature.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to share additional information about the feature once iOS 17.3 is released widely.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Music Collaborative Playlists</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-music-collaborative-playlist.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898803" /><br/>
A new Collaborative Playlists option for Apple Music subscribers allows multiple people to add, reorder, and remove songs in a shared playlist. Users are able to leave <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/ios-17-3-collaborative-playlist-emoji/">animated emoji reactions</a> next to songs in the playlist.<br/>
<br/>
This feature was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/">initially expected to launch with iOS 17.2</a>, but it was removed from that update towards the end of the beta testing period. The feature was re-added in iOS 17.3, and Apple's website confirms that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">will return in 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPlay on Hotel Room TVs</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airplay-hotels.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898340" /><br/>
Following the release of iOS 17.2, Apple updated its website to indicate that an AirPlay feature for hotel room TVs has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-delays-airplay-in-hotel-rooms/">delayed until next year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple originally said the feature was "coming later this year," but it now says it will be "coming in an update in 2024." Apple did not provide a more specific timeframe, but the feature should be added in an iOS 17 update in the first half of next year.<br/>
<br/>
The feature will allow iPhone users to scan a QR code on their hotel room TV to establish an AirPlay connection, allowing them to wirelessly stream videos, photos, and music from their iPhone to the TV. Google already offers a similar feature on some hotel TVs, allowing guests to stream content from their smartphone via Chromecast.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in June said Holiday Inn parent company IHG Hotels & Resorts would be one of the first hotel chains to adopt the feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Sideloading in EU</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last year reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/13/apple-europe-alternate-app-store-support/">preparing to allow app sideloading on the iPhone</a> in order to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act. This would allow users to install apps outside of Apple's App Store, but the change is only expected to be made in European Union countries, at least initially.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman recently said that he expects app sideloading in the EU to roll out in an iOS 17 update released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/eu-iphone-app-sideloading-coming-2024/">in the first half of 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927534" /><br/>
Apple said that the first vehicles with support for its next-generation CarPlay system would be announced in late 2023, and it delivered on that promise with just days to spare. Earlier this month, Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed what the next-generation CarPlay experience will look like</a> in some of their upcoming vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
Aston Martin confirmed that it will release its first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay in 2024, but there is no specific timeframe, and details remain slim.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first previewed the next-generation CarPlay experience in June 2022, promising deeper integration with the instrument cluster and climate controls, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, a dedicated FM radio app, widgets, and more. The interface can be tailored to each specific vehicle model and automaker's brand identity.<br/>
<br/>
When first unveiling next-generation CarPlay last year, Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Beyond the addition of Aston Martin, it's unclear if this list has changed since that initial announcement.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Roadside Assistance via Satellite Outside U.S.</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-roadside-assistance.jpg" alt="" width="1596" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910510" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 17, all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models offer a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-roadside-assistance-feature-tested/">roadside assistance via satellite feature</a> that allows users in the U.S. to contact roadside assistance company AAA for vehicle service when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said the feature is available "beginning" in the U.S., so it will likely expand to some additional countries starting in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November, Apple announced that it will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later next year," so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li><br/>
 <li>Improved encryption compared to SMS</li><br/>
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smarter Siri</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">iOS 18 to feature generative AI technology</a> that "should improve how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences." He said Apple has also explored generative AI features for other apps across its platforms, including Apple Music, Pages, Keynote, and Xcode.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em> reported that Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">incorporate large language models into Siri</a> to let users automate complex tasks, a feature that would involve deeper integration with the Shortcuts app. The report said this feature is expected to be released in an iPhone software update coming next year, which would likely be iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity last year when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts. Google and Microsoft released similar chatbots earlier this year, as more companies race into the space. The chatbots are trained on large language models, allowing them to respond like a human.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/new-ios-features-launching-in-2024/">New iOS Features Coming in 2024 for Messages, Apple Music, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ios-features-coming-in-2024-for-messages-apple-music-and-more.2414878/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Inverse</em>'s Raymond Wong today published an in-depth <a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/mac-gaming-apple-silicon-interview">overview of Apple's increasing push towards high-end gaming on the Mac</a>. The story includes commentary from Apple marketing managers Gordon Keppel and Leland Martin.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Mac-Gaming.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899793" /><br/>
One of the biggest reasons that gaming has improved on the Mac in recent years is the switch from Intel processors to Apple silicon, resulting in MacBooks providing industry-leading performance-per-watt. In addition, the latest M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips for the Mac feature hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading for improved graphics rendering, which is especially beneficial for high-end AAA games.<br/>
<br/>
"Now, every Mac that ships with Apple silicon can play AAA games pretty fantastically," said Keppel. "Apple silicon has been transformative of our mainstream systems that got tremendous boosts in graphics with M1, M2, and now with M3."<br/>
<br/>
Apple silicon also results in the Mac having the same underlying hardware architecture as the iPhone and iPad, simplifying the development process.<br/>
<br/>
"If you look at the Mac lineup just a few years ago, there was a mix of both integrated and discrete GPUs," said Martin. "That can add complexity when you're developing games. Because you have multiple different hardware permutations to consider. Today, we've effectively eliminated that completely with Apple silicon, creating a unified gaming platform now across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Once a game is designed for one platform, it's a straightforward process to bring it to the other two. We're seeing this play out with games like Resident Evil Village that launched first [on Mac] followed by iPhone and iPad."<br/>
<br/>
A new technology built into the M3 family of chips is Dynamic Caching, which allows the GPU to allocate memory usage in real time. Apple says this capability "dramatically increases GPU utilization and performance" for demanding apps and games.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has made gaming-related improvements on the software side, too. macOS Sonoma <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/macos-14-game-mode/">features a new Game Mode</a> that temporarily prioritizes CPU and GPU performance for gaming. Game Mode also lowers AirPods audio latency, and reduces input latency with popular third-party game controllers by doubling the Bluetooth sampling rate.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/10/apple-releases-mac-game-porting-toolkit/">released a new toolkit</a> that makes it easier for game developers to port Windows games to the Mac. The toolkit provides an emulation environment that allows developers to run their existing, unmodified Windows game on the Mac and quickly evaluate how well the game could run on macOS before writing any code.<br/>
<br/>
"We've definitely seen interest from developers and publishers like Kojima Productions and Annapurna Interactive Games on how to take advantage of both parts of the Game Porting Toolkit," Martin said. "When you download the toolkit, there's really two parts to it. There's that emulation environment and that's helped demonstrate today's game — you drop in an existing Windows game and see how well it could run on the Mac. The second part is the Metal shader converter and that's there to help developers convert their tens of thousands of shader code into Metal. And they've praised how incredibly useful this is and how it's saved them a bunch of time in their development timeline."<br/>
<br/>
Several high-profile games launched on the Mac this year, including a <em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, <em>Stray</em>, and <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>. <em>Death Stranding Director's Cut</em> and <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> are also expected to launch on the Mac next year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's second-generation Vision Pro headset will feature more advanced micro-OLED displays that offer higher brightness and improved efficiency, according to market research firm Omdia (via <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=24943"><em>The Elec</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-lenses.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898584" /><br/>
Apple is reportedly planning to upgrade the Vision Pro to an RGB OLEDoS display in 2027, a notable improvement over the WOLED with color filter used in the first-generation model. RGB OLEDoS technology produces light and color directly from nearby RGB sub-pixels on a single layer, putting an end to the need for a color filter.<br/>
<br/>
This results in significantly higher brightness compared to WOLED and color filter OLEDoS displays, which depend on filtering white light through an RGB color layer. It is also markedly more efficient than WOLED and color filter technology.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung is currently the only company capable of supplying RGB OLEDoS displays following its acquisition of eMagin earlier this year, with the company likely set to take over from Sony in Apple's supply chain if it proceeds with the upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, like Omdia, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/">previously mentioned</a> a 2027 launch time frame for the second-generation Vision Pro headset. He said that it is possible there will be no hardware updates for the Vision Pro until then. There have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/work-on-multiple-next-gen-vision-pro-headsets/">several reports</a> of Apple planning to launch a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/vision-pro-2-focusing-on-size-weight-lenses/">lower-cost headset</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/12/cheaper-apple-vision-headset-2025/">as soon as 2025</a>, but there is some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/">skepticism</a> about whether these plans are still in place.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models concurrently, which is why we sometimes get rumored feature leaks so far ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different, and already we have some idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-17-Five-Features-Header.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927358" /><br/>
If you plan to skip next year's iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious, here are five rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for its successor, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released in September 2025.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    1. Larger Standard Devices</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
Next year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-taller-aspect-ratio/">rumored</a> to be getting bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. With the ‌iPhone‌ 17 and ‌iPhone‌ 17 Plus in 2025, Apple is expected to also bring the larger 6.27- and 6.86-inch display sizes to its two standard ‌iPhone‌ models. As a result, expect the entire iPhone 17 lineup to use a taller aspect ratio of 19.6:9, suggesting the devices will be slightly taller, rather than wider. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    2. 120Hz ProMotion (Always-on Display)</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple intends to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/">expand</a> ProMotion to its standard models in 2025, allowing them to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Plus to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">3. Under-Display Face ID</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">expected</a> to be the first ‌iPhone‌ to feature under-panel Face ID technology. The only external indication of the under-display ‌Face ID‌ technology will likely be a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. This will probably be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple is then <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-under-display-camera/">expected</a> adopt under-display cameras in 2027's "Pro" ‌iPhone‌ models for a true "all-screen" appearance.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">4. Apple-Designed Wi-Fi 7 Chip</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's premium models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-apple-wifi-7-chip-rumor/">expected</a> to be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip for the first time. Wi-Fi 7 support would allow the "Pro" models to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. The Wi-Fi chip would also allow Apple to further reduce its dependance on external suppliers like Broadcom, which currently supplies Apple with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">5. 48MP Telephoto Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
An upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto lens on Apple's largest premium device is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/">expected</a> to be optimized for use with Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset, set to be released in the U.S. in early 2024. (The current iPhone 15 Pro models feature 48-megapixel main, 12-megapixel ultra wide, and 12-megapixel telephoto lenses.) That would make 2025's "Pro Max" the first iPhone to have a rear camera system composed entirely of 48-megapixel lenses, making it capable of capturing even more photographic detail.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/iphone-17-five-rumored-features-2025/">iPhone 17: Five Features Apple Plans to Save for 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-five-features-apple-plans-to-save-for-2025.2414853/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[2023 was a relatively iterative year for Apple product releases, but there were still many notable announcements and surprises throughout the year. Apple previewed its upcoming Vision Pro headset, the full-sized HomePod made a comeback, the iPhone finally switched to USB-C, leather accessories were discontinued, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Apple-in-2023-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928075" /><br/>
Below, we recap some of the most noteworthy Apple news stories of 2023, in no particular order.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Behold the Vision Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-WWCD23-Vision-Pro-EyeSight-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922614" /><br/>
After several years of rumors about Apple planning an augmented reality/virtual reality headset, the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-reveals-vision-pro-headset/">officially unveiled the Vision Pro</a> in June. Apple says the headset will be available in the U.S. starting in early 2024, with pricing set at a staggering &#36;3,499.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro will allow you to interact with apps as if they are floating in the air. The headset is powered by an all-new operating system called visionOS, and it can be controlled with your eyes and hands. It has an Apple Watch-like Digital Crown for switching between virtual reality and augmented reality, and it is powered by an external battery pack.<br/>
<br/>
Read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Vision Pro roundup</a> for more details about the headset.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Return of the HomePod</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-White-and-Midnight-Feature-Purple-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881772" /><br/>
The full-sized HomePod made a comeback this year, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-announces-new-homepod/">Apple announced a new model</a> in January.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation HomePod features a virtually identical design as the full-sized model that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/">discontinued in 2021</a>. However, it has two fewer tweeters and two fewer microphones compared to the original model, and it has an added sensor that can measure temperature and humidity in indoor environments. Many early reviews of the latest HomePod said it has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/homepod/">very similar sound quality</a> as the original model. <br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., the HomePod is priced at &#36;299, with white and midnight color options available.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Goes USB-C — Finally!</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
It finally happened. After years of hopes and rumors, all iPhone 15 models are equipped with a USB-C port instead of Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
While the USB-C port on iPhones is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-usb-c-port-completely-standard/">completely standard</a>, only the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/16/iphone-15-usb-c-port-details/">support USB 3.2</a> data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps. The lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-usb-port-limited-to-lightning-speeds/">limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds</a> of up to 480 Mbps, which is equal to Lightning speeds on previous iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
All iPhone 15 models can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-usb-c-port-apple-watch-airpods-charging/">charge an Apple Watch, AirPods case, and other small accessories</a> connected to the USB-C port, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/all-iphone-15-models-support-displayport/">support DisplayPort for up to 4K HDR video mirroring and video output</a> to an external display or TV.<br/>
<br/>
Apple still sells a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/remaining-apple-products-with-lightning/">handful of devices and accessories with Lightning ports</a>, all of which will likely be updated with USB-C or discontinued in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Green Bubble Dreams</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November, Apple announced that it will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later next year." Based on that timeframe, RCS support will likely be added as part of iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li><br/>
 <li>Improved encryption compared to SMS</li><br/>
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
Google had been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/02/google-again-pushes-apple-to-adopt-rcs/">urging Apple to adopt RCS</a> for a few years.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>All the Apple Wallet News</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892213" /><br/>
2023 was a big year for the Apple Wallet app on the iPhone, as several new features launched, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">Apple Card savings account</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-pay-later-launches/">Apple Pay Later financing option</a>, and more. However, it wasn't all good news on this front, as it was reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">Apple Card's financial partner Goldman Sachs will be out</a> in the next year or so.<br/>
<br/>

During its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">Halloween-themed "Scary Fast" event</a> in October, Apple announced the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro all at once, rather than holding the Pro and Max chips for a later time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple updated the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, and there is also an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M3 chip. Other new features for the laptops include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/">Space Black finish</a> for M3 Pro and M3 Max configurations, and 20% brighter displays for standard content.<br/>

<h2>Goodbye Leather, Hello FineWoven</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-FineWoven.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913676" /><br/>
As part of its efforts to be environmentally friendly, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">discontinued all of its leather accessories</a> this year, including iPhone cases, Apple Watch bands, AirTag holders, the MagSafe Wallet, and more. Apple unveiled a new FineWoven material as a replacement for leather, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/">customers complained about quality issues</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Jessica Nix referred to FineWoven as Apple's "<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-25/apple-s-finewoven-fabric-emerges-as-its-biggest-misfire-of-2023">biggest dud of 2023</a>."<br/>

<h2>Final Cut Pro for iPad</h2><br/>

YouTubers rejoiced this year when Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/23/apple-releases-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-for-ipad/">expanded its video creation app Final Cut Pro to the iPad</a>. The app was previously only available on the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says Final Cut Pro for the iPad is optimized for the device's touch-first interface, providing the "ultimate mobile studio for video and music creators." The app is priced at &#36;4.99 per month or &#36;49 per year in the U.S., after a one-month free trial, and it is compatible with iPad models equipped with the M1 chip or newer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also released its music creation app Logic Pro for the iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay Teaser</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927534" /><br/>
Apple said that the first vehicles with support for its next-generation CarPlay system would be announced in late 2023, and it delivered on that promise with just days to spare. Earlier this month, Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed what the next-generation CarPlay experience will look like</a> in some of their upcoming vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
Aston Martin confirmed that it will release its first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay in 2024, but there is no specific timeframe and details remain slim.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first previewed the next-generation CarPlay experience in June 2022, promising deeper integration with the instrument cluster and climate controls, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, a dedicated FM radio app, widgets, and more. The interface can be tailored to each specific vehicle model and automaker's brand identity.<br/>
<br/>
When first unveiling next-generation CarPlay last year, Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Beyond the addition of Aston Martin, it's unclear if this list has changed since that initial announcement.<br/>

<h2>Apple Watch Sales Ban</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-watch-series-6-blood-oxygen-monitoring-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-759072" /><br/>
Earlier this month, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-pausing-series-9-ultra-2-sales-in-us/">paused sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the U.S.</a> due to a patent dispute with medical tech company Masimo, which has accused Apple of poaching its employees and stealing trade secrets in order to develop the blood oxygen sensing feature available on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer.<br/>
<br/>
In January, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that Apple had infringed on a Masimo patent related to blood oxygen sensing, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/us-trade-tribunal-apple-watch-ban-masimo/">ordered an import and sales ban</a> for Apple Watch models offering the feature. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/26/apple-watch-import-ban-official/">Apple appealed the decision</a> in court and was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused/">granted a temporary stay</a>, so the ban is lifted for now.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/the-biggest-apple-news-stories-of-2023/">Apple in 2023: The Biggest News Stories and Surprises of the Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-in-2023-the-biggest-news-stories-and-surprises-of-the-year.2414830/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> are back in some of Apple's retail stores in the United States today, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1740133644835164569"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Select stores will have availability today, while all stores will have the Apple Watch models back in stock by December 30. Online sales of the devices are set to resume tomorrow by 12:00 p.m. Pacific Time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
Apple is able to begin selling the Apple Watch models again after the U.S. Court of Appeals temporarily paused the import ban levied by the U.S. International Trade Commission. It's likely that Apple will be able to sell the Apple Watch models through most of January, and perhaps longer depending on what the court decides.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused/">import ban has been halted</a> while the appeals court determines whether a longer pause should be implemented while the full ITC vs. Apple appeal plays out. If that happens, the import ban will be stayed for several months, but if the appeals court decides not to stay the ban during the appeals process, Apple will need to stop sales again.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. ITC has until January 10 to argue its case for the import ban to restart immediately, and the appeals court is accepting letters supporting or opposing the import ban through January 15. After that, the court will make a final ruling on the stay.<br/>
<br/>
Apple paused &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and Ultra 2 sales <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/">online on December 21</a> and in stores after December 24 to comply with an ITC ruling. The ITC banned imports of Apple Watch components related to blood oxygen monitoring technology after it decided the Apple Watch infringes on patents owned by medical device company Masimo.<br/>
<br/>
The temporary stay on the ban not only allows Apple to resume sales for now, but it also gives Apple time to provide adequate stock to third-party retailers in case the ban is reinstated. Apple retail stores in the United States will have to stop selling the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and Ultra 2 if that happens, but the ban does not extend to retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Target.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/itc/">ITC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/">Patent Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/">Masimo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-available-in-stores-today/">Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 Available in Apple Stores Starting Today, Online Sales to Resume Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-available-in-apple-stores-starting-today-online-sales-to-resume-tomorrow.2414825/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a collection of deals on Apple accessories, many of which are at all-time low prices this week. This includes AirTag, MagSafe Charger, Apple Pencil 2, MagSafe Duo Charger, and the Pro Display XDR. All of these deals can be found on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/magsafe-xmas.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923177" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Highlights include the AirTag at &#36;23.99 (&#36;6 off) and AirTag 4-Pack at &#36;78.99 (&#36;20 off), both of which are just a few dollars away from their previous all-time low prices and are the best prices we've tracked during the holiday season.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0933BVK6T%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;6 OFF</div>AirTag 1 Pack for &#36;23.99</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
For MagSafe products, there's the MagSafe Charger at &#36;29.00 (&#36;10 off) and MagSafe Duo Charger at &#36;98.50 (&#36;30 off). These are also just a few dollars short of their record low prices, and certainly the best deals you'll find for the remainder of 2023.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08L5NP6NG%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;10 OFF</div>MagSafe Charger for &#36;29.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Lastly, Amazon has the Apple Pencil 2 at &#36;89.00 (&#36;40 off) and there's also a record low price on the Pro Display XDR (Standard Glass), priced at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB082LZTDX5%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;4,399.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;4,999.00.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/26/apple-watch-import-ban-official/">ban on imports</a> of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> models has today been temporarily paused, meaning that the devices can now go back on sale for a short while longer in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
Apple filed an emergency request to the United States Court of Appeals following President Biden's decision to decline a veto on the sales ban, allowing it to take effect earlier this week. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cafc.21094/gov.uscourts.cafc.21094.19.0_1.pdf">today accepted</a> an interim stay while the court reviews Apple's request for a full stay for the length of the appeal, effectively pausing the ban on Apple Watch imports for a brief period. <br/>
<br/>
The International Trade Commission (ITC) now has until January 10 to file its response to Apple's request for a full stay while the appeal plays out. The ITC initiated proceedings against Apple after Masimo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/masimo-ceo-on-apple-watch-ban/">accuses Apple</a> of hiring away its employees to steal technology related to blood oxygen monitoring in the Apple Watch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/">Masimo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused/">Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 Sales Ban Paused by US Appeals Court</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused-by-us-appeals-court.2414792/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is continuing work on a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> model that features a curved LCD display, according to the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/homepod-b720.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928024" /><br/>
The device, codenamed B720, apparently features the same design as the current &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; but with a curved, convex LCD screen at the top to display content.<br/>
<br/>
In October, Kosutami shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/21/images-show-new-homepod-with-screen/">images of component parts</a> that allegedly belong to a prototype touch screen &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;. Other reports at the time claimed to verify the legitimacy of these images with other sources.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">More details on HomePod B720<br>Same panel size and same design with HomePod 2.

<br/>
Apple is believed to be working to adapt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> to be compatible with the new display, which will show a blurred animation based on the colors of the album art when a song or podcast is playing. The screen could also potentially show important notifications. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> was first to suggest in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/">2021</a> that Apple is working on new HomePods with displays and cameras. Earlier this year, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> claimed Apple plans to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">redesigned HomePod with a 7-inch display</a> in the first half of 2024. <br/>
<br/>
In the long term, Apple is believed to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/08/apple-engineers-pessimistic-apple-tv-strategy/">rethinking its smart home strategy</a>, and is working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-in-development/">combined Apple TV and HomePod device</a>, as well as a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/">screen mounted on a robotic arm</a>, according to a Gurman.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/future-homepod-to-add-curved-lcd-display/">Future HomePod Again Rumored to Add Curved LCD Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/future-homepod-again-rumored-to-add-curved-lcd-display.2414776/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Health technology company AliveCor has praised the International Trade Commission (ITC)'s ban on sales of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-watch-ecg-wrist.jpg" alt="" width="1119" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-781502" /><br/>
AliveCor, like Masimo, accuses Apple of violating its patents related to heath technology used in the Apple Watch. While Masimo's fight focuses on the Apple Watch's blood oxygen sensing capabilities, AliveCor contends that Apple is in breach of patent with its ECG technology.<br/>
<br/>
AliveCor demonstrated a prototype Apple Watch band with a built-in ECG sensor to Apple in 2015. Apple then unveiled its own built-in ECG technology in 2018 with the Apple Watch Series 4, leading AliveCor to argue that Apple had stolen its technology and request that the ITC bans Apple Watch sales in the United States. AliveCor also initiated an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/alivecor-apple-watch-antitrust-lawsuit/">antitrust lawsuit</a> against Apple, alleging that it was making it needlessly difficult for third-party apps to access the Apple Watch's heart rate data.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/12/26/alivecor-apple-watch-ban-patents/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>, AliveCor expressed its support for Masimo and praised the move to ban Apple Watch sales:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>This is the second time in less than 12 months President Biden has allowed an International Trade Commission Limited Exclusion Order (LEO) to stand against imports of Apple Watches that violate the patents of small U.S. innovators. Earlier this year, AliveCor's patent for its FDA-cleared personal electrocardiogram (ECG) technology was similarly affirmed and we share our support today for Masimo's tenacity in its face off with Apple. Innovator companies and health consumers alike should be encouraged that industry giants are increasingly being held accountable for anticompetitive practices that would ultimately limit access to potentially life-saving technology.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The ITC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/22/biden-admin-upholds-apple-watch-patent-ruling/">ruled in favor of AliveCor</a>'s patent infringement claims, but the case did not result in a ban on Apple Watch sales as AliveCor hoped. Unlike AliveCor, Masimo argues that Apple actively hired its engineers and key executives to steal technology. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alivecor/">AliveCor</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/">Masimo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/alivecor-praises-apple-watch-ban/">AliveCor Praises Apple Watch Ban Amid Its Own Health Tech Patent Dispute With Apple</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alivecor-praises-apple-watch-ban-amid-its-own-health-tech-patent-dispute-with-apple.2414774/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Video will introduce limited ads to its content starting on January 29, offering an ad-free option for an additional fee.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/prime-video-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928010" /><br/>
In an email to subscribers, Amazon confirmed that movies and TV shows on Prime Video will soon feature "limited advertisements" starting on January 29, 2024. The company assured users that Prime Video will have "meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers."<br/>
<br/>
The current price of Amazon Prime subscriptions will not change, but members who prefer to avoid ads can opt for a new ad-free version at an extra cost of &#36;2.99 per month. Amazon's email to subscribers reads:<blockquote>Dear Prime member, <br/>
<br/>
We are writing to you today about an upcoming change to your Prime Video experience. Starting January 29, Prime Video movies and TV shows will include limited advertisements. This will allow us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. No action is required from you, and there is no change to the current price of your Prime membership. We will also offer a new ad-free option for an additional &#36;2.99 per month...</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Amazon already operates Freevee, a free, ad-supported streaming service. Competitor streaming services like Disney+, Hulu, and Netflix have also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/netflix-ad-plan-apple-tv/">introduced ad-supported options</a> amid rising subscription costs.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[An official <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> cover has emerged in new design patent filings from Hong Kong, revealing the first-party headset accessory for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/vision-pro-case.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928003" /><br/>
Apple was granted 70 more design patents in Hong Kong related to its Vision Pro headset on Friday, December 22. The filings, first spotted by <em><a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/2023/12/apple-has-won-another-70-design-patents-for-apple-vision-pro-including-one-for-a-new-headset-cover-a-new-magsafe-battery.html">PatentlyApple</a></em>, include a never-before-seen Vision Pro accessory with a range of accompanying images showing various angles of it.<br/>
<br/>
The accessory's design seems to match the Vision Pro's headband, using a soft-touch woven fabric to cover the entire front and sides of the headset. It does not cover the back of the headset or Light Seal in any way, likely being designed to help protect the headset's EyeSight display from scratches and other damage. The cover also features a tab on the left-hand side to help remove it from the headset easily.<br/>
<br/>
The other notable design patent won by Apple in the latest batch of filings is a Vision Pro battery, incorrectly identified by some websites as a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> battery pack, showing a recessed port. This is worth highlighting as it confirms that the battery unit's cable is removable.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/official-vision-pro-cover-accessory-emerges/">Official Vision Pro Cover Accessory Emerges in New Apple Design Patent</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/official-vision-pro-cover-accessory-emerges-in-new-apple-design-patent.2414768/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Japan is preparing antitrust legislation to force Apple to allow app sideloading and alternative payment methods for in-app purchases, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-crack-down-on-Apple-and-Google-app-store-monopolies"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833991" /><br/>
The plans by Japan's Fair Trade Commission focus on combating Apple and Google's dominance in app stores and payments, search, browsers, and operating systems. The regulation could encompass a wide range of changes to Apple's practices, such as an obligation to allow users to utilize alternative app stores, effectively allowing sideloading on iPhones and iPads in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
The regulation also looks to impose fines for violations of the rules amounting to around six percent of revenue earned from "problematic activities." The Fair Trade Commission's work on the legislation is ongoing, with plans to finalize it in the spring. The legislation will have to be approved by parliament in 2024 before coming into effect.<br/>
<br/>
Japan's proposed regulation bears a strong resemblance to the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">set to force Apple</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/">enable app sideloading</a> in the EU by March 2024 among other significant changes.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/japan/">Japan</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/japan-preparing-eu-style-law/">Japan Preparing EU-Style Law to Force Apple to Allow App Sideloading and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/japan-preparing-eu-style-law-to-force-apple-to-allow-app-sideloading-and-more.2414767/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's vice president of product design Tang Tan is set to join Sir Jony Ive's LoveFrom to design hardware products for OpenAI, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-26/apple-iphone-design-head-tang-tan-to-work-with-jony-ive-sam-altman-on-ai-tech"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/chatgpt-for-iphone-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-896306" /><br/>
Tan will become the latest Apple designer to join LoveFrom, a design company founded by Jony Ive after he departed Apple in 2019. A total of 14 members of Ive's former design team at Apple have now left the company. Only around six designers who once reported to Ive still remain at Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Ive took more Apple designers with him to LoveFrom than remain at Apple. To date, more than 20 former Apple employees have joined Ive's new design firm, including Marc Newson and Shota Aoyagi.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> says that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/jony-ive-iphone-artificial-intelligence-openai/">Ive's work for OpenAI</a> marks one of his "most ambitious efforts" since he left Apple, and he apparently hopes to turn the work into a new company, with current efforts focused on hiring talent and creating concepts.<br/>
<br/>
At Apple, Tang Tan is vice president of product design and reports to senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus. Tan is responsible for the design of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple Watch, accessories, and acoustic devices like AirPods. News of his departure emerged <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/iphone-product-design-vp-leaves-apple/">earlier this month</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Tan will lead hardware engineering on the OpenAI project while working at LoveFrom. Little is known about OpenAI's hardware ambitions, but <em>Bloomberg</em> claims that projects in the concept stage include devices for the home. Tan officially departs Apple in February, but his responsibilities have already been divided up among successors.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/">Jony Ive</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lovefrom/">LoveFrom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/another-apple-designer-to-work-on-openai-hardware/">Another Apple Designer Joins Jony Ive to Work on Hardware for OpenAI</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/another-apple-designer-joins-jony-ive-to-work-on-hardware-for-openai.2414765/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In celebration of the Japanese New Year, Apple will be <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/shop/gifts/new-year">holding a promotion</a> that offers customers in Japan a free Apple gift card worth up to ¥30,000 with the purchase of an eligible Apple product from January 2 through January 5.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Japanese-New-Year-Apple-2024.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927987" /><br/>
Gift card values range from ¥4,000 for products like the iPhone SE and third-generation AirPods to ¥30,000 for the 15-inch MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to a gift card, the first 50,000 customers in Japan who purchase a new iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 13, or third-generation iPhone SE from Apple during the promotion will receive a limited-edition AirTag with a "Year of the Dragon" engraving.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has shared <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/shop/gifts/new-year/terms-conditions">terms and conditions</a> for the promotion with additional details. Notably, iPhone orders placed through the Apple Store app will not qualify for a limited-edition AirTag, so make sure to complete your purchase on Apple's website or at a physical Apple Store in Japan if you are interested in receiving one.<br/>
