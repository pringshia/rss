		<description><![CDATA[As of iOS 18.3, T-Mobile subscribers with a compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Starlink beta access are able to connect to Starlink satellites, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/apple-and-spacex-link-up-to-support-starlink-satellite-network-on-iphones">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple quietly worked with SpaceX and T-Mobile to add support for Starlink to its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup, and T-Mobile's website <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/coverage/satellite-support">confirms the new integration</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/tmobile-starlink.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="708" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987576" /><br/>
T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/t-mobile-takes-coverage-above-and-beyond-with-spacex">announced a partnership</a> with Starlink in 2022, and in December 2024, the carrier <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-starlink-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">opened up a beta program</a> allowing subscribers to use Starlink satellites for texting in areas without cell towers. At the time, the T-Mobile Starlink beta program was limited to Samsung smartphones, and iPhones weren't supported.<br/>
<br/>
Following the release of iOS 18.3, T-Mobile has invited a small number of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to take advantage of the Starlink beta, and those users have a new toggle to enable the satellite connectivity feature. T-Mobile customers who were selected received the following message:<br/>
<blockquote>You're in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.</blockquote><br/>
With Starlink integration, a T-Mobile &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without T-Mobile cellular service available will be able to pair automatically with Starlink satellites for connectivity. Starlink is limited to texting at the current time, but T-Mobile and SpaceX plan to support data and voice in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not respond to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s request for comment on the feature, but T-Mobile said that Starlink connectivity will eventually be available on the "vast majority of modern smartphones."<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and later already support satellite connectivity for text messages through Apple's partnership with Globalstar, so &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who are able to use Starlink can also opt to text with Apple's built-in satellite service. Both Apple's service and Starlink are only available when there is no nearby cellular network.<br/>
<br/>
Starlink beta access is limited right now, but T-Mobile eventually plans to expand the beta test to additional subscribers. T-Mobile customers can <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">sign up to join the beta</a> on the T-Mobile website. Starlink is only available in the U.S., and it is free during T-Mobile's beta testing period.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/ios-18-3-starlink-t-mobile-support/">iOS 18.3 Adds Starlink Support to T-Mobile iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-3-adds-starlink-support-to-t-mobile-iphones.2448308/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> 4 will feature a notch instead of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, respected display analyst Ross Young <a href="https://x.com/dsccross/status/1884326503393214966?s=46">said today</a>. The device will have a "notch like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>," according to Young, which contradicts a recent leak that depicted a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
Earlier this month, leaker Evan Blass <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/iphone-se-dynamic-island-rumor/">shared images</a> said to feature the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4's design, but those images featured an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; rather than the notch that had been previously rumored for new low-cost &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/iphone-se-dynamic-island-rumor/">sketchy leak</a> from February 2024 also suggested that the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 would get the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, but most other information has suggested that Apple will go with the notch design.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple rumors have indicated that the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is modeled after the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, and will therefore have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14-style design. The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; had a notch and not a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, so the notch makes more sense if Apple is using an &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; body for the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4. Alleged screen protectors for the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 also appear to have a design for a notch rather than the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>

With the launch of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4, Apple will sunset <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup, and all iPhones will have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>. The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is also expected to feature a 6.1-inch display, a single-lens rear camera, 8GB RAM, and an A17 Pro chip capable of supporting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Current rumors suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will be introduced in the spring, likely in April.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/iphone-se-4-notch/">iPhone SE 4 to Have Notch Instead of Dynamic Island</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-to-have-notch-instead-of-dynamic-island.2448296/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung just recently announced the Galaxy S25 Ultra, its latest flagship smartphone that's designed to compete with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. We did a hands-on video last week, but this week we're back with an in-depth camera comparison.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LFg5jV5jDF8" title="Blind Camera Test: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs iPhone 16 Pro Max" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
In this article and our accompanying video, we've included blind photos from the S25 Ultra and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max so you can judge for yourself which smartphone camera you prefer, but we'll let you know which is which at the very end of the video.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987522" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max has a 50-megapixel Main lens (which is wide angle), a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, and a 12-megapixel Telephoto lens. In sheer specs, Samsung wins because the S25 Ultra has a quad camera setup with a 200-megapixel wide lens, a 50-megapixel ultra wide lens, a 50 megapixel telephoto lens, and an extra 10-megapixel telephoto lens. The extra telephoto lens allows for more versatility with different optical zoom options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987523" /><br/>
Adding more megapixels lets you crop in more and it can preserve detail when doing so, but smartphone cameras these days are advanced enough that you're going to get fantastic pictures regardless of whether you have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or a Samsung device. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-10.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987531" /><br/>
That said, there are notable differences in under-the-hood processing techniques, plus some areas where Apple has an edge and some areas where Samsung excels.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987524" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max simply cannot compete with the Galaxy S25 on optical and software-enhanced digital zoom. The Galaxy S25 has 5x optical zoom like the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but 10x "optical quality" zoom that uses AI, and it works well. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-9.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987530" /><br/>
Further, Samsung has a 100x zoom feature that's been getting better every year. Apple's digital zoom is limited to 25x, and there's so much noise that 25x images are unusable, but Samsung's comparable 30x images look decent.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987525" /><br/>
Comparing zoomed in photos is where you'll see the biggest difference between the S25 Ultra and the 16 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-5.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987526" /><br/>
When it comes to everyday photos, there are some areas where the S25 Ultra struggled. Low-light and night photos in particular showed some significant light flare and blur, and the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max performed better in these scenarios. Apple's image processing tends to be high contrast with vivid color, and that's clear here. Shots from the S25 Ultra tend to be a little more washed out, but which you like better is a matter of preference.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-6.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987527" /><br/>
Portraits were similar with both smartphones, and both did a good job separating the subject from the background and applying attractive blur.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-27.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987528" /><br/>
To match the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s video recording capabilities, Samsung added a new LOG video recording mode for pros, along with an Expert RAW mode that lets you adjust aperture before capturing a shot. Apple still has an edge when it comes to video, including stabilization.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-8.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987529" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[There are two new speculative execution attacks that impact recent Apple chips, according <a href="https://predictors.fail">to data shared today</a> by Georgia Tech students that discovered the vulnerabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/slap-flop-vulnerabilities.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1013" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987547" /><br/>
Named SLAP and FLOP, the two security flaws could allow an attacker to use a malicious webpage to spy on the contents of other webpages, giving attackers remote access to browsing history, credit card data, emails, location information, and more. Physical access to a device is not required, and the attack can be executed through a malicious site that bypasses Apple's browser protections.<br/>
<br/>
Several Apple A-series and M-series chips are affected, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and later and the A15 and later, which are in the following devices:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>2022 and later Mac notebooks</li><br/>
 	<li>2023 and later Mac desktops</li><br/>
 	<li>2021 and later <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models</li><br/>
 	<li>2021 and later iPhones</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
SLAP and FLOP were disclosed to Apple in May 2024 and September 2024, respectively, and while the attacks have not yet been patched, the researchers who reported the issue were told that Apple plans to address the vulnerabilities in an upcoming security update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple told <em><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-apple-cpu-side-channel-attack-steals-data-from-browsers/">Bleeping Computer</a></em> that it has not yet patched the flaws. "We want to thank the researchers for their collaboration as this proof of concept advances our understanding of these types of threats," Apple said. "Based on our analysis, we do not believe this issue poses an immediate risk to our users."<br/>
<br/>
SLAP affects Safari, while FLOP affects Safari and Chrome. Other browsers like Firefox could be affected too, but have not been tested. There is no evidence that SLAP and FLOP have been executed in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
Details on how SLAP and FLOP work can be <a href="https://predictors.fail">found on the website</a> dedicated to explaining the vulnerabilities.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vulnerabiltiies/">Vulnerabiltiies</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/apple-web-browser-vulnerabilities/">Apple to Patch Web Browser Vulnerabilities Affecting Recent Macs, iPads and iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-patch-web-browser-vulnerabilities-affecting-recent-macs-ipads-and-iphones.2448291/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[CVS is testing a new feature that is designed to allow <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Android users to unlock product cabinets to retrieve an item without the need to summon an employee, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cvs-wants-to-help-you-spend-less-time-in-cvs-84fdb56b">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/597939/cvs-app-open-locked-cabinets-feature">The Verge</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-pro-max.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964613" /><br/>
Many stores like CVS use locked cabinets for items that are often shoplifted, cutting down on retail theft. Locking items up, though, inconveniences shoppers because an employee has to be summoned to retrieve items for customers. CVS Health's chief technology officer Tilak Mandadi told <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> that people "really, really dislike locked cabinets," which is why the chain is testing a new procedure.<br/>
<br/>
CVS shoppers who have the CVS app (with CVS account), activate Bluetooth, and connect to in-store Wi-Fi can unlock locked product cabinets with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
CVS is testing the smartphone-based product unlocking in three of its retail locations, but it will soon be expanded to 10 to 15 stores. If the trial is successful, CVS plans to roll it out to all retail locations.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cvs/">CVS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/cvs-tests-smartphone-cabinet-unlocking/">CVS Tests Letting iPhone Users Unlock Product Cabinets Without an Employee</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cvs-tests-letting-iphone-users-unlock-product-cabinets-without-an-employee.2448285/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is continuing to promote the Beats Pill speaker, today sharing a new Valentine's Day-themed short ad that uses the cute anthropomorphized "Pill People" characters to highlight battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Be Mine Pill People Beats Pill" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yeov42l03o4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The spot features the red Beats Pill holding up a be mine sign and playing music in a Say Anything-esque scene. The white Beats Pill walks by and asks how long the red Beats Pill has been outside playing music. "17 hours," replies the speaker, before an end tag comes up that points out the device's 24-hour battery life.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Rumors about Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 series have so far sparked a good deal of discussion regarding a potential redesign of the rear camera module. Leaks suggest the cosmetic changes could be big, but whether they would impact the iPhone camera's existing capabilities is a question for which no-one has yet provided an adequate answer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iPhone-17-Pro-Dual-Tone-Horizontal-Single-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984820" /><br/>
<h2>The Camera Redesign Rumor Problem</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/">Several</a> rumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/iphone-17-pro-redesign-backed-by-supply-chain-info/">suggest</a> that for the iPhone 17 Pro models, Apple may transition from its traditional triangular lens arrangement to a horizontal, elongated bar or strip of lenses, similar to the one used on the <a href="https://store.google.com/in/product/pixel_9_pro">Google Pixel 9</a>. However, we've had conflicting information, with at least one source claiming that the iPhone 17 Pro models will retain the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/iphone-17-pro-to-stick-with-triangular-camera/">existing triangular configuration</a> amidst broader material redesigns of the rear casing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-17-Pro-Dual-Tone-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979818" /><br/>
The major point of concern with adopting a horizontal camera layout is its potential impact on the device's ability to capture spatial video for Apple Vision Pro — a feature currently supported by iPhone 15 Pro devices and all iPhone 16 models. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>What Is Spatial Video?</h2><br/>
Spatial video is an immersive video format that provides a more three-dimensional experience by capturing content from multiple perspectives. The technology allows viewers wearing Apple Vision Pro to feel as if they're present in the environment being filmed, offering a significant enhancement over traditional 2D video formats.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-apple-visioin-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911687" /><br/>
The shooting mode requires two cameras to record footage simultaneously when the iPhone is held in a landscape orientation, where the horizontal separation between lenses is crucial for them to mimic the distance between human eyes and create depth perception. Unlike standard 3D video that presents a static perspective, spatial video in this way creates six degrees of freedom, so that if the viewer shifts their position, the perspective in the video footage also shifts accordingly. <br/>
 <br/>
On iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models, spatial video is achieved by using the vertically aligned main Wide/Fusion and Ultra Wide cameras to capture these differing perspectives. Similarly, Apple adopted a vertical alignment design for the dual-lens rear cameras on the standard iPhone 16 models as a strategic move to allow for spatial video capture.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-iphone-15-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911686" /><br/>
Logic would therefore seem to dictate that if the iPhone 17 Pro models were to adopt the rumored elongated horizontal bar of lenses, they would no longer be capable of shooting spatial video in landscape orientation – in the process losing a core camera functionality that has been present in their predecessors for two generations. Conversely, were the non-Pro models to retain the vertical alignment of the two lenses currently used in the iPhone 16, spatial capture would become incongruously exclusive to Apple's more affordable flagship device.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if the standard iPhone 17 also adopted the elongated horizontal bar design, then no model in the series would be capable of spatial video. (Rumors suggest the same can already be said for the Plus-replacing "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/slim-iphone-17-could-be-iphone-air/">iPhone 17 Air,</a>" which allegedly features just a single camera lens).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-spatial-video-capture-lifestyle.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944102" /><br/>
Would Apple really be prepared to nix its spatial video capability from some, if not all, iPhone 17 models – a feature that it has spent so much research and development (not to mention marketing) in order to bring to iPhones? Many would suggest that none of these scenarios are likely.   <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Overcoming Spatial Technical Challenges</h2><br/>
There is another possibility, however. Recent advancements in computational photography may have opened avenues for creating spatial videos without the existing strict hardware constraints. For example, <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/splats-change-everything">Gaussian splatting</a>, which was invented less than two years ago, can generate photorealistic 3D models using data from multiple camera angles, even when using non-traditional camera arrangements. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/scaniverse.jpg" alt="" width="719" height="573" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987512" /><br/>
Niantic, a company with close ties to Google, has already been leveraging Gaussian splatting in its <a href="https://scaniverse.com">Scaniverse app</a> to create photorealistic 3D models. Not only that, Niantic's WebXR app "Into the Scaniverse" for the Meta Quest headset allows users to step inside the splats they have captured in Scaniverse and walk around.<br/>
<br/>
Could Apple be developing something akin to Guassian splatting for video – similar to its visionOS 2 feature that uses advanced machine learning to <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2024/06/visionos-2-brings-new-spatial-computing-experiences-to-apple-vision-pro/">transform a 2D image into a spatial photo</a> which then comes to life when viewed on Vision Pro?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/spatial-photo-visionos-2.jpg" alt="" width="3825" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987518" /><br/>
Of course, whether or not Apple is adopting something similar is anyone's guess at this point. Equally, there's no reason to believe one way or the other that Apple has developed its own, alternative solution that accommodates a "runway" style camera module redesign. The only thing we do know is that we'll learn everything when Apple announces the iPhone 17 series around its usual mid-September time frame. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spatial-video/">spatial video</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/iphone-17-camera-redesign-rumors-spatial-video/">iPhone 17 Camera Redesign Rumors Conflict on Spatial Video Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-camera-redesign-rumors-conflict-on-spatial-video-support.2448279/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hundreds of unique Apple iPods that belonged to the late designer Karl Lagerfeld are being auctioned by <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/karl-karl-lagerfelds-estate-v-le-studio-pf2553">Sotheby's</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/sothebys-is-auctioning-custom-ipods-from-the-late-karl-lagerfelds-massive-collection/">MacStories</a></em>).<br/>

Lagerfeld was a renowned German fashion designer who passed away in 2019. The auction features a range of custom iPods, including uniquely decorated models and rare first-generation devices. Each iPod is meticulously loaded with curated music.<br/>
<br/>
According to graphic novelist <a href="https://warrenellis.ltd/jot/three-hundred-of-them/">Warren Ellis</a>, "Lagerfeld famously had an 'iPod nanny' to digitize his collection for the iPods and to add new music to new devices. This is how he ended up with over 300 of them – he treated them like cassette tapes."<br/>
<br/>

Lagerfeld's collection also included other Apple devices, such as iPads, which he reportedly used as digital sketchbooks and diaries. Despite owning several iPhones, Lagerfeld avoided using email and instead maintained a preference for handwritten correspondence. <br/>
<br/>
The auction is part of a broader sale of Lagerfeld's estate featuring over 200 lots, providing a comprehensive look into his personal and professional life. It closes on January 31. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/apple-releases-ios-18-3/">iOS 18.3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/apple-releases-ios-18-3/">iPadOS 18.3</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/apple-releases-macos-sequoia-15-3/">macOS Sequoia 15.3</a>, software updates that enable Apple Intelligence on supported devices by default. Whether you own an iPhone, iPad, Mac – or indeed all three – regardless of what you think about Apple Intelligence, there's one reason why you may want to disable Apple's AI features at the earliest opportunity: To reclaim storage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963902" /><br/>
Apple's marketing machine has made much of Apple Intelligence since its announcement at WWDC in June 2024. Apple brought the first features to compatible iPhones, iPads and Macs in October with a point update to iOS 18/iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, followed by a further update in December that brought a more fleshed-out set of AI-powered features, with the most recent update adding some much-needed refinements. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the raft of updates, Apple Intelligence remains in beta, and in terms of the AI suite's current usefulness, opinions remain decidedly mixed. For some, however, when considering the relative worth of these features, the deciding factor will be their local storage overhead. According to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121115">Apple's support page</a>, Apple Intelligence now requires 7GB of storage space. This number applies whether you're using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-Free-Up-Storage-Feature-Redux-1.jpg" alt="" width="2072" height="1166" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977568" /><br/>
That might sound like a lot, but it's one way that Apple is able to tout the privacy credentials of Apple Intelligence. Many of these features run locally, and in order to do so, they must download AI models to your device(s), which currently requires 7GB of storage. This means if you have an iPhone, iPad, and a Mac, it effectively equates to 21GB of storage across your devices that is being taken up by AI models that you may never even use.<br/>
<br/>
But don't assume that 7GB is any sort of hard cap. In April, Apple is expected to release iOS 18.4 featuring some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/03/siri-2025-updates/">broad enhancements to Siri's AI capabilities</a>, which will likely hike the storage requirement further. And that's not even taking into consideration the storage demands that iOS 19 will bring later this year...<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AI or No AI? Time to Decide</h2><br/>
Here's the deal. After updating to iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, or macOS Sequoia 15.3, Apple Intelligence is an opt-out feature, not an opt-in feature. In other words, if you have updated – or plan to update – your devices to the new software, Apple Intelligence will be automatically enabled upon doing so. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-18.3-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-986493" /><br/>
Note that this still applies if you already disabled it in the previous point updates but then allowed the latest update welcome screens to steer you towards enabling Apple Intelligence again. If however you chose "Set Up Later" at the on-screen prompt, you have no action to take – these features will respect your prior decision and remain disabled. For everyone else, it's time to decide: Is Apple Intelligence really worth all those precious gigabytes? <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Why Disabling Apple Intelligence Reclaims Storage</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence utilizes something called the <a href="https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/MobileAsset">MobileAsset framework</a> to manage and deliver its machine learning models and related assets to your devices. This framework dynamically downloads and updates the necessary components, ensuring that your devices have access to the latest capabilities without requiring comprehensive system updates. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/clear-storage-space-iphone-ipad/">20+ Ways to Free Up iPhone Storage</a></li></ul><br/>
Thankfully, when you disable Apple Intelligence, the system identifies that the associated assets are no longer in use. The MobileAsset framework then purges these unused assets when additional space is required – optimizing and freeing up your local storage in the process. Here are the steps you need to take to ensure that happens.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/macOS-Sequoia-Genmoji-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982419" /><br/>
<h2>How to Disable Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
Disabling Apple Intelligence completely is simply a matter of flipping the associated switch on each supported device running the latest software. <strong>Compatible devices include any iPhone 16 model, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, any iPad with A17 Pro or M1 and later, and any Mac with M1 or later</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Disable Apple Intelligence on iPhone and iPad</h3><br/>
On iPhone and iPad, you can find it in <strong>Settings ➝ Apple Intelligence & Siri</strong>. Toggle off the switch next to <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong>.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Disable Apple Intelligence on Mac</h3><br/>
On Mac, open System Settings, select <strong>Apple Intelligence & Siri</strong> in the sidebar, then click the switch next to <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong> at the top of the menu window to toggle it off.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>What You Lose by Disabling Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
In iOS 18.2 or later, iPadOS 18.2 or later, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 or later, turning off Apple Intelligence will knock out the following features:<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>Genmoji</li><br/>
  <li>Image Playground</li><br/>
  <li>Image Wand in the Apple Pencil tool palette</li><br/>
  <li>Writing Tools</li><br/>
  <li>Clean Up in Photos</li><br/>
  <li>Create a Memory movie in Photos (not available in macOS)</li><br/>
  <li>Natural language search in Photos</li><br/>
  <li>Notification summaries</li><br/>
  <li>Reduce Interruptions Focus</li><br/>
  <li>Intelligent Breakthrough & Silencing in Focus</li><br/>
  <li>Priority messages in Mail</li><br/>
  <li>Smart Reply in Mail and Messages</li><br/>
  <li>Summaries in Mail and Messages</li><br/>
  <li>Siri enhancements, including product knowledge, more resilient request handling, new look and feel, more natural voice, the ability to type to Siri, and more</li><br/>
  <li>ChatGPT integration within Siri and Writing Tools</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
If you don't see any of the features listed above on your device, your specific model likely doesn't support Apple Intelligence, so you don't have anything to worry about.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/save-up-to-21gb-storage-disable-apple-intelligence/">Save 7GB Storage Per Device by Disabling Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/save-7gb-storage-per-device-by-disabling-apple-intelligence.2448265/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18.3 is the third major update to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> operating system, and while it isn't as feature rich as iOS 18.1 or iOS 18.2, there are some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> changes worth knowing about, as well as as some other tweaks, bug fixes, and security updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-18.3-Everything-New-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-986743" /><br/>
This guide covers everything new in iOS 18.3.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence">Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
After updating to iOS 18.3, &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; is an opt-out feature, not an opt-in feature. If you didn't have &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; turned on, it's now turned on automatically, and you will need to go to the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; section of the Settings app to turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963424" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
&zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/macos-sequoia-15-3-apple-intelligence-opt-out/">will also be automatically enabled</a> on devices running iPadOS 18.3 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.3.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; is available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/">iPad mini 7</a>, and all Macs and iPads with an M-series chip. On these devices, &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; is now turned on automatically when iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, or &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.3 is installed. In prior updates, you had to explicitly turn &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; on to be able to use the feature set.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="visual_intelligence">Visual Intelligence</h2><br/>
For <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, there are new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a> features that are accessible with Camera Control.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-986365" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/ios-18-3-camera-control-animals.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
You can now use &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; to add an event to the Calendar app, or to identify plants and animals.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">Apple Intelligence Notification Summaries</h2><br/>
iOS 18.3 makes several changes to &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; Notification summaries to address complaints over notifications that have false news headlines.<br/>
<br/>
Notification summaries for the News and Entertainment category have been temporarily disabled, and Apple is working on improvements. The feature will return in a future software update, but for now, these types of notifications will not be aggregated and summarized.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984229" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/bbc-news-apple-intelligence-summaries-clean-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
In the Settings app, when a user activates Notification summaries, Apple has added a warning that this is a beta feature, and that errors are a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985714" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/notification-error-warning-ios-18-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
For summaries that are still available through ‌&zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;‌, the text is italicized as a way to distinguish them from standard notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985713" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/ios-18-3-notification-summary-italics.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
Apple also added an option to manage whether notifications are summarized for an app right from the Lock Screen. To turn off summaries from the Lock Screen, swipe to the left on a Notification summary and then tap on options to get to the menu to disable it on a per-app basis.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="calculator">Calculator</h2><br/>
Apple made a change to the Calculator app, returning a feature that was removed with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. You can once again tap the equals sign twice to repeat the last mathematical operation.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960038" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Calculator-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple removed repeating operations in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, but it's back. Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners who used the Calculator app for things like calculating compound interest will now be able to do so again.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="black_unity_wallpaper">Black Unity Wallpaper</h2><br/>
The update adds a new wallpaper to go along with a new watch face and new Apple Watch band <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/2025-apple-watch-black-unity-band/">that were announced today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987365" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-2025-Black-Unity-Collection.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="bug_fixes">Bug Fixes</h2><br/>
There are fixes for a couple of notable bugs.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Siri Keyboard</strong> - The update addresses a bug that could cause the keyboard to disappear after you typed in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> request with the Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; feature.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Apple Music</strong> - iOS 18.3 fixes a bug that could cause audio playback to continue even after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> app is closed.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="security_updates">Security Updates</h2><br/>
iOS 18.3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/ios-18-3-macos-sequoia-15-3-security-updates/">fixes 25 security vulnerabilities</a>, including one that was actively exploited. A CoreMedia vulnerability could be used to elevate privileges, and Apple is aware of reports that it may have been used on devices running iOS 17.1 or earlier.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> vulnerability could allow an attacker with physical access to an unlocked device to access the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app even when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is locked, and Apple fixed several issues with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> that could allow attackers to execute code or crash apps.<br/>
<br/>
Two kernel vulnerabilities that could let malicious apps gain kernel privileges were addressed, and there are a handful of WebKit fixes for Safari. Given the number of security holes that were patched, it's a good idea to install the software to get the latest fixes.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-3-features/">iOS 18.3 Features: Everything New in iOS 18.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-3-features-everything-new-in-ios-18-3.2448243/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With today's watchOS 11.3 update, Apple accidentally broke watchOS updates for some older Apple Watch models, according to information circulating on social networks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/apple-watch-se-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-843540" /><br/>
For Apple Watch models that are unable to be updated to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>, such as the Apple Watch Series 4 and Series 5, there is an unintended bug that prevents some of them from installing the latest version of watchOS 10, watchOS 10.6.1.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Apple Mistake: Apple Watches that ended on watchOS 10.6.1 (Series 4/5, SE1) cannot update to watchOS 10.6.1 if they’re not already on it.<br><br>Apple bumped the CV required that ota‘s are associated with from 22 to 24, which would normally be associated with late-11.x watchOS</p>&mdash; Michael (@MasterMike88) <a href="https://twitter.com/MasterMike88/status/1883972875851637114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
An Apple Watch that was not running watchOS 10.6.1 prior to the release of watchOS 11.3 and iOS 18.3 is now unable to have the watchOS 10.6.1 update installed. So an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> 1, Series 4, or Series 5 owner running an older version of watchOS cannot install watchOS 10.6.1 at the current time.<br/>
<br/>
Further, some Apple Watch models running earlier versions of watchOS 10 cannot be paired to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This issue only applies to Apple Watch models that are limited to watchOS 10, and it is further only applicable to those not already running watchOS 10.6.1, an update that came out last August. Apple will likely fix this issue in the near future.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Marvel Snap, a popular game that was caught up in the TikTok ban, returned to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> today and it is once again available for download.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/marvel-snap.jpg" alt="" width="1902" height="1071" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987428" /><br/>
The game was published by TikTok parent company ByteDance, which led to its removal from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; when a law banning ByteDance apps from being distributed in the U.S. went into effect on January 19.<br/>
<br/>
Marvel Snap creators Second Dinner said on January 19 that the removal of the app and a simultaneous gameplay outage came as a surprise. The developers went to work getting the app reinstated, and promised to <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691">find a new publisher</a> to prevent any further issues.<br/>
<br/>
The game was back up and running as of January 20, and on January 24, Second Dinner said that Marvel Snap would return to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; as soon as this week. Along with re-adding Marvel Snap to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, Apple removed Marvel Snap from <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596">its list of ByteDance apps</a> that are not being distributed in the U.S. at the current time. Second Dinner has not yet provided details on the situation with ByteDance, or if it has secured a new publisher.<br/>
<br/>
To make up for the downtime, Marvel Snap players in the United States are being provided with extra experience and in-game rewards.<br/>
<br/>
The January 19 TikTok ban affected several other apps that are affiliated with ByteDance, including TikTok, TikTok Studio, TikTok Shop Seller Center, CapCut, Lemon8, Hypic, Lark - Team Collaboration, Lark - Rooms Display, Lark Rooms Controller, and Gauth: AI Study Companion.<br/>
<br/>
All of these apps are still unavailable in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in the United States, but are accessible for those who already downloaded the titles. U.S. President Donald Trump gave ByteDance a reprieve by ordering the DoJ to hold off on any enforcement of the law for 90 days, but as the law is still in place, Apple is required to comply. If Apple were to continue to distribute TikTok, it would be violating the law and could be punished after the 90-day period.<br/>
<blockquote>If you already have these apps installed on your device, they will remain on your device. But they can't be redownloaded if deleted or restored if you move to a new device. In-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible.<br/>
<br/>
Users in the United States won't receive updates for these apps, which could potentially impact performance, security, and compatibility with future versions of iOS and iPadOS, and some app functions might become limited or stop working since the app can't receive updates.</blockquote><br/>
It is not clear what will happen with TikTok and the other ByteDance apps. The law requires ByteDance to divest TikTok, giving control of the app over to an American company. Trump is reportedly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/25/white-house-in-talks-oracle-us-investors-tiktok.html">discussing the sale</a> of TikTok with "many people," and current rumors suggest that Oracle and a group of investors <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/25/g-s1-44779/tiktok-ban-deal-trump-oracle">could take over the app</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/marvel/">Marvel</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/marvel-snap-returns-to-app-store/">Marvel Snap Returns to App Store After TikTok-Related Ban</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/marvel-snap-returns-to-app-store-after-tiktok-related-ban.2448233/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple regularly releases new firmware for the AirPods, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, but the company has historically provided limited information on how to initiate an update. That changed today, and Apple updated its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340">AirPods firmware support page</a> with more specific instructions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/airpods-4-blue.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972562" /><br/>
Prior to today, here's what Apple said on the subject:<br/>
<blockquote>Firmware updates are delivered automatically while your AirPods are charging and in Bluetooth range of your iPhone, iPad, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi . You can also use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to check that your AirPods have the latest version.</blockquote><br/>
Apple still has that same information, but now it's accompanied by step-by-step instructions on how to force an update, including troubleshooting steps if your AirPods won't update.<br/>
<blockquote><br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Make sure that your AirPods are in Bluetooth range of your iPhone, iPad, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi.</li><br/>
 	<li>Put your AirPods in their charging case and close the lid.</li><br/>
 	<li>Plug the charging cable into your charging case, then plug the other end of the cable into a USB charger or port.</li><br/>
 	<li>Keep the lid of the charging case closed, and wait at least 30 minutes for the firmware to update.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the lid of the charging case to reconnect your AirPods to your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</li><br/>
 	<li>Check the firmware version again.</li><br/>
If you still can't update your firmware, reset your AirPods, then try to update your firmware again.</li><br/>
</ol></blockquote><br/>
This process was generally already known, but the specific steps for charging via a cable and the 30 minute+ wait time remove any ambiguity on how to get new firmware installed.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/airpods-firmware-update-instructions/">Apple Finally Explains How to Install New Firmware on Your AirPods</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-finally-explains-how-to-install-new-firmware-on-your-airpods.2448221/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Along with new features, the iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.3 updates that Apple released today include multiple security fixes, including a fix for vulnerability that may have been actively exploited on some devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/bug-security-vulnerability-issue-fix-larry.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896108" /><br/>
According to Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122066">security support document</a>, there was a CoreMedia bug that could be used to elevate privileges. Apple says that it is aware of a report that the bug could have been actively exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 17.2. Apple fixed the issue with improved memory management.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also addressed over 20 other vulnerabilities. One could allow an attacker with physical access to an unlocked device to access the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app even when an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is locked, and there were several issues with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> that could allow attackers to execute code or crash apps.<br/>
<br/>
Two kernel vulnerabilities could let malicious apps gain kernel privileges, and there were a handful of WebKit fixes for Safari.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the number of security issues fixed in the update, it is a good idea to update to the new software right away.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 11.3 and tvOS 18.3 also have a number of security fixes, so those updates should be installed as well. If you have macOS Sonoma or Ventura, Apple has released macOS 14.7.3 and macOS Ventura 13.7.3 with security improvements.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/ios-18-3-macos-sequoia-15-3-security-updates/">Update Now: iOS 18.3 and macOS Sequoia 15.3 Include 20+ Security Updates</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/update-now-ios-18-3-and-macos-sequoia-15-3-include-20-security-updates.2448218/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The update removes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> Notification summaries for news and entertainment apps in an effort to prevent misleading alerts, plus it italicizes all summaries done by &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There are also several bug fixes, and a change to the Calculator app. Apple's release notes are below.<br/>
<blockquote><strong>Visual intelligence with Camera Control (All iPhone 16 models)</strong><br/>
- Add an event to Calendar from a poster or flyer<br/>
- Easily identify plants and animals<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Notification summaries (All iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max)</strong><br/>

- Updated style for summarized notifications better distinguishes them from other notifications by using italicized text as well as the glyph<br/>
- Notification summaries for News &amp; Entertainment apps are temporarily unavailable, and users who opt-in will see them again when the feature becomes available<br/>
<br/>
<strong>This update includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:</strong> - Calculator repeats the last mathematical operation when you tap the equals sign again<br/>
- Fixes an issue where the keyboard might disappear when initiating a typed Siri request<br/>
- Resolves an issue where audio playback continues until the song ends even after closing Apple Music<br/>
