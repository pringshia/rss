		<description><![CDATA[Repair site iFixit last week shared a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-15-pro-max-teardown-ifixit/">video teardown of Apple's new iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, and now iFixit is back with a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/84145/a-microscopic-journey-iphone-15-unveiled">deeper look inside the standard iPhone 15</a>. iFixit's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> teardown includes an examination of many of the components with a microscope, giving us a view of the device we don't typically get.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iPhone 15 Teardown: A Microscopic Look Inside The iPhone 15" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgzkJSE5cq0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
With the microscope, iFixit is able to provide a closer look at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s casing, adhesive, and display, showing off individual pixels. There are zoomed-in views of everything from the battery connector to the magnets inside the Taptic Engine.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; is remarkably similar, which makes sense because the design has not changed. There is a larger 48-megapixel camera, though, which iFixit confirms is not, in fact, the same 48-megapixel camera that's in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max. The quad pixel "buckets" in the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;'s camera are around 22 percent smaller, which means that the camera is not able to perform as well in low lighting conditions as the camera in the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit's &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; teardown isn't revealing anything that we didn't already know, but <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/84145/a-microscopic-journey-iphone-15-unveiled">it is a fun read</a> thanks to the closer look at multiple components.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/">Teardown</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/ifixit-iphone-15-teardown/">iFixit Examines iPhone 15 Components Under a Microscope</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-examines-iphone-15-components-under-a-microscope.2406619/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://southernstraps.com/">Southern Straps</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> and one of <a href="https://southernstraps.com/collections/nylon-bands-for-apple-watch">Southern Straps' nylon bands</a> to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-1.jpg" alt="" width="2823" height="1588" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915891" /><br/>
Southern Straps is a small company that has been making high-quality Apple Watch bands since the Apple Watch debuted in 2015. It was the first company to start making nylon Apple Watch bands, and with eight years of experience, Southern Straps has had time to perfect its craft.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://southernstraps.com/collections/nylon-bands-for-apple-watch">Priced at &#36;40</a>, each of the nylon Apple Watch bands is made from a single piece of nylon that's doubled over, heat sealed, and stitched together. This multi-step process ensures that every band is ultra durable and able to hold up for multiple years. In fact, Southern Straps offers a five year warranty for its bands.<br/>
<br/>
There are twelve nylon band options, available in classic solid colors like green, black, and sand, as well as multi-colored striped options in colors that include blue and green, blue and pink, black and grey, blue and red, blue and white, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-2.jpg" alt="" width="3381" height="1902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915892" /><br/>
Each of the bands can be ordered with custom hardware in black, silver, or gold to match whichever Apple Watch you have. The bands come in two sizes, one that covers the 38mm to 41mm Apple Watch models, and one that covers the 42mm to 49mm models. The bands are compatible with every Apple Watch model from the original Apple Watch to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The nylon bands include pegged spring bars so you can change the hardware if you get an Apple Watch in a new size or opt for a new watch color.<br/>
<br/>

Southern Straps bands can be used on a daily basis, and they're suitable for everything from work to sports. The bands are crafted by hand and the company aims to make sure that only the best quality straps end up on customer wrists.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a "Shot on iPhone 15 Pro" ad starring singer Olivia Rodrigo on its YouTube channel in Canada. The video provides a brief behind-the-scenes look at a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/olivia-rodrigo-iphone-15-pro/">music video</a> that Rodrigo and her team shot entirely on the iPhone 15 Pro. Apple first shared the behind-the-scenes video on YouTube in the U.S. last month, but it is currently unlisted.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O8_4CHNxt_w?si=vUvnMaYf4AhBsS_k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The music video is for Rodrigo's song "get him back!" from her sophomore album "GUTS," released last month. Apple says the video used iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max camera features such as 4K ProRes video recording at 60 fps and 5× optical zoom.<br/>
<br/>
Rodrigo gained recognition for her lead roles on the Disney Channel show "Bizaardvark" (2016–2019) and the Disney+ series "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series" (2019–2022). She shot to stardom in 2021 after releasing her chart-topping debut single "drivers license," and released her debut studio album "SOUR" in the same year.<br/>
<br/>
The music video for "get him back!" was released shortly after Apple's event introducing the iPhone 15 lineup last month.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shot-on-iphone/">Shot on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/shot-on-iphone-15-pro-ad-olivia-rodrigo/">Apple Promotes &#039;Shot on iPhone 15 Pro&#039; Ad Featuring Olivia Rodrigo</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-promotes-shot-on-iphone-15-pro-ad-featuring-olivia-rodrigo.2406603/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has Samsung's 32-inch Smart Monitor M8 at the new all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Computer-Streaming-Included-LS32CM801UNXZA%2Fdp%2FB0C3WMX69W%3Fth%3D1"><strong>&#36;499.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;699.99. This is the updated version of the monitor (M80C) that launched over the summer, and it beats the previous record low price that we tracked in September by &#36;80.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/new-smart-monitor-m8-red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905560" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple sometimes releases new iPads in the fall, but a question mark remains over whether that will happen in 2023. We're now into October, and if Apple plans to release iPads before the holidays, this is the month it will most likely happen. Here's what we know so far.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-mini-and-Air-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915872" /><br/>
It's been almost a year since Apple released a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, the last being the two refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models and the latest low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, all released in October 2022. Going on recent tradition, new models are now long overdue. <br/>
<br/>
If you look at the last decade, Apple sometimes holds an annual fall event in which it launches new Macs and iPads. While that did not happen last year, there were October events in 2013, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2021.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> recently told <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> hosts that he <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/">does not</a> expect Apple to hold an October event because the company does not have enough new products and features to justify it. <br/>
<br/>
However, that doesn't mean we won't be seeing new iPads from Apple this year. Apple could choose to release new models via press release instead, like it did in January 2023 for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models and the second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>. At the same time, Apple may not have any new models forthcoming this side of Christmas 2023. So what do the rumors say?<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Rumors For 2023 iPads</h2></h2><br/>
In an article discussing stagnating global tablet demand in the second half of 2023, Taiwan-based <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/">said</a> investors expected an uptick in Apple's share of the tablet market owing to orders for a "small-size" &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in the fourth quarter. Additionally, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; earlier this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/airpods-apple-watch-ipad-apple-tv-2023/">reported</a> that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> update with a minor "spec bump" is not out of the question. <br/>
<br/>
In August, the leaker known as "ShrimpApplePro" also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/ipad-mini-7-could-be-coming-later-this-year/">suggested</a> a seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; was in the works at Apple, and said that they had seen evidence that at least one new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; model is coming this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Fanned-Pink.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869882" /><br/>
According to a recent report from <em>9to5Mac</em>, Apple is working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/">two new versions of the iPad Air 6</a>. The site claims that Apple has four separate models in the works (two each in cellular and Wi-Fi).<br/>
<br/>
Apple makes two versions of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; because it comes in two sizes, and <em>9to5Mac</em> speculates that Apple could release a larger version of the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>‌ to go along with the current 10.9-inch version, or debut "a more expensive model with better specs." The outlet says that its sources believe the ‌&zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;‌ 7 is coming "soon," but the report also says that all of the new iPads are on track to be announced "between now and WWDC 2024 in June," which is a wide window.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last updated the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; in March 2022 with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. If the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; were to be updated with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip one year after the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, that would point to an October 2023 launch. However, a later launch in 2024 is possible.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that Apple has updated the entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; on an annual basis since 2017, so there will either be an 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; released later this year, or Apple will break a six-year tradition. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Rumors Against 2023 iPads</h2><br/>
Apple during its August earnings call warned that ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌ revenue is expected to drop double digits, suggesting it does not expect to have products to entice customers during the holiday quarter beyond the recently launched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series and new Apple Watch models. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPad-mini-AND-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907943" /><br/>
That is in line with some rumors, which indicate major new ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌ launches are not expected until 2024. In January, established Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said the next &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; would likely enter mass production in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/new-ipad-mini-launching-next-year/">first quarter of 2024</a>. More recently, Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">said</a> he does not expect any new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models this year. Likewise, multiple rumors suggest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ models with OLED displays and M3 chips won't be coming until 2024. <br/>
<br/>
One other thing to consider is the introduction of Apple's Vision Pro headset. According to Apple, the Vision Pro will go on sale in early 2024, which likely means January to late April. Note that the Vision Pro uses an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip. If Apple's &#36;3,500 headset launched with a processor that is inferior to those already powering &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, that may seem strange to the average consumer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Summing Up</h2><br/>
Summing up, we could see at least one &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; unveiled in October, perhaps an &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, an &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, or an 11th-generation low-cost ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌, but these will be minor refreshes. It would be reasonable for at least one or two of these models to be updated in October 2023, but 2024 launches cannot be ruled out.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/will-apple-release-new-ipads-this-year/">Will Apple Unveil New iPads in 2023?

		<description><![CDATA[Social network X, previously known as Twitter, may soon offer more than one subscription tier. Code in the app suggests that the Premium offering could be split into three, including Premium Basic, Premium Standard, and Premium Plus.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/X-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904140" /><br/>
Premium Basic lists "full ads" in the For You feed, while Premium Standard says it has "half ads" in For You. Premium Plus says there will be no ads in For You. Given the specific mention of the For You feed, it sounds like all of the tiers will continue to have ads in replies. Revenue from reply ads is used for paying content creators on the social network.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">X Premium will be broken up into 3 tiers: <br><br>Premium Basic - Full Ads<br>Premium Standard - Half Ads<br>Premium Plus - No Ads <a href="https://t.co/I0CyaQf2ME">pic.twitter.com/I0CyaQf2ME</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1710060481296105874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
At the current time, a Premium subscription is priced at &#36;8 per month or &#36;84 per year, and there is no word yet on what the new tiers might be priced at. There are also no other details on the differences between the plans or launch information. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/">Twitter</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/twitter-premium-tier-changes/">Twitter May Be Planning to Add More Premium Tiers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitter-may-be-planning-to-add-more-premium-tiers.2406511/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Vision Pro Personas Have to Wear Generic Glasses</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, the built-in cameras will create a customized "Persona" that resembles the user, and this Persona is used in video chat apps like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Vision-Pro-Spatial-Personas.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899133" /><br/>
Creating a Persona involves a 3D capture of the face and upper body, but it turns out that Apple's technology won't be advanced enough to take glasses into account.<br/>
<br/>
As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/M1Astra">@M1Astra</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> code requires users to remove anything that covers the face, such as glasses. There does not appear to be any kind of secondary scanning mechanism to separately capture a user's glasses, and instead, Apple will allow users to "Select Eyewear" from a variety of options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/vision-pro-persona-glasses.jpg" alt="" width="1390" height="708" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915795" /><br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; code suggests that Vision Pro users will be able to choose from a range of different glasses and sunglasses options that come in common shapes like square, rounded, oval, aviator, and more, with thick and thin frames.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/wG7xbR6RL6">pic.twitter.com/wG7xbR6RL6</a></p>&mdash; M1 (@M1Astra) <a href="https://twitter.com/M1Astra/status/1710046954661527951?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Users will likely be able to find something that is close to their own frames, but there may not be an exact match available. It is not yet clear if color options will be available, but it seems like a level of customization that Apple would offer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple uses the Vision Pro cameras to bring a user's facial expressions and hand movements to their Persona, giving it a more realistic feel that mimics person-to-person interactions.<br/>
<br/>
Personas are one aspect of &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; that Apple is working on perfecting before the launch of the Vision Pro headset. In September, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/apple-vision-pro-developer-survey/">began surveying developers</a> who have the Vision Pro about their Personas, soliciting opinions on facial expressions, appearance matching, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is set to launch in early 2024 in the United States, and it will be priced at &#36;3,500.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-vision-pro-persona-glasses/">Apple Vision Pro Personas Have to Wear Generic Glasses</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-personas-have-to-wear-generic-glasses.2406505/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on two new versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> 6, according to a report from <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/05/ipad-mini-7-new-ipad-air-rumors/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The site claims that Apple has four separate models in the works (two each in cellular and Wi-Fi), though it is not clear what the differentiating factor would be if there are indeed two separate &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models coming.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/ipad-air-cyber.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875251" /><br/>
Apple makes two versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> because it comes in two sizes, and <em>9to5Mac</em> speculates that Apple could release a larger version of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to go along with the current 10.9-inch version, or debut "a more expensive model with better specs."<br/>
<br/>
Given that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup already features two sizes of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, a low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, a larger or higher-end &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; may not make a lot of sense. <em>9to5Mac</em> warns that Apple's plans could change and that a second &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; model might not appear.<br/>
<br/>
Prior rumors have suggested that Apple is working on a seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; and an 11th-generation low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, with neither tablet expected to feature major changes. <em>9to5Mac</em> says that its sources believe the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; 7 is coming "soon," but the report also says that all of the new iPads are on track to be announced "between now and WWDC 2024 in June," which is a wide window.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said in September that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">not likely to introduce</a> new iPads in 2023, and that &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models will instead come in 2024. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/">also said in September</a> that Apple is working on a new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and that it could be "coming soonish," so it continues to be unclear if we'll see an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; of some kind before the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not refreshed the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; since March of 2022, so it has been over a year since the last update. The current model includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, and Apple could wait for the debut of the M3 chip for an update, so &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; launch timing could be tied to M3 launch timing.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, it has not been refreshed since September 2021, though it is not a tablet that Apple updates regularly.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/">Apple Allegedly Working on Two New iPad Air Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-allegedly-working-on-two-new-ipad-air-models.2406493/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The two 10-meter light strands include 250 addressable LEDs that can be set to 16 million colors and multiple shades of white that range from 2700 to 6500K. With IP44 water resistance, the 250 lumen lights are able to be used indoors or outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
Lights can be controlled with the Nanoleaf app, with the Home app, or with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands. With the Nanoleaf app, there are customizable color palettes and light animations, plus an option to sync with music that's playing. There are nine preset scenes such as Holiday Magic and Crackling Fireplace.<br/>

The lights can be controlled via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Matter over Wi-Fi, plus there are physical controls available in case a smart device is not around when you want to change the color or turn the lights off. <br/>
<br/>
The Nanoleaf Smart Holiday String Lights can be <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/seasonal/holiday-string-lights/">pre-ordered from the Nanoleaf website</a> for &#36;120.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced SF Symbols 5, a new version of the library of iconography that it provides to developers for use in apps. The icons have been created to integrate with San Francisco, the system font that Apple uses for its devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/sf-symbols-5.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915777" /><br/>
There are more than 5,000 symbols in total, with SF Symbols 5 adding 700 characters. Some of the new symbols in the update include game controller buttons, weather conditions, additional currencies, and automotive indicators. The symbols are available in apps running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, tvOS 17, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The update also introduces symbol animations with behaviors like bounce, scale, and pulse defining how symbols and their layers move. Apple says that the animated effects bring "bring vitality to interfaces and provide feedback to user input while communicating changes in status and ongoing activity." To support animations, symbols have been redrawn and optimized for motion.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/sf-symbols-5-new-additions.jpg" alt="" width="1632" height="982" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915778" /><br/>
Apple included improved tools for developers who want to create custom symbols, including a library of enclosure shapes, badges, and slashes, along with updated annotation tools. A new inspector allows for animation previews for system symbols and custom symbols.<br/>
<br/>
Developers are able to use Apple's SF Symbols wherever there are interface icons, including navigation bars, toolbars, tab bars, and context menus.<br/>
<br/>
SF Symbols 5 can be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/">downloaded from Apple's developer site</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/sf-symbols-5/">Apple Launches SF Symbols 5 With 700+ New Icons for Developers to Use in Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-sf-symbols-5-with-700-new-icons-for-developers-to-use-in-apps.2406472/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset will support screen mirroring via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, according to code found in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-releases-visionos-beta-4/">beta 4 release of visionOS 1.0</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/visionos-windows.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900014" /><br/>
Code in beta 4 includes the following strings:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Select a device to mirror content to from your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></li><br/>
<li>Only one activity is available when mirroring or sharing your view through &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; or &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;.</li></ul><br/>
This suggests that users will be able to mirror their Vision Pro display to an external monitor or TV, or share their view with others through &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; or &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;. Other headsets like Meta Quest have similar features which can help to reduce the feeling of isolation of the headset user from others.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Reset EyeSight Data</h3><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.0 beta 4 also includes a new option to reset EyeSight data. EyeSight is the feature that displays a user's simulated eyes on the external display of the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. The option reads:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>You can reset EyeSight by going to Settings > People Awareness and tapping Reset Personalized EyeSight. This will remove personalized eye details from EyeSight, like your eye shape and measurements, but EyeSight will still use your skin tone where available. After you have reset EyeSight, you can restore it by recapturing your Persona.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Sharing of Persona Data</h3><br/>
The code indicates that a user's Persona will be sent to all participants in a &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; call in order to allow other participants to view the user's Persona. &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; can generate Personas via machine learning that allow users to share virtual representations of themselves that reflect face and hand movements in real time with others over &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>For &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; calls on a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; device, your Persona will be sent securely to all of the people on the call so they can view your Persona. After a call is completed, your Persona may remain stored encrypted on the other call participants’ devices for up to 30 days. The other call participants will be able to access your Persona only when they are on a call with you.</li></ul><br/>
The code also indicates that Personas, but not the data used to generate them, could be stored on Apple's servers, albeit in a manner that isn't accessible to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>To create your Persona and personalized EyeSight, &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; cameras capture images and 3D measurements of your face, head, upper body, and facial expressions. The data used to build your Persona and EyeSight do not leave your device. Your Persona may be stored on Apple servers, encrypted in a way that Apple cannot access.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Additional New Alerts</h3><br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0 beta 4 also includes the following new alerts:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Calling unavailable while in Travel Mode</li><br/>
<li>Brighten your lighting to use your Persona.</li><br/>
<li>This video has excess motion, and could cause discomfort if expanded.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Apple has stated that &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; will launch in the U.S. in early 2024 before expanding to other countries at later dates.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-vision-pro-screen-mirroring-tidbits/">Apple Vision Pro to Support Screen Mirroring via AirPlay and Other Tidbits</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-to-support-screen-mirroring-via-airplay-and-other-tidbits.2406464/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> was introduced in March last year, adding the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, Center Stage on the front-facing camera, a faster USB-C port, and several new color options, but it was still a fairly minor upgrade over the previous model from September 2020. As we near a year and a half since the fifth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; was introduced, what can users expect from the sixth-generation model and when will it launch?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/Air-2022-M1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2244" height="1272" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-839997" /><br/>
As of 2023, it has been some time since the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; had a major hardware refresh. Yet due to its positioning between the entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, it is not immediately clear what a new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; model could gain without cannibalizing the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There have been few concrete rumors about the features the next &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will offer as yet, so the overall picture of what to expect is still somewhat fluid. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has repeatedly said that an &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/airpods-apple-watch-ipad-apple-tv-2023/">update this year with a minor "spec bump"</a> is not out of the question, suggesting that the upgrade will be fairly iterative, targeting several small but significant areas.<br/>
<br/>
A chip upgrade is the most certain feature coming to the next &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; currently contains the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip. There have been no reports about what chip the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will feature, but the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip has now been in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; for almost a year, meaning that it should be more than suitable for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. For comparison, the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip was present in the previous-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; for 11 months before it came to to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. There is even the possibility that it could skip the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and get the M3 chip instead, depending on the timing of its release.<br/>
<br/>
A minor spec bump is also likely to include upgrades to the front and rear cameras, potentially bringing features like Photonic Engine to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for the first time. ProRes video recording, Audio zoom, stereo audio recording, Portrait mode, and Portrait Lighting support are all plausible upgrades in this area.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/ipad-air-m1-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840368" /><br/>
A horizontally oriented front-facing camera and a Thunderbolt port are among the other potential features for the sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. The latest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models brought connectivity upgrades like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for the first time. By now, these capabilities are overdue to make their way to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Similarly, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> hover, another &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro-exclusive feature, could finally trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; in its next incarnation.<br/>
<br/>
A new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; launching this year is certainly more likely than a new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; emerging, but Apple historically has only updated the device around every two years. While a refresh to add the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip is certainly possible in 2023, it may be more probable that Apple will again wait two years to update the device and target 2024 for a more worthwhile upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">"unlikely" to launch this year</a>, seemingly leaning into a 2024 launch for the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. However, a reliable Weibo leaker recently said that the sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october/">should launch in October</a> as the only &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; refresh of 2023, with "no mini and Pro this year."<br/>
<br/>
More strikingly, on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/the-macrumors-show-mark-gurman-iphone-15-event-expectations/">September episode</a> of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> podcast, &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; said that there is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/">new iPad Air</a> with improved specifications in the works and the device is apparently "coming soonish," likely this month. As such, the sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; appears to now be pending release, meaning that a launch in the near future cannot yet be ruled out. If a month passes with no such occurrence, the first half of 2024 will become the most likely scenario.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/">new report</a> suggests Apple is working on two separate sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models, but it unclear if this refers to two different size options or something else.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/ipad-air-6-new-features-and-launch-timing/">iPad Air 6: Potential New Features and Launch Timing [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-6-potential-new-features-and-launch-timing-updated.2406455/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A bug impacting search functionality in the Messages app for some iPhone 15 users appears to be fixed in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">second beta of iOS 17.1</a> released this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-Messages-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903379" /><br/>
Some early adopters of iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models have complained that the Messages app's search tool only displays recent messages after transferring content from another iPhone. The issue has been mentioned by several users across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/search-cant-find-old-messages-on-new-phone.2404157">MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/16orvq0/ios_17_search_function_for_imessage_only_showing/">Reddit</a> since the devices launched earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
The bug is present on all iOS 17 versions up to the first iOS 17.1 beta, but many affected users said it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/16yy2b6/ios_171_developer_beta_2_released/k3bd5fc/">has been fixed</a> as of the second iOS 17.1 beta. It may take a day or longer for the device to index and restore the older messages after installing the update. Some users said they needed to open the Settings app, tap on Messages, tap on Siri & Search, turn off all of the settings shown, restart the iPhone, and re-enable those settings to fix the issue.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 is expected to be released in late October, so users not interested in installing the beta might have to wait a few more weeks for the fix.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> now sits in the middle of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup below the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, but above the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-vs-iphone-13/">iPhone SE and iPhone 13</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> starts at &#36;599, while the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus are priced at &#36;699 and &#36;799, so how different are the two successive &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-13-vs-iPhone-14-Feature-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915707" /><br/>
In 2021, Apple unveiled the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; as the successor to the popular &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, with improved rear cameras, longer battery life, the A15 Bionic chip, and more. The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; launched one year later, with the headline upgrade being a new &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus model with a 6.7-inch display – a screen size that was previously exclusive to Apple's "Pro" iPhones. Upon the debut of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, Apple dropped the price of the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus to &#36;599, &#36;699, and &#36;799, respectively. The &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini has now been discontinued.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; both feature the same display size, 5G connectivity, A15 Bionic chip, and design. Nevertheless, the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; still offers a number of upgrades, such as an additional GPU core, Emergency SOS via satellite, the Photonic Engine, and Action Mode.<br/>
<br/>
As the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; share the overwhelming majority of their features and have the same design, should you consider sticking with the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; to save money? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models is best for you, and serves as a way to clearly see the differences that the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; brings to the table.<br/>

</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;'s upgrades over the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; are fairly minor, offering small refinements in terms of photography and videography capabilities, battery life, and GPU performance. 6GB of memory, Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite, three features that also came to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max in 2022, are moderate upgrades for the safety-conscious. That being said, the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; is probably best suited to those coming from an older device and intend to keep their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for a long time.<br/>

</ul><br/>
<br/>
At face value, there is likely not enough to justify getting the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; over the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;. Matters may be different if you want a larger display size, as there is no equivalent to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus in the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup. Even then, the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus's &#36;799 starting price is the same as the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; – one of Apple's latest models. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; sports a wide array of new features, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a 48-megapixel camera, a USB-C port, and more, making for a much more attractive and future-proof purchase. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; is still highly capable for everyday use, and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; shares the vast majority of the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;'s most versatile features, such as the A15 Bionic chip, OLED Super Retina XDR display, Ceramic Shield, Night mode, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, and IP68 water resistance, so it is generally better to save the &#36;100 and get the older model, or opt for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; instead.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-13-vs-iphone-14/">iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 14 Buyer&#039;s Guide: Comparing Apple&#039;s Mid-Range iPhones in 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-vs-iphone-14-buyers-guide-comparing-apples-mid-range-iphones-in-2023.2356048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today marks the 12th anniversary of Apple's co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/05/steve-jobs-has-passed-away/">passing away</a> at the age of 56, following a cancer diagnosis.<br/>

Apple shared the following message on its website when Jobs passed away:<blockquote>Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.</blockquote>Apple still has a <a href="https://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">"Remembering Steve" page</a> on its website with condolences shared by customers around the world following his death in 2011.<br/>
<br/>
"There is not a day that goes by that we don't think about him," said Apple CEO Tim Cook, during the first media event at Steve Jobs Theater in September 2017.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing to release new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with more power-efficient mini-LED displays before the year is out, claims a new report by <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231004PD213.html">DigiTimes</a></em>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macbook-pro-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901497" /><blockquote>Apple is expected to ship new models of 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro devices in the fourth quarter of 2023 with miniLED backlighting that can increase the display brightness by 10% compared to the first-generation specifications, the sources said.</blockquote>Perhaps counterintuitively on first reading, the claim is that the increased brightness the enhanced mini-LED displays are capable of will not result in perceivably brighter displays on the MacBook Pro. Instead, the mini-LEDs will output the same brightness but use less power in the process. From the report:<br/>
<blockquote>Apple has not made major changes to the miniLED backlighting specifications since adopting it for its tablets and notebooks, the sources said. But the upcoming MacBook Pro devices will feature miniLEDs that are 10% brighter than the previous ones without changing the number of miniLED chips in the backlighting module, the sources said. The brightness enhancement is not meant to improve picture quality, but rather to save power and improve battery life, the sources said, adding that the new devices will start shipping in the fourth quarter of 2023.</blockquote>These claims are not out of the question, but there's good reason to doubt the launch timing in <em>DigiTimes</em>' latest supply chain report. Apple updated the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M2 Pro and ‌M2‌ Max chips in January, and most rumors suggest refreshed models are coming next year. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, the next version of these two machines are expected to feature M3 Pro and M3 Max chips and will "probably" launch by the middle of 2024 at the latest. Likewise, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes new MacBook Pro models with updated 3-nanometer M3 Pro and M3 Max chips are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/macbook-pro-2024-m3-pro-max/">set to launch in 2024</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Having said that, <em>MacRumors</em> received information earlier this week that indicates Apple will likely begin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-mac-this-month/">accepting some of its latest Mac models for trade-in</a> this month, suggesting it may be proceeding with plans to release a new Mac model imminently. Whether this correlates with the launch of at least one new machine around mid-October remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
The second part of the report is more aligned with rumor consensus, and goes on to suggest that the iPad Pro series may give up mini-LED backlighting and switch to hybrid OLED in 2024, while the MacBook Pro devices will continue using mini-LED until 2026, citing the burn-in problem usually associated with OLED screens as a remaining concern given that laptops tend to be left on for extended periods. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is widely rumored to be working on OLED technology for future Macs and iPads, and the company is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">switch iPad Pro models to OLED displays next year</a>. iPad Pro display sizes are expected to see a slight increase from 11 and 12.9 inches currently to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/">11.1 and 13 inches</a> with the next models. Apple is rumored to be planning to start mass production at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/ipad-pro-oled-display-mass-production-early-2024/">beginning of 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are not expected to be upgraded with OLED display technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/04/macbook-pro-not-getting-oled-until-2026/">until 2026</a>. That is when Apple's supply chain is expected to have sufficient notebook-optimized OLED display production capacity, according to Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants. Until then, Young believes suppliers will be focused on OLED displays for tablets, such as the iPad Pro, although an OLED MacBook Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/13-4-inch-oled-macbook-air-rumor/">could come earlier</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<em>DigiTimes</em> obtains its information from the suppliers who manufacture parts for iPhones and other Apple products. Its sources often provide reliable information, but the site has a mixed track record when it comes to interpreting that information and accurately deciphering Apple's plans. It is often best to view information from the site with some skepticism until the info is corroborated by additional sources, especially when it comes to rumors.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/new-14-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-2023/">Apple to Launch 14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Models With More Power-Efficient Displays This Year, Claims Report</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-with-more-power-efficient-displays-this-year-claims-report.2406409/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Back in 2018, Apple held talks with DuckDuckGo to replace Google as the default search engine in private browsing mode, but ultimately rejected the idea, according to transcripts unsealed by the judge overseeing the US government's antitrust trial against Google in Washington.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/duckduckgo.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="773" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-745060" /><br/>
Testifying in closed sessions, DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg said that his company had about 20 meetings and phone calls with Apple executives, including the head of Safari, in 2018 and 2019 about becoming the default search engine for private browsing mode. <br/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-04/apple-considered-switch-to-search-engine-duckduckgo-from-google?srnd=technology-vp">Bloomberg</a></em>, Apple did not move forward with the deal because John Giannandrea, who joined Apple as head of search in 2018, assumed that since DuckDuckGo relies on Bing for its search information, it also likely provides Microsoft some user information. <br/>
<br/>
That led Giannandrea to believe that DuckDuckGo's privacy marketing is "somewhat incongruent with the details." In a February 2019 email to other Apple executives, Giannandrea said it was therefore "probably a bad idea" to switch to DuckDuckGo for private browsing in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple seriously wanted to switch to DuckDuckGo, "I would probably insist on doing a lot more due diligence with DuckDuckGo," he said. <br/>
<br/>
The trial is between the U.S. Department of Justice and Google, with the DoJ pointing toward Google's dominance on Apple devices as evidence that Google has a search engine monopoly. A multi-billion dollar deal between Apple and Google sees that Google is set as the default search engine on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Last week the trial revealed that Microsoft considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/">selling</a> its Bing search engine to Apple. Had the acquisition happened, Bing would have replaced Google as the default search engine on Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's services chief ‌Eddy Cue‌ also had to testify, and he <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/">explained</a> why Google is the ‌iPhone‌'s default search engine. "We make Google be the default search engine because we've always thought it was the best," Cue said. He went on to say that Apple has not gone with another search engine provider because there is no "valid alternative."<br/>

While Google is the default search engine on Apple devices, users can choose to swap to Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Ecosia as an alternative. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/">Apple Privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duckduckgo/">DuckDuckGo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-considered-duckduckgo-default-private-search/">Apple Considered Making DuckDuckGo Default Search Engine in Safari Private Browsing Mode</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-considered-making-duckduckgo-default-search-engine-in-safari-private-browsing-mode.2406400/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

A live audio stream of the call will be available on Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">Investor Relations page</a>, and a recording will be available later in the day for replay.<br/>
<br/>
The quarter ran from July 2 through September 30. During this period, Apple's key product launches included the iPhone 15 lineup, Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and updated AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not provided formal guidance since early 2020, but analysts expect the company to report quarterly revenue of around &#36;89.2 billion on average, according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis?p=AAPL">Yahoo Finance</a>. Apple reported &#36;90.1 billion revenue in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Maestri provided the following commentary on Apple's earnings call last quarter:<blockquote>We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.</blockquote>AAPL closed at &#36;173.66 today, down from a 52-week high of &#36;198.23.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-q4-2023-earnings-results-date/">Apple to Report Earnings on November 2 Following iPhone 15 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-report-earnings-on-november-2-following-iphone-15-launch.2406383/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
