		<description><![CDATA[A refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> model will be announced this month, according to a rumor shared on Chinese social media.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/m2-ipad-pro-apple-pencil-hover.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="596" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-869663" /><br/>
The rumor comes from Weibo user "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Instant Digital</a>," who notes that after over five years without an update, Apple finally plans to refresh the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; this month. This corroborates <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">recent claim</a> that new Apple Pencils are on the way "in the next several weeks."<br/>
<br/>
There is a limited amount of information about what an updated ‌&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; might feature‌, but there have been rumors about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">magnetically interchangeable tips</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/">color sampling capabilities</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/">shorter design with a glossy finish</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models with OLED displays are widely rumored to launch this month, so it would make sense for a new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; to arrive alongside them. The company is also expected to introduce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory</a>, so it seems that both of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>'s accessories may be refreshed simultaneously. <br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital has a mixed track record in terms of revealing accurate information about Apple's plans, but its claims are worth paying attention to. The source was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">first to report</a> the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>'s Yellow spring refresh, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/">Spatial Video</a> capture on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/">minor hardware update</a>, as well as being the only source of the only rumor claiming that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus would feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/">frosted back glass</a>. However, they also made claims about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/25/ios-17-lock-screen-apple-music-rumors/">several iOS 17 features</a> and the release of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october/">new iPad Air in October 2023</a> that did not pan out.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/">New Apple Pencil Rumored to Launch This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-pencil-rumored-to-launch-this-month.2421108/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We're tracking a new record low price on the Apple Watch Ultra 2 today at Amazon, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7J5Z3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;663.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;799.00. Only the Indigo Alpine Loop in size medium is available at this best-ever price on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-watch-ultra-2-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939712" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Amazon provides an estimated delivery date of Friday for free delivery, although Prime members should get it by Thursday. This deal beats the previous all-time low price by nearly &#36;60, and also beats many of the deal prices we've seen recently on the first generation Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7J5Z3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;135 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;663.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few other Apple Watch deals going on right now for anyone interested in cheaper models. You can get the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8RVB8%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a> and the 44mm GPS Apple Watch SE for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5W8YM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;219.00</strong></a> right now on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
As of January, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/">sales ban was reenacted</a> in the United States on any Apple Watch model sold by Apple that has blood oxygen sensing. While Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models purchased directly from Apple currently come with blood oxygen sensing disabled, retailers like Amazon are able to continue selling through their existing stocks that include the feature.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[An early benchmark result for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">new MacBook Air</a> has surfaced, providing a closer look at the M3 chip's performance in Apple's latest laptops.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/macbook-air-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939665" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/5172580">Geekbench 5 result</a> spotted by <em><a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/apple-macbook-air-with-m3-chip-spotted-on-geekbench-heres-how-it-compares-with-macbook-air-m2/">MySmartPrice</a></em>, the MacBook Air with the M3 chip and 16GB of unified memory achieved a single-core score of 3,157 and a multi-core score of 12,020. The results have a "Mac15,13" identifier, which indicates they are for a 15-inch MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
For context, the previous MacBook Air with the M2 chip and 16GB of unified memory achieved a single-core score of 2,610 and a multi-core score of 10,120. The M3 chip in the new MacBook Air therefore scored approximately 20% more in single-core and 18% more in multi-core compared to the M2 chip in the earlier model, and is on par with the M3 chip in the 14-inch MacBook Pro as far as straight CPU benchmarks go.<br/>
<br/>
Featuring an 8-core CPU, up to a 10-core GPU, and support for up to 24GB of unified memory, the new MacBook Air is up to 60 percent faster than the model with M1 and up to 13x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air, according to Apple. <br/>
<br/>
Apple began accepting pre-orders for the new MacBook Air on Monday, March 4, and the first deliveries to customers and in-store availability will begin on Friday, March 8. Pricing for the new MacBook Air starts at &#36;1,099 in the United States, while the previous-generation 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip remains available for &#36;999.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/">Benchmarks</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mysmartprice-com/">MySmartPrice</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/first-benchmark-result-macbook-air-m3/">First Benchmark Result Surfaces for MacBook Air With M3 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-benchmark-result-surfaces-for-macbook-air-with-m3-chip.2421093/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales in China saw a significant decline in the first six weeks of this year that saw it lose the title of China's best-selling smartphone maker to a local vendor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/China-Weekly-Smartphone-Unit-Sales-Share-Growth-in-First-6-Weeks-of-Year-2024-vs-2023.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1157" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939686" /><br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales dropped by 24 percent, pushing Apple down to fourth among smartphone makers in the country, according to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/china-smartphone-sales-first-6-weeks-2024-double-digit-declines-for-apple-oppo-vivo/">Counterpoint Research</a>. Vivo took the top spot, thanks to its success in the budget segment of the market.<br/>
<br/>
That's despite both companies selling fewer phones, owing to a 7 percent drop in the overall Chinese market, which is suffering the effects of a nationwide deflation. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Huawei saw its market share grow to 16.5 percent from 9.4 percent, thanks to the popularity of its home-grown Mate 60 series. Apple recorded a 15.7 percent market share, falling from 19 percent a year ago, according to Counterpoint's data. Overall growth is likely to remain in the red during Q1 2024 on muted spending and a few new product launches, said the analysts.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; struggled during the first few weeks of the year for several reasons, according to Counterpoint. "Primarily, it faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi," said Senior Analyst Mengmeng Zhang. <br/>
<br/>
"Although the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now," he added.<br/>
<br/>
Apple resellers in China have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/iphone-sales-china-dependent-promotions/">increasingly dependent on discounts</a> to shift &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; stock in a market that has entered a general malaise. The discounts followed Apple's own <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/apple-offers-rare-iphone-discounts-china/">rare price reductions</a> on its website ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in February. <br/>
<br/>
Apple sales in China dropped 13 percent to &#36;20.8 billion in the quarter ended December, falling short of the &#36;23.5 billion predicted by analysts, and forecasts for a quick improvement in 2024 do not look particularly optimistic.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/">Counterpoint</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/china-iphone-sales-slump-early-2024/">iPhone Sales in China Declined 24% in First Six Weeks of 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-sales-in-china-declined-24-in-first-six-weeks-of-2024.2421087/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI has announced a new Read Aloud feature for its official ChatGPT app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> that allows users to have the chat bot read responses out loud in one of five voice options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/chatgpt-for-iphone-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896306" /><br/>
In the app, tap and hold the chat bot's text response, and then tap Read Aloud. You can also play, pause, or rewind the readout. The feature, which is also available on the web version of ChatGPT, adds another layer of voice-based interaction, and builds on the existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/22/chatgpt-app-voice-chat-free-to-all/">Voice Chat feature</a>, which gives users the option of speaking conversationally with the chat bot instead of typing.<br/>
<br/>
Read Aloud can speak 37 languages and can auto-detect the language of the text that it is reading. OpenAI says the feature should enhance accessibility for users with visual impairments or reading difficulties, such as dyslexia. It also hopes Read Aloud improves engagement by personalizing the interaction, while also supporting language learning.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ChatGPT can now read responses to you.<br><br>On iOS or Android, tap and hold the message and then tap “Read Aloud”.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">was today fined</a> €1.8 billion (&#36;1.95 billion) for anti-competitive conduct against rival streaming music services in the European Union, and following the ruling, Spotify has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-04/the-european-commission-confirms-apples-anti-competitive-behavior-is-illegal-and-harms-consumers/">praised the European Commission</a> for its decision.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810756" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" /><br/>
For context, the European Commission's investigation into Apple's practices started <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/">due to a 2019 complaint</a> from Spotify over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies. Spotify has long railed against Apple's 30 percent fee, and has complained that it is unfairly disadvantaged compared to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In a blog post, Spotify says that the European Commission has sent a clear message that "Apple's behavior limiting communications to consumers is unlawful."<br/>
<blockquote>Apple's rules muzzled Spotify and other music streaming services from sharing with our users directly in our app about various benefits--denying us the ability to communicate with them about how to upgrade and the price of subscriptions, promotions, discounts, or numerous other perks. Of course, Apple Music, a competitor to these apps, is not barred from the same behaviour. By requiring Apple to stop its illegal conduct in the EU, the EC is putting consumers first. It is a basic concept of free markets--customers should know what options they have, and customers, not Apple, should decide what to buy, and where, when and how.</blockquote><br/>
It is worth noting that the scope of the investigation in Europe has changed several times. While Spotify complained over Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fees and the requirement to use in-app purchase, the European Commission was unable to target Apple for those actions. Instead, the investigation ended up pertaining to Apple's anti-steering rules, and the rule that keeps Spotify from informing customers about lower prices on the web within the Spotify app.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission decided that Apple's restrictions preventing developers from letting iOS users know about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside the app is "illegal under EU antitrust rules." The EC claims that Apple caused customers to "pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions."<br/>
<br/>
Spotify in its blog post further says that Apple has "routinely defied laws and court decisions in other markets," and that it is waiting for the next steps that will "clearly and conclusively address Apple's long-standing unfair practices." Spotify claims that it plans to continue to push against Apple until it is able to secure a "truly fair digital marketplace everywhere."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been ordered to "remove the anti-steering provisions" and keep from repeating the infringement or adopting similar practices in the future. Apple plans to appeal the decision and has claimed that the EC's view is misguided and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/apple-spotify-limitless-access-no-fees/">has been heavily influenced</a> by Spotify's complaints.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify will soon be able to release an app outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; with support for alternative app marketplaces coming to the EU in iOS 17.4, but the streaming music company has complained that Apple's plans <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/spotify-epic-games-apple-dma-complaint/">do not comply</a> with the DMA and that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/spotify-on-apple-eu-app-changes/">changes coming in Europe</a> are a "complete and total farce."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/spotify-lauds-2-billion-eu-fine-says-apple-has-muzzled-streaming-music-services/">Spotify Lauds &#36;2 Billion EU Fine, Says Apple Has &#039;Muzzled&#039; Streaming Music Services</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-lauds-2-billion-eu-fine-says-apple-has-muzzled-streaming-music-services.2421067/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will soon release the first major software update for the Vision Pro, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/visionos-1-1-release-candidate/">new version of visionOS</a> will bring improvements not only to Personas, but also to the EyeSight feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-WWCD23-Vision-Pro-EyeSight-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922614" /><br/>
Personas and EyeSight are Vision Pro additions that many people have poked fun at since the headset's release. Personas are a digital representation of the user that's shown in video calls, while EyeSight uses an external display to show the Vision Pro wearer's eyes if there are other people in the room. Personas and EyeSight are aimed at making the Vision Pro less of an isolating experience, but neither has been particularly well-received.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/testing-personas-visionos-1-1/">we've previously shared</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.1 beta makes Personas look more realistic, and Apple's release notes provided with the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 release candidate offer more insight. Specific improvements have been made to hair and makeup appearance and neck and mouth representation, and these tweaks make a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Apple Vision Pro Persona FIXED in visionOS 1.1?" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEixxDkYXlo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The update also apparently improves rendering of the eyes for EyeSight, which isn't something that was previously noticed during the beta testing period. EyeSight draws on the Persona feature to capture a person's eyes to show on the external display. Presumably the EyeSight feature now looks somewhat better on the Vision Pro headset, but that it's gone so under the radar suggests Apple still has more work to do.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features in the update include improvements for the virtual keyboard and the Mac virtual display.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 will be officially released as soon as this week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/visionos-1-1-eyesight-personas-improvement/">Vision Pro Personas and EyeSight Improving With visionOS 1.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-personas-and-eyesight-improving-with-visionos-1-1.2421065/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, and tvOS 17.4, Apple plans to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 17.4 software update that adds a small but meaningful change to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/homepod-blue-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895477" /><br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to learn what a user's preferred media service is, which means that there won't be a need to include an app name when asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to play content or go through the process to set a default third-party app.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; users have been able to play songs, podcasts, audiobooks, and other media using supported third-party apps through a &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; request for quite some time now, but this needed to be set up in the Settings section of the Home app. The option was fairly hidden, so some &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; users might have forgotten the feature was even available. From Apple's release notes:<blockquote>This update enables Siri to learn your preferred media service, so you no longer need to include the name of the media app in your request.</blockquote>With &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 17.4, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will learn preferences and use those preferences to select apps. If you have YouTube Music, for example, you won't need to say "Play [song name] on YouTube Music" to bypass <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, nor will you need to set YouTube Music as your default music service in the Home app.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; already works this way on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and asks users for their preferred app when playing content for the first time. As &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has been updated to set a preference automatically, Apple has removed the Home app option that let users select a default media service.<br/>
<br/>
Third-party apps that work directly with the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; include YouTube Music, Deezer, Pandora, TuneIn, and iHeartRadio. Streaming music services need to support &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; for the feature to work, and not all do. Note that popular music service Spotify can play content through a &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; request on &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, but it uses the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Along with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; support for a preferred music service, the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 17.4 update also includes performance and stability improvements. The &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 17.4 software will see a release as soon as this week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/homepod-siri-music-preferences-17-4/">Siri Will Learn Your Music Preferences With HomePod Software 17.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/siri-will-learn-your-music-preferences-with-homepod-software-17-4.2421061/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning a software update that will add multi-display support to the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro model, the company confirmed to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/04/14-inch-m3-macbook-pro-multi-display-support/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models that were introduced today include support for up to two 5K external displays when used in clamshell mode, a feature that is not currently available on the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the same M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919851" /><br/>
With the two machines using the same M3 chip, it was not clear why the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has the feature while the MacBook Pro does not, but it is an issue that Apple plans to rectify. In the near future, a software update will add the option for the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro to drive two external displays when the lid of the machine is closed.<br/>
<br/>
Both the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and the M3 MacBook Pro offer support for one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz when the display is open, and with the update, the M3 MacBooks will also be able to power two 5K external displays with a resolution of up to 60Hz. That is equivalent to the Studio Display, so users can expect to be able to run two of Apple's 5K displays in clamshell mode.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro models are already able to drive multiple displays, so this change only applies to the 14-inch MacBook Pro that has the M3 chip. This machine replaced the prior-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro, which Apple has now done away with.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-pro-multi-display-support/">M3 MacBook Pro to Get Multi-Display Support With Software Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-macbook-pro-to-get-multi-display-support-with-software-update.2421042/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A court in British Columbia, Canada today approved Apple's settlement related to the iPhone battery throttling controversy in 2018, according to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/apple-settlement-british-columbia-supreme-court-1.7098096"><em>CBC News</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-6s-MacRumors-YouTube.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929156" /><br/>
Apple agreed to pay up to &#36;14.4 million (CAD) to settle a class action lawsuit in Canada that alleged the company secretly throttled the performance of some iPhone models. Each affected customer who submits a claim will receive a payment of between &#36;17.50 and &#36;150 (CAD) from Apple, with the exact payout amount to be dependent on the total number of claims submitted. More information on how to submit a claim will be shared on the <a href="https://www.smartphoneperformancesettlement.ca/">settlement website</a>, but a specific timeframe has yet to be provided.<br/>
<br/>
The class includes any current or former resident of Canada (excluding Quebec) who owned and/or purchased an iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and/or iPhone SE with iOS 10.2.1 or later installed or downloaded, and/or an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 11.2 or later installed or downloaded, before December 21, 2017. A serial number will be required for each affected iPhone, according to <em>CBC News</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has denied the allegations described in the lawsuit, and the settlement does not represent an admission of fault. The settlement allows for Apple to avoid the additional time and costs involved with continued litigation.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was sued in multiple Canadian provinces over iPhone battery throttling in 2018, including Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. The cases were filed shortly after Apple revealed that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/">started throttling the maximum performance of some iPhone models with "chemically aged" batteries</a>, when necessary, to prevent the devices from unexpectedly shutting down. Apple introduced this new power management system in iOS 10.2.1, but it initially failed to mention the change in that update's release notes, leading to public outcry. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/">Apple eventually apologized</a> about its lack of transparency, and temporarily lowered the price of iPhone battery replacements to &#36;29 (USD) until the end of 2018.<br/>
<br/>
Apple agreed to pay up to &#36;500 million (USD) to settle a similar class action lawsuit in the U.S., and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/06/apple-starts-iphone-batterygate-payouts/">payments started going out in January</a> there.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/">iPhone Slowdown</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-iphone-battery-settlement-approved-in-canada/">Apple to Pay Canadian Customers Up to &#36;150 Following iPhone Battery Controversy</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-pay-canadian-customers-up-to-150-following-iphone-battery-controversy.2421040/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate version of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.1 update for developers, allowing them to test new features ahead of the software seeing a public launch. The new update comes a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-releases-visionos-1-1-beta-4/">release of the fourth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>

The &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 brings support for iMessage Contact Key Verification and it adds Apple device management to the Vision Pro. With this functionality, IT departments at companies and educational institutions can manage Vision Pro headsets in the same way they manage iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's beta notes, users can now reposition volumetric scenes closer than before, enabling easier direct interaction with the volumetric scene content. That means objects can be placed closer to you.

- Enables account-driven device and user enrollment using Managed Apple IDs<br/>
- Support for device configuration (Wi-Fi, VPN, email accounts, single sign-on, and more)<br/>
- Support for deploying apps in volume including iPhone and iPad compatible apps, visionOS apps included in a Universal purchase, and proprietary in-house visionOS apps<br/>
- Support for remote erase via MDM and device inventory data<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Messages</strong><br/>
- Adds support for iMessage Contact Key Verification<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Accessibility</strong><br/>
- Closed captions can be anchored to the playback control while viewing Apple Immersive Video<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Persona (beta) and EyeSight</strong><br/>
- Adds an option to enroll your Persona hands-free<br/>
- Improves hair and makeup appearance<br/>
- Improves neck and mouth representation<br/>
- Improves rendering of the eyes for EyeSight<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Virtual keyboard</strong><br/>
- Cursor positioning for text input is now more accurate<br/>
- Resolves some instances where the virtual keyboard placement obscures the text input field<br/>
- Fixes an issue where in some cases, the text preview on the virtual keyboard may appear out of sync with the text field in the app<br/>
- Fixes an issue where the edit menu may appear unexpectedly<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Mac Virtual Display</strong><br/>
- Improves the reliability of discovering and connecting to a Mac using Mac Virtual Display<br/>
- Resolves an issue where Universal Control may stop working<br/>
- Addresses a connectivity issue that occurs when a previously paired Bluetooth device cannot be found<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Captive Network Support</strong><br/>
- Ability to set up your device while using a captive WiFi network such as those found at hotels, cafes and airports<br/>

The RC is the finalized version of watchOS 10.4 that will see a public launch next week. <br/>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.4‌ update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, watchOS 10.4 can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.4 includes new emoji characters such as a lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake). There is also a Setting to disable the Double Tap feature on Apple Watch when using Vision Pro, as the Double Tap gestures might be accidentally activated when controlling Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's release notes for the update are below:<blockquote>watchOS 10.4 includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes, including:<br/>
- Tap to Show Full Notification setting now allows you to double tap to expand the notification<br/>
- Using Apple Pay with Confirm with AssistiveTouch will require a passcode for additional security and will not support double clicking the side button<br/>
- Resolves an issue that causes some users to experience false touches on the display<br/>
- Fixes an issue that prevents contacts from syncing to Apple Watch for some users<br/>

Up to three chats will soon be able to pinned to the top of the message inbox, with support for both group messages and one on one conversations. Swipe left or tap and hold on a chat and choose the "pin" option to pin it to the top of the messaging interface.<br/>
<br/>
Instagram added a new toggle for disabling read receipts, which can be done for all chats or just for certain chats. The account-wide setting can be turned on in the settings section by going to Messages and then story replies.<br/>
<br/>
Along with these updates, Instagram introduced several new themes that can be activated on a per-chat basis, plus there is now an option to save favorite stickers in DMs for quicker access. Pressing and holding on a sticker allows it to be saved.<br/>
<br/>
These new features are rolling out to Instagram users starting today, and it can take some time for the options to be available for everyone.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/instagram-dm-editing-pinned-chats/">Instagram Gains Direct Message Editing, Pinned Chats and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-gains-direct-message-editing-pinned-chats-and-more.2421029/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">today</a> brought the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> up to date with its latest-generation Apple silicon. The company has reworked the lineup and its pricing, phasing out the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> machine from 2020 and discontinuing the 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; introduced in June 2023, so which model should you buy?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M2-MBA-vs-M3-MacBook-Air-Buyers-Guide-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939499" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-macbook-air/">2024 MacBook Air</a> is available in 13.6- and 15.3-inch display sizes just like its predecessor, with the smaller model starting at &#36;1,099 and the larger model starting at &#36;1,299. The 13.6-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip from 2022 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m2-macbook-air-under-1000/">remains in the lineup</a>, now at a price of &#36;999. This means that buyers have the choice between the 2022 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, its 2024 successor, and a big-screen variant of the 2024 model. It is also worth remembering that it is possible to shave at least &#36;100 off the price of a new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; directly from Apple with education pricing.<br/>
<br/>
Read on to find out about all of the differences between the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models to help you decide which model is best for you, as well as if it may be worth upgrading. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="m2_vs._m3_chip">M2 vs. M3 Chip</h3><br/>
The main upgrade offered by the &zwnj;2024 MacBook Air&zwnj; models is the M3 chip. In benchmark tests, the M3 outperforms the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ by about 17% in single-core tasks and approximately 21% in multi-core tasks. In GPU performance measured by Metal benchmarks, the M3 exhibits a notable improvement of around 15% over the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌.<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The M3 chip introduces an all-new GPU architecture. This architecture includes Dynamic Caching, a breakthrough feature that optimizes GPU memory allocation and utilization, adapting in real-time to varying task demands. This enhancement not only boosts graphics performance for intensive applications but also bolsters the chip's overall energy efficiency. This is particularly beneficial for graphics-heavy tasks like advanced video editing, 3D rendering, and gaming. It also features support for AV1 video decode to provide more efficient and higher-quality video from streaming services.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon-buyers-guide/">Apple Silicon Buyer's Guide: Which Chip Should You Choose?</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Despite similarities in the 16-core Neural Engine between the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ and M3, the M3's adoption of a ‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌ fabrication process leads to more efficient execution of machine learning and AI tasks. Additionally, the M3 maintains up to 24GB of unified memory, just like the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌, but leverages the new process for more efficient memory bandwidth utilization.<br/>
<br/>
One other notable difference between the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ and M3 chips is their energy efficiency. The ‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌ fabrication process enables the M3 to achieve higher performance without a proportional increase in power consumption, making the chip particularly appealing for laptop users who value a balance between power and battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/how-much-better-really-is-m3/">M2 vs. M3 Buyer's Guide: How Much Better Really Is M3?</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Overall, the M3 chip is a considerable upgrade from the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌, distinguished by its higher transistor count, improved performance in CPU and GPU tasks, and superior energy efficiency. While the M3 offers clear advancements, the extent of its superiority does not necessitate an immediate upgrade for current ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ users, especially if their existing workflows are still completed comfortably. For new buyers or those upgrading from older models, the M3's improvements in performance and efficiency will be much more pronounced.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="other_differences">Other Differences</h3><br/>
There are a number of other notable differences between the two &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; generations beyond their chips. While these upgrades are fairly small, they are worth bearing in mind when contemplating whether to get the latest model.<br/>

 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><br/>
Overall, the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is a minor upgrade over its predecessor, largely focusing on enhanced performance rather than new capabilities. Its main target audience is those who have an older &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, such as an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; or Intel-based model, or no &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; at all.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you can leverage the specific advantages of the M3 chip and require maximum performance from its highly portable form factor, it is likely not worth buying the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; over the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for most users. However, if future-proofing is a major priority because you tend to keep your computer for many years, the extra &#36;100 to get the latest model will probably be warranted. The M3 model's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-two-displays-lid-closed/">support for two external displays</a> may also justifiably swing your buying decision if you have multiple monitors.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to buy a new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; from Apple and want the larger, 15.3-inch model, then the latest M3 model is your only option as the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 15.3-inch machine has now been discontinued. That being said, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 15.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is still readily available second-hand, refurbished, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#macbook_air">from third-party retailers</a> for prices well below the &#36;1,299 price of the latest model. If you want the larger model, it may be worth seeking out one of these <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#macbook_air">deals</a> on an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; model before opting for the latest M3 machine directly from Apple. <br/>
<br/>
It is certainly not worth upgrading from the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; to the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for the overwhelming majority of customers. Upgrading from an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; to an M3 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; may be more justifiable owing to the display size increase, but there is little that the latest generation meaningfully offers over its predecessor.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2-vs-m3-macbook-air/">M2 vs. M3 MacBook Air Buyer&#039;s Guide: All Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m2-vs-m3-macbook-air-buyers-guide-all-differences-compared.2421026/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
