		<description><![CDATA[Just a day after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/epic-games-supreme-court/">Epic Games appealed one portion</a> of its legal dispute with Apple to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple has now done the same for the portion that was ruled in Epic's favor, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-28/apple-asks-supreme-court-to-reverse-app-store-ruling-won-by-epic">reports <em>Bloomberg</em></a>.<br/>

The dispute between Apple and Epic <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/">dates back to 2020</a> with Epic seeking to overturn Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules requiring content purchases within iOS apps to go through Apple, which takes a 15% to 30% cut of the revenue.<br/>
<br/>
In multiple rounds of the dispute, Apple has won on every count with the exception of one regarding Apple's "anti-steering" rule that bars developers of many iOS apps from directing users to methods of purchase available outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, circumventing Apple's revenue cut.<br/>
<br/>
Apple had said it was considering appealing the ruling over its anti-steering provision to the Supreme Court, and back in July a judge ruled that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/app-store-rule-change-epic-games-delayed/">did not have to make changes to its policies</a> pending the potential appeal, which has now been filed.<br/>
<br/>
The Supreme Court will decide in the coming months whether it will hear either or both of Epic's and Apple's appeals, but if it does not take up either petition, the previous rulings will stand. Apple would be able to continue to disallow third-party payment processing within apps but would have to allow developers to inform users about other purchasing options outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-epic-appeal-supreme-court/">Apple Appeals Epic Games Ruling Over &#039;Anti-Steering&#039; Provisions to U.S. Supreme Court</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-appeals-epic-games-ruling-over-anti-steering-provisions-to-u-s-supreme-court.2405291/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17.1 Adds Custom Playlist Art Options to Apple Music</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple added a new feature to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> app in the first beta of iOS 17.1 that offers a selection of color-matched playlist artwork options for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17-Playlist-Artwork-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914404" /><br/>
As of beta one, Apple provides eight different artwork styles featuring geometric shapes and gradients, with the title of the playlist in the top left corner. The colors used in the artwork are picked from the album artwork of whatever song is first in the playlist. The default artwork continues to be the tiled album artwork of the first four songs in a playlist and the ability to choose a custom image from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> or Files remains.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, users had to keep the basic tiled image or upload a custom image. Since not all users have custom graphics or photos they want to use for playlists and the default artwork is relatively simple, playlists can be difficult to identify and look fairly generic. Now, users can quickly and easily set a unique appearance for each playlist that fits in with &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s UI.<br/>
<br/>
Other &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; changes and improvements in iOS 17.1 include favoriting songs from the Lock Screen and suggested songs in playlists. The ability for multiple users to collaborate on and add to the same playlist and &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; SharePlay for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> are also expected to be added in a future update. iOS 17.1 introduces a host of new features, including NameDrop to Apple Watch, UK <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">bank balances in the Wallet app</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/">more</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/custom-apple-music-playlist-art-options/">iOS 17.1 Adds Custom Playlist Art Options to Apple Music</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-adds-custom-playlist-art-options-to-apple-music.2405286/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M2-Feature-Blue-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881249" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

Both the Silver and Space Gray are on sale at this price, which is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 14-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max overheating concerns continue to make headlines this week, with the topic <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-new-iphone-15-overheat-dbd5171a">highlighted by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-27/apple-iphone-15-pro-users-complain-that-device-can-get-too-hot"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Both of the reports document anecdotal complaints from customers, and outline potential causes, but it's unclear how many devices are actually affected. <em>Bloomberg</em> said the overheating could be caused or compounded by the iPhone's setup process, suggesting that the higher temperatures might sometimes be a temporary condition. <br/>
<br/>
<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> quoted a customer who felt his iPhone 15 Pro Max remained hotter than his iPhone 13 Pro Max a few days after setting up the device:<blockquote>Thomas Galvin, a 23-year-old from Cleveland, says his iPhone 15 Pro Max has been "super hot" and that he is considering returning it. Apple customer support told him the heat was a result of setting up the new phone, but even a few days later, it is still "way worse than the iPhone 13 Pro Max," he said.</blockquote><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern said her iPhone 15 Pro Max did heat up while charging and performing processor-intensive tasks, such as gaming, but she said her iPhone 14 Pro Max reached similar temperatures in the same test. During typical everyday usage, Stern said the temperature of both devices was in a normal range. Many customers on social media have also said their iPhone 15 Pro is not experiencing any overheating, and the lack of hard data makes it unclear if there is a widespread problem.<br/>
<br/>
On Wednesday, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the titanium frame on iPhone 15 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/iphone-15-pro-overheating/">negatively impacts thermal efficiency</a>. Kuo believes that Apple will likely address the issue through software updates, but he said improvements may be limited unless Apple lowers the performance of the A17 Pro chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not commented on the concerns, and it's unclear if the company will actually make any software optimizations in future iOS updates.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">iPhone 15 Pro Overheating Concerns Highlighted in Two More Reports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-overheating-concerns-highlighted-in-two-more-reports.2405278/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An Apple-acquired company now renamed "Apple Payments Services" is likely behind the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">UK-exclusive Apple Wallet features</a> in iOS 17.1, potentially hinting that Apple has plans to launch additional financial services in the country.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/credit-kudos-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840785" /><br/>
Last year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/23/apple-acquires-uk-banking-startup/">Apple acquired Credit Kudos</a>, a UK open banking startup that sought to help lenders make better decisions. <em>MacRumors</em> has now learned  that Apple filed to change the name of Credit Kudos to Apple Payments Services Limited in July. "Credit Kudos" is now simply a trading name of Apple Payments Services.<br/>
<br/>
Credit Kudos offered insights and scores based on loan applications drawn from transaction and loan outcome banking data, sourced by the UK's open banking framework. The ability to see account balances directly in Apple Wallet is a new UK-exclusive feature in iOS 17.1, powered by the country's regulated open banking API. Since Credit Kudos' expertise focused on UK open banking, it seems highly likely that last year's acquisition is behind the new feature. <br/>
<br/>
It is not clear what Apple has planned for Credit Kudos' technology in the future, but it is almost certain that it extends beyond balance visibility in Apple Wallet, especially considering Apple paid £131 million (&#36;170 million) for the company in March 2022. The relatively recent decision to rename the company to Apple Payments Services similarly suggests that the company's work is ongoing. <em>MacRumors</em> understands that 31 employees left Credit Kudos following Apple's acquisition, but a team of over a dozen employees, as well as co-founder and CEO Freddy Kelly, remain at the company. <br/>
<br/>
Credit Kudos's API offered lenders a way to get faster, automated decision-making about loans with reduced risk and higher rates of acceptance. It is therefore plausible that the company's technology could aid Apple with the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> in the UK. The UK is among Apple's most important markets, with the country possessing the largest number of Apple Stores outside the United States and China, and new features and services are often first to reach the UK after launching in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's main credit product, &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, is available exclusively in the United States. It is possible that Apple could modify Credit Kudos's technology to work with the U.S.'s growing open banking sector to strengthen &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;'s credit checker, but Apple could also use it to credit check &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; applications in the UK directly since Credit Kudos is a licensed credit reference agency.<br/>
<br/>
Credit markets and financial regulation vary massively in countries around the world, so it would not be straightforward for Apple to launch &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; internationally. Apple would likely need to seek specific solutions to make lending decisions in each country, so it seems plausible that Credit Kudos could be the chosen credit checking platform for the UK.<br/>
<br/>
Following the success of &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; in the U.S., it could make sense for Apple to expand into overseas markets. While visiting Germany in 2019, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/30/tim-cook-visits-germany/">confirmed his interest</a> in launching &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; internationally.<br/>
<br/>
Apple often acquires smaller businesses to bolster its technologies and expertise without obviously or immediately rolling it into a product or service. On the other hand, many acquisitions do go on to be key parts of Apple's ecosystem. In recent years, Apple has acquired businesses such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/11/apple-acquires-shazam/">Shazam</a>, a music recognition service, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/25/apple-acquires-self-driving-car-startup-drive-ai/">Drive.ai</a>, an autonomous vehicles company. Acquired apps such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/31/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky/">Dark Sky</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/22/apple-acquires-popular-automation-app-workflow/">Workflow</a> were folded into or became new Apple apps. Specialized classical music streaming service <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/apple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-service/">Primephonic</a> is one of the latest companies to be integrated into existing Apple products, becoming the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Classical app.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-payments-services-behind-uk-wallet-features/">&#039;Apple Payments Services&#039; Company Likely Behind New Apple Wallet Features in UK, Potentially More to Follow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-payments-services-company-likely-behind-new-apple-wallet-features-in-uk-potentially-more-to-follow.2405276/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

There have been complaints about the new &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/iphone-15-pro-overheating/">getting too hot</a>, but other than a heat issue when using an uncertified USB-C cable to connect to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, Dan hasn't run into trouble and he hasn't seen overheating problems. The same is true for the rest of us at <em>MacRumors</em> - our iPhones appear to be functioning as intended and running cool following the initial setup and syncing period.<br/>
<br/>
With the switch to titanium, Apple lowered the weight of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, plus added contoured edges that are much more comfortable to hold. Dan says that this is one of the most notable changes for him, and it makes picking up an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> downright uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life has been solid, but the Action Button is a work in progress and it can take some time to figure out what's most useful. We'll have a dedicated Action Button video coming sometime in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
As for the camera, it's unsurprisingly pretty great. 24-megapixel photos make a difference, and the 5x Telephoto lens is an improvement over the prior 3x version. We're also planning an in-depth camera comparison, so stay tuned for that.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17.1, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/">currently in beta</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the UK can now view the account balance of their bank cards and credit cards right within Apple's Wallet app. Keep reading to learn how it works.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/uk-bank-account-apple-wallet-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914320" /><br/>
Apple's Wallet app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has been able to display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> transactions made using your bank and credit cards for a while now, but if you are a Wallet app user in the United Kingdom, a new integration in iOS 17.1 means you can view your current account balance from your bank, along with a history of your deposits and payments. If you have a credit card, you can also view your remaining credit.<br/>
<br/>
To get the additional account information, your bank needs to support the Open Banking API that Apple has implemented. Supporting banks currently include Barclays, Monzo, Startling, HSBC, Lloyds, and RBS, with more banks likely to come on board when iOS 17.1 is released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
The following steps show you how integration is securely authorized through the Wallet app. It's a simple enough process, and Apple will automatically redirect you to your bank app to authenticate the connection. Note that until iOS 17.1 is officially released, <strong>the iOS 17.1 developer beta must be installed on your iPhone</strong> for this to work.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Wallet app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap a card from a supporting bank.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Get Started</strong> under "See Balances and Full Transaction History for This Account."</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Continue</strong> to connect your account to Wallet.</li><br/>
<li>Check the account details that you are about to give Wallet permission to access, then tap <strong>Continue</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>In your bank app, enter your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s passcode or use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> to grant Wallet permission to access the specified account details.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet.jpg" alt="" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914317" /><br/>
<br/>
After following these steps, you'll be directed back to the Wallet app, where you will now see the available balance of your account underneath the bank card, along with your transaction history. If it's a credit card, you'll also see the remaining balance available, while a tap on the balance will also reveal your credit limit.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Wallet also keeps annual transaction histories for linked accounts. You can access them for each account in <strong>Settings -> Wallet & Apple Pay</strong>: Tap the connected account under "Connections," tap the card under "Accounts," then tap <strong>Account Activity</strong>, where you can view transactions by year.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple users in the UK still unable to make use of Apple Cash or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, it's nice to see Apple exclusively supporting a British banking standard in its Wallet app. Note that Open Banking is UK-specific: No US equivalent is currently available.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/">Apple Wallet</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">How to View Your UK Bank Account Balance and Deposits in Apple Wallet</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-view-your-uk-bank-account-balance-and-deposits-in-apple-wallet.2405247/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week, Apple launched the all-new AirPods Pro 2 with the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case. At the same time, we began tracking the first ever discount on the earbuds, and over the past day or two that &#36;49 markdown is back at Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/AirPods-USB-C-Port-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911675" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the new model of the AirPods Pro 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. Given that the accessory isn't even a week old yet, this is the best deal we've seen so far, and Amazon provides an estimated delivery date of late September/early October.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;199.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset. Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
Our full <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">Deals Roundup</a> has more information on the latest Apple-related sales and bargains.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> This deal has now expired. If the AirPods Pro 2 return to &#36;199.99, we'll be sure to update this article again.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update 2:</strong> The &#36;199.99 sale price briefly reappeared this afternoon, but has once again expired. If you don't see the deal on Amazon, be sure to check back later, as it could return later in the day. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Former Apple designer Jony Ive and OpenAI's Sam Altman are in advanced talks with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son to launch a &#36;1 billion venture to build "the iPhone of artificial intelligence," according to the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c64ffc1-f57b-4e22-a4a5-f9f90a7419b7">Financial Times</a></em>. The news follows a report on Wednesday that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/jony-ive-openai-design-ai-hardware/">claimed</a> Ive and Altman are in discussions about creating an AI gadget.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/jony-ive.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914301" /><br/>
According to <em>FT</em>, Altman wants Ive's design agency LoveFrom to help develop the ChatGPT creator's first consumer device. From the paywalled report:<br/>
<blockquote>Altman and Ive have held brainstorming sessions at the designer's San Francisco studio about what a new consumer product centered on OpenAI's technology would look like, the people said.<br/>
<br/>
They hope to create a more natural and intuitive user experience for interacting with AI, in the way that the iPhone's innovations in touchscreen computing unleashed the mass-market potential of the mobile internet.<br/>
<br/>
The process of identifying a design or device remains at an early stage with many different ideas on the table, they said.</blockquote>Son, Softbank's founder and CEO, has been involved in some of the discussions, which have centered around creating a company drawing from Softbank, Altman's OpenAI, and Ive's LoveFrom design agency. <br/>
<br/>
Son is said to be pitching a central role for British chip designer Arm, in which the Japanese conglomerate holds a 90% stake. Son is also offering &#36;1 billion investment in the venture, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
Ive is said to have been concerned about the compulsive nature of smartphone users' behavior, and the designer sees the project as an opportunity to create a way of interacting with computers that is less reliant on screens.<br/>
<br/>
Discussions are said to be "serious," but no deal has been agreed, and it could be several months before any official announcement, cautioned people with knowledge of the matter. Any resulting device would likely remain years away from launching.<br/>
<br/>
Ive left Apple to begin LoveFrom in 2019, recruiting at least four of his former Apple colleagues to work with him at the firm, including Wan Si, Chris Wilson, Patch Kessler, and Jeff Tiller.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ft-com/">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/">Jony Ive</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/jony-ive-iphone-artificial-intelligence-openai/">Jony Ive and OpenAI in Advanced Talks to Build &#039;the iPhone of Artificial Intelligence&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jony-ive-and-openai-in-advanced-talks-to-build-the-iphone-of-artificial-intelligence.2405241/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Facebook parent company Meta <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3">today announced</a> the upcoming launch of the &#36;500 Meta Quest 3, its newest mixed reality headset that goes up against the much more expensive Vision Pro that Apple plans to launch next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg" alt="" width="1385" height="779" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914163" /><br/>
Meta claims that the Quest 3 was redesigned from the inside out, and it features "4K+ Infinite Display resolution" thanks to two displays with a 2064x2208 resolution per eye and an "experimental" 120Hz refresh rate. Comparatively, Apple's headset uses 4K micro-OLED displays and provide a total of 23 million pixels.<br/>
<br/>
The Quest 3 is equipped with 3D spatial audio and a 40 percent louder volume range than the Quest 2. Meta is using Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip for the headset, and it offers double the GPU processing power of the Meta Quest 2. Meta says with the new chip, the Quest 3 supports "fast-action gaming, seamless full-color, and high-resolution passthrough."<br/>
<br/>
Two RGB cameras with 10x better resolution than the Quest 2 provide a view of the surrounding area, and virtual objects are able to be manipulated in your physical space. This is the augmented reality part of the headset, and it mirrors what's possible with the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3-controllers.jpg" alt="" width="1758" height="989" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914164" /><br/>
The Meta Quest 3 weighs in at 515 grams, which is over a pound, and it is slightly heavier than the Quest 2. There is, however, a slimmer optic profile thanks to new pancake lenses, so Meta says the headset is more comfortable to wear. There is a soft adjustable strap that holds it on the head, and the facial interface can be adjusted to improve comfort and field of view. There is 110 degree horizontal field of view and a 96 degree vertical field of view for extended peripheral vision, plus sharpness in the center field of view has been increased by 25 percent. Unlike Apple's headset, there is no eye tracking or iris scanning.<br/>
<br/>
For input, the Meta Quest 3 uses two Touch Plus Controllers that serve as a "natural extension" of the hands and offer tactile haptic feedback. Meta is using computer vision and machine learning sensors to follow hand gestures, and there are a series of cameras that enable controller-free navigation, which is similar to what's possible with the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Meta Quest 3 lasts for up to 2.2 hours per charge on average, and it does not include an external battery pack. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> also lasts for two hours when connected to its external battery, but it can run all day when hooked up to a power source.<br/>
<br/>
Other features include 8GB RAM, Wi-Fi 6E, an LED that lets people nearby know when cameras are in use, and support for connecting to a PC with the Meta Quest Link Cable and Air Link.<br/>
<br/>
The Meta Quest 3 is priced at &#36;499.99 for 128GB of storage and can be <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3">pre-ordered from the Meta website</a> starting today. Orders are set to start arriving in October.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/meta-quest-3/">Meta Debuts &#36;500 Quest 3 as Apple Prepares to Launch &#36;3,500 Vision Pro Headset Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-debuts-500-quest-3-as-apple-prepares-to-launch-3-500-vision-pro-headset-next-year.2405179/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yale today announced the launch of the <a href="https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-plus">Yale Assure Lock 2 Plus</a>, its latest smart lock that has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> integration and Apple Home Key support. With Home Key integration in the Wallet app, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or an Apple Watch can be used to unlock the door with just a tap.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/yale-home-key-lock.jpg" alt="" width="1510" height="848" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914168" /><br/>
The Assure Lock 2 Plus is a keyless entry lock, which means it does not have a backup key option. Aside from Home Key, it can be accessed with &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; commands or entry codes. The entry codes can be used to provide guests with access, and there is an optional Wi-Fi module for remote access to the lock.<br/>
<br/>
Yale today also debuted the <a href="https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-touch">Assure Lock 2 Touch</a>, a &#36;199 smart lock that has a fingerprint sensor and &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; integration, but no support for Home Key. Yale does not offer a lock that provides both Home Key support and a fingerprint sensor, so those interested in a Yale lock will need to choose.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-plus">Yale Assure Lock 2 Plus with Home Key</a> is priced at &#36;210 for Bluetooth connectivity, or &#36;290 for Wi-Fi support. The Wi-Fi models require a 2.4GHz network.<br/>

The <a href="https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-touch">Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch</a> is priced at &#36;199 for the Bluetooth version, with both keyed and key-free models available.

<br/>
Apple is offering multiple &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; models for purchase at the current time, and all of them offer similar ~15 percent discounts off of the standard prices. Discounts range from &#36;300 to &#36;1300 depending on configuration and starting price.<br/>
<br/>
The 2023 &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; models were introduced in June 2023 alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> models. They offer &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; performance and the same &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip in a more compact package.<br/>
<br/>
All of Apple's refurbished Macs are close to identical to new products. They are subject to a refurbishment process that includes full functionality testing, with any defective modules replaced, as well as a thorough cleaning and inspection. Refurbished products are eligible for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ and have the same 14-day return period as new Apple devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/refurbished-2023-mac-studio/">Apple Now Selling Refurbished 2023 Mac Studio Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-refurbished-2023-mac-studio-models.2405162/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> today filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court, which basically means the company is asking the Supreme Court to make a ruling in its ongoing legal battle with Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/app-store-blue-banner-epic-1.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800065" /><br/>
The Supreme Court is the last stop for &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; after it lost an appeal earlier this year. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/24/epic-games-loses-appeal-app-store-battle/">sided with the lower court</a> and ruled that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules do not violate antitrust law by not allowing for third-party marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2020, Epic has been pushing for a ruling that would allow it to skirt the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and offer apps directly to consumers through sideloading or an alternate store, but its legal arguments <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/epic-games-vs-apple-decision/">have not been successful</a>. Epic ultimately wants to sell digital skins and other goods to its Fortnite customers without having to give Apple a 30 percent cut of its proceeds.<blockquote>Epic also offers digital goods--such as outfits--that users can purchase for use within Fortnite. Epic has invested vast sums in developing not just Fortnite but those digital add-ons, to which Apple contributes nothing. But Apple required Epic to use its IAP and pay the 30% commission on every in-app purchase that any iPhone user made directly from Epic, no matter how many years after downloading Fortnite from the App Store.</blockquote>Epic's 488 page filing lists several reasons why the Supreme Court should hear the case, focusing on errors made by the lower courts and the significance of the case, as any major &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; change would impact hundreds of thousands of developers.<br/>
<br/>
The Supreme Court could opt not to hear Epic's case, and it only accepts a fraction of the cases that it is asked to review each year.<br/>
<br/>
When the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals made its decision, it upheld the ruling of the lower court, including the mandate that Apple allow developers to direct customers to purchase options outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apple does not want to make these &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; changes, and so it too may ask the Supreme Court to make a ruling on that portion of the case.<br/>
<br/>
Apple back in in July <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/app-store-rule-change-epic-games-delayed/">was given 90 days</a> after the appeals court ruling to decide whether it would petition the Supreme Court. Apple has not yet contacted the Supreme Court, nor has it hit that 90 day limit. When the 90-day limit expires, Apple will either need to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case or implement the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; changes that it has been ordered to make.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/epic-games-supreme-court/">Epic Games Asks Supreme Court to Hear Apple Case</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-asks-supreme-court-to-hear-apple-case.2405160/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a week after releasing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple has seeded the first beta of iOS 17.1 to developers. iOS 17.1 adds some features that Apple promised were coming to &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; in the future, plus it refines and improves some existing features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912333" /><br/>
This guide covers everything new in the first iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Music Favorites</h2><br/>
You can favorite songs, albums, playlists, and artists in the iOS 17.1 Music app. Favorited music is added to the Library and improves recommendations. Favoriting replaces the prior "Love" system and favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen's Now Playing widget.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-music-favorite.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="822" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914260" /><br/>
A star next to a track in an album means that it's a favorite, while a dot is next to the most played track. With the favorites system, the Music app is suggesting songs to add to playlists.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-music-song-suggestions.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="1229" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914261" /><br/>
Eventually, Apple plans to provide a Favorite Songs playlist and offer collaborative playlists, but these features do not appear to be implemented as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirDrop</h2><br/>
AirDrop transfers can now be completed over a cellular connection or Wi-Fi if you walk out of the range of the person you're sharing with. That means you will not have to stay close to someone if you are transferring a large number of files.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ios-17-1-airdrop.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="1796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914263" /><br/>
There is a new "Out of Range" toggle in the AirDrop section of the Settings menu that you can toggle to allow or disallow transfers over cellular.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>NameDrop on Apple Watch</h2><br/>
With watchOS 10.1 and iOS 17.1, an Apple Watch and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> can now be used to exchange contact information through the NameDrop feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/namedrop-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="2501" height="1396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906032" /><br/>
<h2>Ringtones and Text Tones</h2><br/>
The more than <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/ios-17-ringtones-text-tones/">20 new ringtones and text tones</a> that were added in the launch version of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; have disappeared in the first beta of iOS 17.1, but Apple will likely re-add them in a later update.<br/>
<br/>
Custom tones for Mail and Messages have been re-added.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>UK Bank Balances in the Wallet App</h2><br/>
UK users can <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2405112/post-32568420">add their UK bank accounts</a> to the Wallet app in iOS 17.1, allowing them to see their account balances, payments, purchases, and deposits.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Books App</h2><br/>
The "Reading Now" section in the Apple Books app has been renamed to "Read Now."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Journal App</h2><br/>
There is no sign of the promised Journal app in iOS 17.1, but there are mentions of Journaling Suggestions in the code, which indicates that it could be coming before too long.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Dynamic Island Flashlight Indicator </h2><br/>
When the flashlight is activated on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, or &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, there is now a flashlight icon in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> that lets you know that It is on. The flashlight icon for the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; was previously limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
 <br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/dynamic-island-flashlight.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914275" /><br/>
<h2>Controller Support</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1707161935358157268?s=20">includes support</a> for the Nintendo Switch N64 Controller.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Extend Wallpaper</h2><br/>
When you are setting up a new wallpaper, Apple has added an "Extend" option that can be used if the image does not fit the display.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Significant changes are expected to arrive with Apple's fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, in terms of both design and hardware, <em>MacRumors</em> has learned.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4, known internally under the codename Ghost, is expected to receive a new design derived almost entirely from the base model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>. According to our sources, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will use a modified version of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; chassis and will even maintain &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; test parameters for internal testing. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the chassis is concerned, two major changes are expected – an Action button and a USB-C port. The Action button, recently debuted on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, is a multi-purpose button which replaces the mute switch on newer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models. It can be configured to perform a variety of actions, depending on the user's preference.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is also set to receive a USB-C port in order to comply with upcoming European Union regulations. Our sources have seen extensive references to the E85 connector, which is what Apple calls USB-C internally. Apart from these two major differences, no significant changes are planned for the chassis compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, and it will likely not feature the curved edges of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup.<br/>
<br/>
As for the back of the device, the next &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will feature a single camera with the flash aligned in an arrangement similar to the third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;. The exact design of the camera bump, however, remains unclear at the time of writing. Apple has developed at least five different designs for the camera bump, with minor differences among them. They fall into two major categories:<br/>
<ul><li>Camera and flash encompassed in a single, oblong-shaped camera bump</li><br/>
<li>Only the camera ring raised from the main backplate surface</li></ul><br/>
Preliminary information suggests that the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 may feature a 48-megapixel rear camera, providing for a significant upgrade from the current model.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will also likely receive a new OLED panel, derived from the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;. The device will not feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> home button, but will instead have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> as the means of biometric identification. Multiple references to "Pearl," Apple's internal codename for &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; and associated hardware, have been spotted in relation to the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also working on an in-house 5G modem, codenamed “Sinope”, and is using the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 to test the new hardware. Current information suggests that the new modem is being tested on the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 and a derivative of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, known as "D84S." Originally, the new 5G modem was meant to make its debut with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, being available across the entire range. According to information from our sources, this may no longer be the case. Additionally, Qualcomm recently issued a press release stating that the company would be providing smartphone modems for Apple until 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Previous claims have suggested that Apple was developing the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 exclusively for modem testing, and that it was not intended for mass production or release to the general public. This theory seems unlikely, as it does not explain the amount of effort put into the overall design of the device including multiple camera bump iterations, as well as part changes.<br/>
<br/>
If the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 had been intended exclusively for modem testing, this likely would not necessitate a camera redesign or the inclusion of an Action button. From a pragmatic point of view, it would make more sense to reuse existing parts with only a minimum amount of modification, as was done with the D84S.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that the information presented here is preliminary, pre-preproduction information. The fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is still early in the development process, and changes are always possible. As a result, the information may not fully align with the specifications of final mass-production units, assuming the project makes it to this stage.<br/>

		<title>New Battery Health Features Remain Limited to iPhone 15 Models on First iOS 17.1 Beta</title>

		<description><![CDATA[All four iPhone 15 models have two new battery health features in the Settings app, including the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-battery-cycle-count-iphone-15/">view the battery's cycle count</a> and an option to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/iphone-15-80-percent-battery-limit-option/">more strictly limit charging beyond 80%</a>. On <a href="https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1704476683414409443">social media</a>, some users hoped these features would expand to older iPhone models in a future software update, but we are able to confirm that they remain limited to the iPhone 15 lineup as of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-1/">first iOS 17.1 beta</a> released today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17-Battery-Cycle-Count-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914246" /><br/>
It's early in the iOS 17.1 beta testing cycle, so there is still a chance the features are added to older iPhone models in a later beta. However, it's also possible there are hardware-related reasons behind the battery health features being limited to the iPhone 15 lineup. We've reached out to Apple for comment on the matter.<br/>
<br/>
On iPhone 15 models, the 80% charging limit option can be found in the Settings app under Battery → Battery Health & Charging → Charging Optimization. It is separate from the pre-existing Optimized Battery Charging feature on iPhones, which intelligently delays charging past 80% until a more appropriate time by learning the device's daily charging routine. When the 80% limit is enabled, the iPhone will never charge beyond that percentage, except on rare occasions to "maintain accurate battery state-of-charge estimates."<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210512">support document</a>, Apple says reducing the time that an iPhone battery is fully charged can reduce the wear on the battery and improve its lifespan.<br/>
<br/>
On iPhone 15 models, the battery's cycle count, manufacturing date, and first use date can be viewed in the Settings app under General → About. This information can provide additional insight into the health of the battery. The battery's maximum capacity remains listed under Battery → Battery Health & Charging.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 is expected to be released in late October.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-battery-health-features-iphone-15-only/">New Battery Health Features Remain Limited to iPhone 15 Models on First iOS 17.1 Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-battery-health-features-remain-limited-to-iphone-15-models-on-first-ios-17-1-beta.2405140/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the watchOS 10.1 beta that came out today, Apple Watch owners can use the new NameDrop feature to share contact information with another Apple Watch owner or with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Using the feature can be done by tapping into the Contacts app, selecting your profile, and then tapping on the "Share" option. From there, an animation directs you to bring the Apple Watch next to another Apple Watch or next to the top of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to initiate the contact information transfer.<br/>
<br/>
NameDrop was introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, but it did not make it into the initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> release. Apple has instead added it in this beta to make exchanging contact information simpler. NameDrop is part of AirDrop, and it sends out your Contact Poster, name, and phone number when you use it.<br/>
<br/>

NameDrop requires two iPhones running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, two Apple Watches running watchOS 10.1, or an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1.<br/>
<br/>
There are also signs of the new Double Tap feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and Ultra 2 feature in the watchOS 10.1 code, but the function is not enabled and Double Tap remains inaccessible for now.<code><div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/watchos-10-1-beta-namedrop-apple-watch/">watchOS 10.1 Beta Brings NameDrop to Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-beta-brings-namedrop-to-apple-watch.2405136/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming one day after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-ios-17/">launch of the iOS 17 operating system</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912331" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
We don't yet know what's included in the iOS 17.1 beta, but there are several &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; features that were not included in the initial release, such as the Journal app, collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists, an option to continue AirDrop transfers over the internet, the ability to use stickers as a Tapback reaction in the Messages app, an arrow for catching up on missed conversations in the Messages app, a favorite songs playlist in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, and a few other minor changes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has said that all of these features will be coming in a future update, so we are likely to see some of these changes in the iOS 17.1 update.<br/>
<br/>
We'll update this post when we find out what's new in the beta.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-1/">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2405112/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.1 update to developers for beta testing, with the update coming just a day after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-macos-sonoma/">public launch of macOS Sonoma</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/sonoma-desktop-wwdc.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900001" /><br/>
Registered developers can opt-in to the beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
There are several features that were announced at WWDC in June but that did not make it into the launch version of &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;. Apple says that these features are coming in an update later this year, so we could begin seeing some of them in this beta.<br/>
<br/>
Additions we are waiting on include interactive Music widgets, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Sync improvements, the option to use Stickers through the Tapback menu in Messages, Intelligent form detection and Enhanced AutoFill for PDF documents and forms, an option to complete words by pressing the space bar, collaborative playlists in the Music app, and a favorite songs playlist.<br/>
<br/>
When we learn what's new in the beta, we'll update this article.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-first-beta-macos-sonoma-14-1/">Apple Seeds First Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-1-to-developers.2405108/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>‌ update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌ can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
There's no word yet on what might be included in watchOS 10.1, but we'll update this article if and when we find out what's new.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-seeds-watchos-10-1-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Beta of watchOS 10.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-watchos-10-1-to-developers.2405110/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
