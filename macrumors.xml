		<description><![CDATA[In a continuation of the latest unprecedented leak, Apple's yet-to-be-announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> has reportedly surfaced on <a href="https://www.avito.ru">Avito</a>, a popular Russian classified ads website. The development follows recent videos from Russian YouTube channels showcasing what appears to be the unreleased laptop model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/m4-macbook-pro-leak-russian-ad.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970162" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://x.com/aaplpro/status/1843589085237051515">reports on social media</a>, the listing on Avito advertised a 14-inch MacBook Pro featuring the next-generation M4 chip. The device was supposedly configured with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, and offered in a new Space Black finish â€“ a color currently exclusive to the M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro models. The asking price was said to be around 720,000 rubles (approximately &#36;7,500), which is significantly higher than current MacBook Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, it appears that multiple units of the unreleased MacBook Pro were offered for sale, suggesting a batch was stolen from a Chinese warehouse and somehow made it into Russia. The listing reportedly included a note stating that the price changes daily and buyers should confirm before purchase. However, as of now, these listings have been removed from the platform, which prohibits the sale of "nonexistent" products.<br/>
<br/>
The latest leak comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eqPZ42NNTGI">unboxing videos</a> shared by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/">Russian YouTube channels</a> over the weekend. These videos purportedly show the upcoming MacBook Pro, revealing potential upgrades such as a three Thunderbolt port 4 for the base model (up from two previous-generation TB3 ports) and 16GB of RAM as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/">new minimum memory configuration</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While the authenticity of these leaks remains unconfirmed, they do line up with recent rumors about Apple's plans for its Mac lineup. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has suggested that Apple may introduce M4-powered Macs as soon as the end of October, with a potential release date of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/">November 1</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If genuine, this leak represents a significant breach in Apple's typically stringent security measures. The last time Apple faced a leak of this magnitude was in 2010 when an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 4 prototype was accidentally left at a bar in California.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not commented on these leaks, and it remains unclear how the company will respond to this apparent breach. As always, potential buyers should approach unofficial listings with caution, especially for unannounced products.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4/">M4</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/leaked-m4-macbook-pro-russian-classified-ad/">Leaked M4 MacBook Pro Appears for Sale on Russian Classifieds Site</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaked-m4-macbook-pro-appears-for-sale-on-russian-classifieds-site.2439604/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will soon release iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1, and these updates will bring the first Apple Intelligence features for compatible iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963424" /><br/>
Not all of the Apple Intelligence features that Apple has in the works are coming in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 updates, and there will be Apple Intelligence capabilities added in future iOS 18.2, iOS 18.3, and iOS 18.4 updates.<br/>
<br/>
We've rounded up everything Apple Intelligence-related that will be included in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 updates when the software comes out later this month.<br/>
<br/>
Note that Apple Intelligence is still being refined and perfected, and when it launches, it will launch in a beta capacity.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="writing_tools">Writing Tools</h2><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960221" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-writing-tools.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Proofread text checks for spelling and grammar errors, including word choice and sentence structure. You can accept all suggestions with a tap or go through them one by one with explanations.</li><br/>
 <li>Rewrite cleans up what you've written and shifts the tone without impacting your content. Options include Friendly, Professional, and Concise.</li><br/>
 <li>You can select text and get a summary of it with Apple Intelligence. You can choose to create a paragraph, pull out key points, make a list, or create a table. Summaries are available in Mail, Messages, and more.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You can select any text on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac and use Apple Intelligence to access Writing Tools for summaries and other features.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="siri">Siri</h2><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960222" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>There's a new glow around the edges of the display when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is activated, applicable to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>. On Mac, the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; window can be placed anywhere. The glow animates responsively to the sound of your voice so you can tell when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is listening without interrupting other things you're doing.</li><br/>
 <li>A double tap at the bottom of the display brings up the Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interface so you can type requests instead of speaking them. On Mac, you need to press the Command key twice to bring up Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; includes suggested requests so you can get your questions answered faster.</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can maintain context between requests so you can ask a question and then reference it in a second reply. If you ask about the temperature in Raleigh, for example, and then follow up with "what's the humidity?" &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; should know you mean in Raleigh.</li><br/>
 <li>If you stumble over your words when speaking to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, or change what you're saying mid-sentence, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will follow along.</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has Apple's product knowledge and support base for answering questions about your device's features and settings, and can even find settings when you don't know the exact name by using natural language search.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="mail">Mail</h2><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960207" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-smart-replies.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>There is a summarize button for summarizing any of your incoming emails, plus you will see a brief summary of an email in your inbox list rather than the first few lines of the email.</li><br/>
 <li>Mail surfaces time sensitive messages first when applicable, putting them at the top of your inbox so you see what's important right away.</li><br/>
 <li>Smart Reply provides quick-tap responses to emails that you've been sent, with contextual options based on what's in the email.</li><br/>
 <li>Multiple notifications from Mail will be summarized on your Lock Screen so you can see what's in an email without opening the app.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messages">Messages</h2><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960223" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-messages-smart-reply.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Messages has Smart Reply options for incoming texts, which analyze the content of messages to offer suggestions of what you might want to say.</li><br/>
 <li>Multiple Messages notifications are summarized on your Lock Screen.</li><br/>
 <li>You can use all of the Writing Tools features in the Messages app for proofreading and refining what you're planning to send.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960208" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-memory-maker.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>You can create a Memory Movie with just a description, such as "My cat in 2024," or "Orlando in the summer." The feature automatically picks relevant photos and chooses songs, but you can tweak through the Memory Mixes feature or choose a mood to guide the direction of the audio. You can also add in specific scenes and images you want to see throughout the memory when you're creating the prompt.</li><br/>
 <li>Natural language search is available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, so you can just describe what you're looking for, such as "Eric rollerskating while wearing green."</li><br/>
 <li>Search can also find specific moments in video clips.</li><br/>
 <li>Search offers up smart complete suggestions for narrowing down what you might want to find.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3 id="clean_up">Clean Up</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app also includes "Clean Up," a feature that lets you remove unwanted objects from your photos. The Clean Up tool in the â€Œ&zwnj;Photos&zwnj;â€Œ app is able to automatically detect objects in an image that might not be wanted, but you can also tap, circle, or brush over an unwanted object to remove it.<br/>
<br/>
Zooming in on an image can help with using a finger as a brush to remove smaller blemishes and issues with an image, and it is intelligent enough not to remove part of a person even if a person or main subject is selected.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962933" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Photos-Clean-Up-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Clean Up works on all images in the â€Œ&zwnj;Photos&zwnj;â€Œ library, including older images and images captured by other devices like a point and shoot camera or a DSLR.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="transcription_summaries">Transcription Summaries</h2><br/>
In Notes and other apps, you can record audio and get a transcript along with a summary of your transcript, which is useful for recording lectures and other audio. Transcription isn't an Apple Intelligence feature, but summaries are. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="focus_modes">Focus Modes</h2><br/>
There is a dedicated Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode that only shows you important notifications that need attention while filtering out everything else.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960224" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-focus-mode-changes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
When customizing an existing Focus mode or creating a new one, there is a new toggle to turn on Intelligent Breakthrough and Silencing. This option allows important notifications to interrupt you, while muting notifications that are not important, which is the same thing that the Reduce Notifications Focus does. You can override the notification settings for specific apps and people, which is how it worked prior to iOS 18.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960225" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-focus-reduce-interruptions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="notification_summaries">Notification Summaries</h2><br/>
Your incoming notifications are summarized so you can see what's new for each app at a glance. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ios-18-apple-intelligence-notification-summary.jpg" alt="notifications" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968372" /><br/>
<h2 id="phone">Phone</h2><br/>
Summaries of transcriptions generated from your phone calls are supported in iOS 18.1. The iOS 18.1 update adds the option to record a phone call and get a transcription, which is not an Apple Intelligence feature. What does require Apple Intelligence, though, is getting a summary from that transcription without reading through the entire thing.<br/>
<br/>
Note that you can start a recording by tapping on the record button in the upper left corner of the display when on a phone call. All participants are notified that the call is being recorded before the recording starts.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" alt="" width="5416" height="3047" /><br/>
Recorded phone calls are stored in the Notes app, where you can tap in to view a transcript and get a summary generated from that transcript.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2><br/>
When reading an article in Reader Mode, there is an option to have Apple Intelligence summarize the article for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960226" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-safari-summarize.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="app_store">App Store</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> supports natural language and descriptive app tags to make it easier to find exactly what you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_report">Apple Intelligence Report</h2><br/>
In the Privacy and Security section of the Settings app you can access an Apple Intelligence Report that lets you export your Apple Intelligence data as part of Apple's promise for transparency around Apple Intelligence. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> is required to access and export Apple Intelligence data.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960227" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-report.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_waitlist">Apple Intelligence Waitlist</h2><br/>
When iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 are released, you will need to go to the Settings app and join the Apple Intelligence waitlist. Apple is using a waitlist mechanic to ensure that behind the scenes downloads go smoothly and that the system isn't overloaded.<br/>
<br/>
While on the waitlist, Apple devices download necessary files for on-device processing, and the waitlist should only take a few hours at most. The waitlist is on a per-account basis, so you only need to sign up for it on one device to have access on multiple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_compatibility">Apple Intelligence Compatibility</h2><br/>
The iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 betas are only available to registered developers with an eligible device. Devices that cannot run Apple Intelligence will not see the update.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>All <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max</li><br/>
 <li>All Apple silicon iPads</li><br/>
 <li>All Apple silicon Macs</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_availability">Apple Intelligence Availability</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence is only available in U.S. English at this time, and it is not available to developers in the European Union or China. Device region and language need to be set to the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_launch_date">Apple Intelligence Launch Date</h2><br/>
iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 are expected to be released on Monday, October 28.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_features_coming_later">Apple Intelligence Features Coming Later</h2><br/>
iOS 18.2, which we should get before the end of the year, is expected to bring support for ChatGPT integration with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, Image Playground, and Genmoji.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.3, coming sometime around January, could bring some new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features, but that's not yet guaranteed.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4 is expected to have the bulk of the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Apple Intelligence features including support for on-screen awareness for responding to what's on your display, better per-app controls and app integration, and personal context for more personalized responses to queries. We'll likely get iOS 18.4 around March.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will also be adding support for additional languages in 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/">Here Are All of the Apple Intelligence Features in iOS 18.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-of-the-apple-intelligence-features-in-ios-18-1.2439580/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to be slowly moving away from regular, timed hardware and software releases that come on an annual basis, instead favoring more of a staggered product release cycle, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> highlighted in his most recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-06/when-will-apple-intelligence-be-released-when-is-apple-releasing-m4-macs-ipad-m1xksx7q">Power On newsletter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m3-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950298" /><br/>
Gurman suggests that Apple Intelligence is evidence that Apple is "ever-so-slightly" moving away from a big fall launch for its hardware and software products. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> debuted without any Apple Intelligence features, despite the fact that Apple Intelligence was a key focal point of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; at the Worldwide Developers Conference, and heavily advertised for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, the first Apple Intelligence features will come out in October in an iOS 18.1 update, and Apple plans to add new Apple Intelligence capabilities in iOS 18.2, iOS 18.3, and iOS 18.4. Everything that Apple highlighted in June 2024 won't be available until well into 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has delayed some software features in the past, introducing them in later updates, but with Apple Intelligence, Apple announced everything well in advance and made it clear that the software updates would roll out over time.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman suggests that Apple could continue on this path, adopting a strategy that will see it release products when they're ready rather than pushing to get devices out on a scheduled timeline. As Apple's product lineup has grown more complex, software has also become more complicated. This year, Apple had to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/17/apple-pulls-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro/">pull iPadOS 18</a> for the new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models after it was released, plus it had to remove beta versions of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-pulls-third-software-update-in-past-month/">watchOS 11.1</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/apple-pulls-homepod-18-1-beta-2/">HomePod Software 18.1</a> because the software was causing significant issues.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is not expected to stop offering yearly releases of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but there are signs that it is holding updates on some other products. There was no new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> this year (and it seems to be on a 3-year update cycle as of now), nor did Apple introduce a new Apple Watch Ultra, instead adding a new color for the Ultra 2.<br/>

Macs and iPads that are planned for 2025 will come at various points throughout the year and may not be tied to specific events like WWDC and the September &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; event.

<br/>
Gurman suggests that continuing on with a staggered approach could result in more innovation thanks to fewer timing constraints, and that such a strategy would also make Apple less predictable, which is something that the company aims for.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/apple-release-schedule-changes/">Apple&#039;s Shift Toward More Staggered Releases Could Bring More Innovation and Less Predictability</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-shift-toward-more-staggered-releases-could-bring-more-innovation-and-less-predictability.2439574/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Waiting for a New Apple TV? Here&#039;s What the Latest Rumors Say</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The current Apple TV was released two years ago this month, so you may be wondering when the next model will be released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" /><br/>
Below, we recap rumors about a next-generation Apple TV.<br/>
<br/>
In January 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">new Apple TV was planned for release in the first half of 2024</a>:<blockquote>Beyond the future smart displays and new speaker, Apple is working on revamping its TV box. A new version with the current design is in the works for the first half of next year with a faster processor, the people said.</blockquote>The first half of 2024 passed by without a new Apple TV, so that rumor has expired.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-06/apple-sept-9-event-preview-iphone-16-apple-intelligence-airpods-and-watches">Gurman said</a> "stable inventory" of the Apple TV suggested that a new model was not on the "immediate horizon" after all:<blockquote>While the company has been working on an update to the Apple TV set-top box for as early as this year, no new model has come to fruition and stable inventory of the device suggests a new version isnâ€™t on the immediate horizon.</blockquote>All in all, there is no longer a clear timeframe for the next Apple TV. If you are considering purchasing an Apple TV, we recommend at least waiting until October is finished, just in case a new model is announced this month like in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Here is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li><br/>
<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li><br/>
<li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV:</strong> March 2012</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Whenever it comes out, the next Apple TV is rumored to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">could have a sub-&#36;100 starting price</a>. In the U.S., the current Apple TV is available with 64GB or 128GB of storage for &#36;129 and &#36;149, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The batteries inside the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus use an innovative type of adhesive that can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/18/iphone-16-and-16-plus-9v-battery-removal/">loosened with low-voltage electrical current</a>. Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-16-repair-manual/">official repair guide</a> recommends using a 9V battery with alligator clips for this process, but DIY repair website iFixit has released a new USB-powered tool as an alternative solution.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iFixit-VoltClip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970054" /><br/>
As reported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24262373/ifixit-iphone-16-battery-repair-adhesive">by <em>The Verge</em></a>, iFixit is now selling a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/voltclip">VoltClip tool</a> that is essentially a pair of alligator clips with an integrated USB-C adapter. With a USB-C to USB-C cable, which is not provided, you can connect the tool to any USB-C charger or device that supports 9V or 12V output. iFixit has a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Use+the+VoltClip+to+Debond+an+iPhone+Battery+Adhesive/177712">step-by-step guide</a> with complete instructions.<br/>
<br/>
The adhesive debonding process takes roughly 60 to 90 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
The tool is <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/voltclip">available for &#36;10.95</a> on iFixit's online store in the U.S., with same-day shipping available on orders placed before 1 p.m. Pacific Time each day.<br/>
<br/>
This electrical removal process does not extend to iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max batteries, which still have stretch-release adhesive pull tabs.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/ifixit-usb-tool-to-remove-iphone-16-battery/">iFixit Releases New USB-Powered Tool to Remove iPhone 16&#039;s Battery</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-releases-new-usb-powered-tool-to-remove-iphone-16s-battery.2439544/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+'s acclaimed sci-fi series "Severance" is set to receive a rare Blu-ray release this December, just ahead of the much-anticipated second season (via <a href="https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=35303"><em>Blu-ray.com</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/severance-apple-tv-plus.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-842248" /><br/>
Severance premiered on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ in February 2022. It was an immediate hit upon its debut, quickly gaining attention for its unique premise and dark tone. The show follows Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) and his colleagues at Lumon Industries, where employees undergo a procedure called "severance." This process separates their work and personal lives by splitting their memories in two, creating a stark division between their identities inside and outside of work. <br/>
<br/>
The release of the first season on Blu-ray on December 17, 2024 will allow fans and collectors to own a physical copy of the series for the first time. The launch marks one of the rare occasions where an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ show will be available outside the streaming platform and on physical media.<br/>
<br/>
While &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ offers a growing catalog of original content, physical media releases have been infrequent. Unlike some streaming platforms that have embraced physical distribution of their most successful series, Apple typically retains a tight hold on its streaming exclusives. In the case of Severance, the release is being handled by Fifth Season, one of the co-production companies involved in the making of the show. Apple itself is not directly responsible for the Blu-ray's distribution.<br/>
<br/>
Severance on Blu-ray is <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSeverance-Season-One-Blu-ray%2Fdp%2FB0DJC3GWYG%3Ftag%3Dbluray-011-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26m%3DATVPDKIKX0DER">available to pre-order</a> on Amazon now for &#36;42.98. It is worth noting that the release is only in Full HD (1080p), without the option of UHD (4K). Season two of Severance is set to be released exclusively on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ on January 17, 2025.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/">Apple TV Shows</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/severance-to-get-blu-ray/">Apple TV+&#039;s &#039;Severance&#039; to Get Rare Blu-Ray Release Ahead of Season 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-s-severance-to-get-rare-blu-ray-release-ahead-of-season-2.2439537/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the final iPod nano and iPod shuffle models to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">obsolete products list</a> worldwide, marking the end of an era.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/ipod_nano_2015_feature.jpg" alt="" width="1552" height="873" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757305" /><br/>
Apple introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/07/15/apple-launches-new-ipod-touch-nano-shuffle/">new color options</a> for the seventh-generation iPod nano and fourth-generation iPod shuffle in 2015, and those models are now obsolete in particular. Apple went on to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/27/apple-removes-ipod-nano-ipod-shuffle/">discontinue the iPod nano and iPod shuffle</a> entirely in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
Apple considers a device to be "obsolete" once seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Once a device is obsolete, it is no longer eligible for repair at an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider, with the only exception being MacBook battery replacements for up to a 10-year period.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also added the iPhone 6 to its obsolete products list today. Apple had already classified the larger iPhone 6 Plus as obsolete <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/apple-says-iphone-6-plus-is-now-obsolete/">in April</a>, but the smaller iPhone 6 had remained available through resellers in select countries for longer, so it only became obsolete now.<br/>
<br/>
Last, Apple added the 2017 model of the 12-inch MacBook and the sixth-generation iPad to its vintage products list today. Apple considers a device to be "vintage" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple might offer to repair a vintage product, but only if parts remain available.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/obsolete-ipods/">Apple Says Final iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle Models Are Now Obsolete</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-final-ipod-nano-and-ipod-shuffle-models-are-now-obsolete.2439535/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rumors strongly suggest Apple will release the seventh-generation iPad mini in November, nearly three years after the last refresh. Here's a roundup of what we're expecting from the next version of Apple's small form factor tablet, based on the latest rumors and reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPad-mini-review-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="4114" height="2314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818321" /><br/>
<h2>Design and Display</h2><br/>
The new iPad mini is likely to retain its compact 8.3-inch display and overall design introduced with the sixth generation. However, one rumor suggests Apple may address the "jelly scrolling" issue by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">rotating the screen assembly</a>. This change would be made to minimize the noticeable lag when scrolling vertically in portrait orientation, which is a point of frustration for some users of the current model.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Performance Boost</h2><br/>
While the iPad Pro and iPad Air now boast M-series chips, the iPad mini 7 is expected to stick with the A-series. It's likely to feature either the A17 Pro chip from the iPhone 15 Pro or the A18 chip found in the iPhone 16. This upgrade should provide a significant performance boost over the A15 Bionic in the current model, as well as provide support for Apple Intelligence features.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Connectivity Improvements</h2><br/>
The new iPad mini is almost certain to include Wi-Fi 6E support, allowing connection to the 6GHz band on compatible routers. Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected, bringing the latest wireless connectivity standards to the compact tablet. Cellular models may transition entirely to eSIM, potentially eliminating the physical nano-SIM slot.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Camera Enhancements</h2><br/>
Apple might relocate the front-facing camera to the landscape edge, as seen in the latest iPad Air. This change could improve the video calling experience, especially when using the device in landscape orientation. The camera may also receive upgrades like HDR 4 support and a wider aperture.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pencil Compatibility</h2><br/>
The iPad mini 7 will likely support the Apple Pencil Pro, which introduced features like squeeze gestures, haptic feedback, and Find My integration. Apple Pencil Pro hover functionality may also be included.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Color Options</h2><br/>
While the current iPad mini is available in space gray, starlight, pink, and purple, the new model may adopt a color palette similar to the iPad Air. This could mean the introduction of blue and the removal of pink from the lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Release and Availability</h2><br/>
With supplies of the current iPad mini dwindling in stores, a November release seems increasingly likely. Indeed, well-connected <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman recently said that Apple could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/">release a new iPad mini alongside new M4 Macs in early November</a>, potentially on the first day of the month. The new model is likely to maintain similar pricing to its predecessor, starting at &#36;499 for the Wi-Fi model.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Future iPad Models</h2><br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple is developing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/">foldable iPad mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/apple-planning-to-bring-oled-to-ipad-mini-and-air/">incorporating OLED display technology</a> into the device, though neither of these updates are anticipated for 2024. An OLED display or a foldable iPad mini is not expected to arrive until 2026, 2027, or possibly even later.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Summing Up</h2><br/>
By all accounts, Apple's iPad mini 7 will be a modest yet meaningful upgrade, bringing Apple Intelligence support as well as performance and usability enhancements, rather than a dramatic redesign. As always, we'll have to wait for Apple's official announcement to confirm these details.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/ipad-mini-7-coming-next-month-what-to-expect/">iPad Mini 7 Coming Next Month: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-7-coming-next-month-what-to-expect.2439526/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apples-swift-student-challenge-to-open-in-february-2025/">announced</a> it will begin accepting submissions for the 2025 Swift Student Challenge for a three-week period starting in February.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/2025-Swift-Student-Challenge.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969979" /><br/>
The annual Swift Student Challenge gives <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/eligibility/">eligible student developers</a> around the world the opportunity to showcase their coding skills and creativity by building experimental "app playgrounds" with the Swift Playgrounds or Xcode apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said it will select 350 winners based on "innovation, creativity, social impact, or inclusivity," and it will invite 50 of those winners to spend three days at Apple Park in Cupertino, California next summer, with travel and lodging included. The trip will likely coincide with Apple's annual developers conference WWDC, which is typically held in June.<br/>
<br/>
This earlier-than-usual announcement gives students an adequate amount of time to prepare for the next Swift Student Challenge. Students can learn more and sign up to be notified when applications open on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/">Apple Developer website</a>.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/the-best-prime-day-deals-october-2024/">Prime Day kicked off</a> earlier today, and it includes some of the best prices we've ever seen on multiple AirPods models.

Similar to the first Prime Day, it will last for two days (October 8-9) and you can find a large selection of deals across Amazon's storefront, covering savings on tech, clothing, video games, groceries, and much, much more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Prime-Big-Deal-Days-Hero-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969557" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
For our coverage, we're focusing entirely on Apple and Apple-related discounts that can be purchased during this 48-hour event on Amazon. As of today, this includes deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
As is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated throughout the event, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles this week.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon Prime Big Deal Days requires you to have an <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_primelink_nonmember">Amazon Prime membership</a> to take advantage of the discounts. Amazon Prime offers a one month free trial, and otherwise costs &#36;14.99 per month or &#36;139.00 per year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/airpods-prime-day.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969576" /><br/>
<br/>
Starting with AirPods, you'll find a wide selection of solid deals across the AirPods lineup on Amazon during Prime Day. This includes a &#36;10 discount on the new AirPods 4 at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHMNQ5Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;119.00</strong></a>, as well as an all-time price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;168.99</strong></a> price on the AirPods Pro 2.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>M3 MacBook Pro</h2><br/>

The new MagSafe Chargers provide overall faster charging speeds with compatible iPhone models. When paired with a 30W power adapter, iPhone 16 models can charge at up to 25W wirelessly over MagSafe, which is 10W faster than a regular non-MagSafe Qi2 wireless charger.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 18, Apple further enhanced its satellite connectivity features for iPhone users with the introduction of Messages via satellite. Keep reading to learn how it works.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-via-Satellite.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955787" /><br/>
Available in the United States and Canada to owners of iPhone 14 models and newer, Messages via satellite enables users to exchange iMessages and SMS texts, including emoji and Tapbacks, through satellite connections when traditional networks are unavailable. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is using the infrastructure that it set up for Emergency SOS via satellite for this feature, but you don't need to be in an emergency situation to use it, and the service is currently offered at no additional charge.<br/>
<br/>
When an iPhone detects it's out of cellular or Wi-Fi range, it prompts users with an alert offering quick access to satellite-enabled services. These include Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, Find My, and Messages. Users can also access the feature directly from the Messages app when off the grid, with iOS providing on-screen guidance to help point the iPhone toward an available satellite.<br/>
<br/>
iMessages sent via satellite are end-to-end encrypted. However, it's worth noting that while iMessage functionality is fully supported, SMS capabilities are more limited to prevent abuse from automated systems. Emergency contacts and designated family members can initiate SMS contact at any time, but for other contacts, the iPhone user must send the first satellite SMS to enable responses.<br/>
<br/>
To familiarize yourself with this potentially life-saving feature, Apple has included a demo mode in iOS 18. You can access this demonstration by following these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Apps</strong>, then tap <strong>Messages</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Satellite Connection Demo</strong>.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-via-satellite.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960711" /><br/>
<br/>
This demo guides you through the process of establishing a satellite connection and sending messages, providing valuable practice for real-world scenarios and emergencies where the feature might be crucial.<br/>
<br/>
While the current version doesn't support Rich Communication Services (RCS), Apple could well bridge the remaining gap between traditional and satellite-based communications by expanding the feature's capabilities in a future iOS update.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emergency-sos-via-satellite/">Emergency SOS via Satellite</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/send-messages-without-wi-fi-cellular-iphone/">iOS 18: Send Messages Without a Wi-Fi or Cellular Connection</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-send-messages-without-a-wi-fi-or-cellular-connection.2439520/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>MacBook Pro With M4 Chip May Support Up to Two External Displays</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming entry-level M4 14-inch MacBook Pro may be capable of supporting up to two external displays with the lid open, up from one display supported in the current M3 model, if recent leaks are anything to go by.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/New-MacBook-Pros-Launching-Tomorrow-With-These-4-New-Features-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921192" /><br/>
Apple's existing M3 14-inch MacBook Pro comes with two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, not three Thunderbolt 4 ports like the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by M3 Pro and M3 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from fewer USB-C ports, the lack of Thunderbolt 4 support on the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the base M3 chip means it only supports one display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz (or one display with up to 4K resolution at 120Hz over HDMI) when the lid is open. Currently the only way to support to two external displays simultaneously is with the lid closed, based on the resolution (up to 6K) and refresh rate (up to 60Hz) of each external display.<br/>
<br/>
However, assuming the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-potentially-facing-worst-leak-since-iphone-4/">alleged Russian leaks</a> of Apple's unannounced 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 chip are reliable, the new M4 variant of Apple's entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro will come with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, as opposed to the two Thunderbolt 3 / USB4 ports found on the current model. This would mean it can support two external displays with the lid open instead of just one.<br/>
<br/>
While the upgrade from two TB3 ports to three TB4 ports has yet to be confirmed, such a change would better align the entry-level machine's capabilities with Apple's more powerful MacBook Pro models. <br/>
<br/>
As a reminder, M3 Pro supports up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt. The M3 Pro-powered MacBook Pro models also support one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the M3 Max supports up to four external displays in the following configuration: Up to three external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-m3pro-max-ports.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919715" /><br/>
Alternatively, M3 Max MacBook Pro models can support up to three external displays by connecting two displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz, or one display with 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, both the M3 Pro and M3 Max also support native DisplayPort over USB-C, and one display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
We should know for certain what the specs are for the base M4 14-inch MacBook Pro before the month is out. Apple is expected to announce new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models with M4 chips towards the end of October, with at least some of the new Macs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/">rumored to be released on November 1</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thunderbolt-4/">Thunderbolt 4</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/macbook-pro-m4-two-external-displays/">MacBook Pro With M4 Chip May Support Up to Two External Displays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-pro-with-m4-chip-may-support-up-to-two-external-displays.2439515/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you're looking for a silly Halloween costume idea, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> has some suggestions for you. Apple's personal assistant is equipped with a long list of costume suggestions that are updated on a yearly basis.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/siri-halloween-costume-suggestions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969926" /><br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s suggestions often involve puns, some of which are clever and some of which are downright silly. Some of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s costume ideas:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Dress up like a cat, put on an eyepatch, and be Nick Furry.</li><br/>
 	<li>If you wear a white sheet and draw tattoos all over your face, you'd be Ghost Malone.</li><br/>
 	<li>You could be a disembodied voice. Oh no wait. That's kind of my thing.</li><br/>
 	<li>Dress in yellow and white, then put on some little red horns, and be a deviled egg.</li><br/>
 	<li>Jump up and down, over and over, and shake your fist. You can tell people you're antigravity.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; for a Halloween costume idea is a feature that's been around for almost a decade now, but it's easy to forget the option exists, and there are also typically new costume suggestions to see each year.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to suggesting Halloween costumes, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can also read a selection of Halloween poems to you.<br/>

&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can give costume suggestions on iOS 17, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and earlier versions of iOS, as well as macOS and Apple Watch.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/siri-halloween-costume-ideas-2024/">Need a Halloween Costume Idea?
