		<description><![CDATA[With the watchOS 10.1 beta that came out today, Apple Watch owners can use the new NameDrop feature to share contact information with another Apple Watch owner or with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-namedrop.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911345" /><br/>
Using the feature can be done by tapping into the Contacts app, selecting your profile, and then tapping on the "Share" option. From there, an animation directs you to bring the Apple Watch next to another Apple Watch or next to the top of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to initiate the contact information transfer.<br/>
<br/>
NameDrop was introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, but it did not make it into the initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> release. Apple has instead added it in this beta to make exchanging contact information simpler. NameDrop is part of AirDrop, and it sends out your Contact Poster, name, and phone number when you use it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/watchos-10-namedrop.jpg" alt="" width="1118" height="430" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914235" /><br/>
NameDrop requires two iPhones running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, two Apple Watches running watchOS 10.1, or an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1.<br/>
<br/>
There are also signs of the new Double Tap feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and Ultra 2 feature in the watchOS 10.1 code, but the function is not enabled and Double Tap remains inaccessible for now.<code><div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/watchos-10-1-beta-namedrop-apple-watch/">watchOS 10.1 Beta Brings NameDrop to Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-beta-brings-namedrop-to-apple-watch.2405136/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming one day after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-ios-17/">launch of the iOS 17 operating system</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912331" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
We don't yet know what's included in the iOS 17.1 beta, but there are several &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; features that were not included in the initial release, such as the Journal app, collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists, an option to continue AirDrop transfers over the internet, the ability to use stickers as a Tapback reaction in the Messages app, an arrow for catching up on missed conversations in the Messages app, a favorite songs playlist in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, and a few other minor changes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has said that all of these features will be coming in a future update, so we are likely to see some of these changes in the iOS 17.1 update.<br/>
<br/>
We'll update this post when we find out what's new in the beta.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-1/">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2405112/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.1 update to developers for beta testing, with the update coming just a day after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-macos-sonoma/">public launch of macOS Sonoma</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/sonoma-desktop-wwdc.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900001" /><br/>
Registered developers can opt-in to the beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
There are several features that were announced at WWDC in June but that did not make it into the launch version of &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;. Apple says that these features are coming in an update later this year, so we could begin seeing some of them in this beta.<br/>
<br/>
Additions we are waiting on include interactive Music widgets, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Sync improvements, the option to use Stickers through the Tapback menu in Messages, Intelligent form detection and Enhanced AutoFill for PDF documents and forms, an option to complete words by pressing the space bar, collaborative playlists in the Music app, and a favorite songs playlist.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a week after the launch of the tvOS 17 operating system.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. There is no word yet on what's included in tvOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Beta of tvOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-tvos-17-1-to-developers.2405107/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's work on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a> has "lost all visibility" at the current time, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1707091228528201754">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. He says that if Apple does not adopt some kind of acquisition strategy to make inroads in the automotive market, it is unlikely that the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; will be able to go into mass production "within the next years."<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774147" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
It is true that there have been few &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; rumors in 2023, giving us little insight into what Apple is up to at the current time. One recurring theme in &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; development has been reports of internal strife over the direction of the project and the ultimate goal of the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Prior rumors suggested that Apple would begin testing on the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; in 2025, with Apple aiming to provide a vehicle to consumers in 2026, but now that we are closing in on 2024, it seems unlikely that Apple will make that timeline with how little we've heard about work on the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple seems to be putting a lot of focus on the Vision Pro headset at the current time, and the last &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; update came in March 2023. At that time, <em>Economic Daily News</em> suggested that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/apple-car-self-driving-system-reportedly-advances/">made improvements to the self-driving capabilities</a> of the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; and was expanding its testing, but there's been no word since then.<br/>
<br/>
Late last year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple had significantly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/06/apple-car-project-scaled-back-delayed/">scaled back its Apple Car project</a> and no longer had plans to release a fully autonomous vehicle. Apple was aiming to design a car without a steering wheel or pedals, but decided that such a plan is not feasible. Instead, the car will allegedly have guided driving features that work on highways, but will not operate on its own at all times.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet established a manufacturing partner for the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;, so Kuo's suggestion that we may not see any sign of an &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; in the next few years without major changes makes sense. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-car-development-lost-all-visibility/">Kuo: Development of Apple Car Has &#039;Lost All Visibility&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-development-of-apple-car-has-lost-all-visibility.2405104/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to release new MacBooks and iPads with 3nm chips in 2024, but demand for the devices might be "below expectations" due to a "lack of growth drivers," according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/asml-likely-to-cut-euv-equipment-shipment-forecasts-significantly-for-2024-by-about-20-30-31cad57b4d8">research shared today</a> by supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898577" /><br/>
Kuo explained in a blog post on Medium:<blockquote>Apple's 3nm demand for 2024 would be below expectations. In 2023, Apple's MacBook and iPad shipments declined significantly by approximately 30% and 22% to 17 million and 48 million units, respectively. The sharp decline is attributed to the end of work-from-home (WFH) demand and diminishing user appeal for the new specifications (Apple Silicon and Mini-LED). Looking ahead to 2024, Apple's 3nm demand is negatively impacted by the lack of growth drivers for MacBook and iPad.</blockquote>Kuo is essentially saying that Apple will no longer have the growth catalysts that it did over the past few years, such as a pandemic-driven work-from-home boost in demand or the newness of Apple silicon, which spurred many customers to upgrade from Intel-based Macs. However, given Mac and iPad sales already significantly declined in 2023, Apple will at least have more favorable year-over-year sales comparisons in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
It's also worth noting that the next iPad Pro models are expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/ipad-pro-oled-display-mass-production-early-2024/">feature OLED displays</a>, which could be another growth driver for that product line.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo recently said that he <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">does not expect Apple to release any new MacBooks</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">iPads</a> between now and the end of 2023, although it was recently rumored that a new iPad mini is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/">still possible this year</a>. If Kuo is accurate, it is possible that Apple will wait until 2024 to announce the M3 chip, which could result in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/what-to-expect-from-apple-remainder-of-2023/">quiet end to this year</a> for the company.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/kuo-2024-macbooks-ipads-3nm/">Kuo: 2024 MacBooks and iPads to Feature 3nm Chips, But Demand Might Fall Below Expectations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2024-macbooks-and-ipads-to-feature-3nm-chips-but-demand-might-fall-below-expectations.2405084/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On Macs running macOS Sonoma, there is currently a bug that prevents the Apple Configurator app from installing apps on iPhones and iPads, according to a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213912">Apple support document</a>. Apple Configurator is commonly used by IT managers at large businesses and institutions to install apps on iPhones and iPads for employees.<br/>

Apple says the issue will be resolved in future updates to macOS Sonoma and Apple Configurator, but it did not provide a timeframe. In the interim, Apple recommends using a Mac with macOS Ventura or earlier installed, if possible.<br/>
<br/>
macOS Sonoma was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-macos-sonoma/">released on Tuesday</a> following over three months of beta testing. Key new features include interactive desktop widgets, a Game Mode, the ability to add websites to the Dock as web apps, several Safari improvements, and more.

		<title>iPhone 16 Lineup Will Feature A18 and A18 Pro Chips, Analyst Says</title>

		<description><![CDATA[All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
In a research note with investment firm Haitong International Securities this week, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said "we view A17 Pro as a transition design and now expect all the iPhone 16 models to feature A18, on TSMC's N3E."<br/>
<br/>
In response to our email, Pu clarified his expectations, as outlined below:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> A18 chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Plus:</strong> A18 chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro:</strong> A18 Pro chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> A18 Pro chip (N3E)</li></ul>Given the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with the A16 Bionic chip, a jump to the A18 chip for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus would be notable.<br/>
<br/>
N3E refers to TSMC's second-generation 3nm chip fabrication process, which is less expensive and has improved yield compared to TSMC's first-generation 3nm process, N3B, which is used for the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the iPhone 16 lineup is around a year away from launching, Pu is likely making an educated guess here with the marketing names, so it remains to be seen if Apple actually moves forward with A18 and A18 Pro branding. It is still possible that Apple could brand its iPhone 16 chips as the A17 and A18 Pro, mirroring recent years.<br/>
<br/>
Pu was the first source to report that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons-low-chance/">abandoned its plans for solid-state buttons</a> on the iPhone 15 Pro models. He also accurately revealed that the iPhone 15 Pro models would be equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/iphone-15-pro-features-specs-rumors/">increased 8GB of RAM</a>, and that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-15-pro-max-more-expensive/">iPhone 15 Pro Max would have a higher starting price</a> than the iPhone 14 Pro Max.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">iPhone 16 Lineup Will Feature A18 and A18 Pro Chips, Analyst Says</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-lineup-will-feature-a18-and-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says.2405036/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Former Apple design chief Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have been discussing building a new AI hardware device, according to a new report by <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/designer-jony-ive-and-open-ais-sam-altman-discuss-ai-hardware-project">The Information</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/jony-ive-ipad-pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1278" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-824160" /><br/>
Both men have spoken to SoftBank CEO and investor Masayoshi Son about the idea, according to people familiar with the conversations, but it's not clear if he will remain involved. Since leaving Apple, Ive has been concentrating on working for several clients through his British design studio, LoveFrom.<br/>
<br/>
The report is scant on details, and does not reveal anything about what such a device could be, but Ive and Altman are said to be friends and have been discussing "what new hardware for the age of AI could look like," according to one person familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Altman is one of the biggest investors in consumer hardware startup Humane, with was founded by Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, both former Apple employees. The startup plans to develop a screenless wearable device that can be directed using voice prompts and gestures, and projects information onto surfaces in front of it. Chaudhri in May <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMsQO5u7-NQ">demoed</a> a prototype to a TEDTalk audience. Ultimately, Humane plans to integrate OpenAI's technology into the device.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot has made waves in the tech world since it was launched to the public less than a year ago. The company's annual revenue pace has exceeded &#36;1 billion, thanks to ChatGPT subscriptions and paid access to the chatbot's latest and most advanced incarnation, GPT-4. In May 2023, OpenAI released an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/openai-chatgpt-ios-app/">official ChatGPT app</a> for the iPhone and iPad. <br/>
<br/>
For Apple's part, the company has significantly ramped up its spending on artificial intelligence, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">previous report</a> by <em>The Information</em>. Apple's "Foundational Models" team that works on conversational AI includes just 16 people, but Apple is said to be spending millions of dollars per day training its language models, which could one day be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/15/apple-engineers-working-on-chatgpt-like-ai/">integrated into Siri</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/">Jony Ive</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/jony-ive-openai-design-ai-hardware/">Jony Ive Could Develop AI Hardware Device With OpenAI&#039;s Sam Altman</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jony-ive-could-develop-ai-hardware-device-with-openais-sam-altman.2405003/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week, Apple launched the all-new AirPods Pro 2 with the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case. At the same time, we began tracking the first ever discount on the earbuds, and today that &#36;49 markdown is back at Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/AirPods-USB-C-Port-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911675" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the new model of the AirPods Pro 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. Given that the accessory isn't even a week old yet, this is the best deal we've seen so far, and Amazon provides an estimated delivery date of late September/early October.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;199.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset. Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Update 2:</strong> The &#36;199.99 sale price briefly reappeared this afternoon, but has once again expired.

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, Game Mode prioritizes CPU and GPU performance for gaming purposes on Macs. For those unfamiliar with Game Mode, Apple on Tuesday published a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213658">support document</a> providing more information on how to use the new feature. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Mac-Gaming.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899793" /><blockquote>Game Mode optimizes your gaming experience by giving your game the highest priority access to your CPU and GPU, lowering usage for background tasks. And it doubles the Bluetooth sampling rate, which reduces input latency and audio latency for wireless accessories like game controllers and AirPods.</blockquote>Game Mode requires a Mac with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>. Here's how to turn it on in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;.<br/>
<h2>How to Turn on Game Mode</h2><br/>
Game Mode turns on automatically when you use these steps to view your game in full screen:<br/>
<ol><li>Move your pointer over the green button in the upper-left corner of the game window.</li><br/>
<li>Choose Enter Full Screen from the menu that appears.</li></ol>When you enter full screen in this way, a Game mode menu appears in the menu bar. You can use this menu to confirm that Game mode is turned on for your game. <br/>
<br/>

<h2>How to Turn Off Game Mode</h2><br/>
Game Mode turns off automatically when you stop viewing your game in full screen, but you can also turn it off while your game is still in full screen mode: From the Game Mode menu in the menu bar, choose Turn Game Mode off. Note that Game Mode will remain off for the game you were playing until you turn it on again, even if you quit and reopen the game.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Tuesday offered two potential fixes for the recently reported Apple Watch issue where watch face Weather complications fail to load data.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/weather-complications.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913698" /><br/>
Apple Watch owners have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-weather-complication-issues/">complaining</a> of malfunctioning Weather complications since the launch of watchOS 10, with both the initial launch and watchOS 10.0.1 affected. Those impacted are seeing a blank reading where the weather data should be, but tapping into the Weather app shows the expected information.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213943">new support document</a> titled "If the Apple Watch Weather complication isn't working," Apple suggests users affected by the issue try the following:<br/>
<h3>Reset iPhone Settings</h3><br/>
<ol><li>On your iPhone, open the Settings app, then tap Privacy & Security -> Location Services.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap Weather.</li><br/>
<li>Under Allow Location Access, tap Never, then tap your original setting.</li><br/>
<li>Check whether the issue is resolved.</li></ol>If weather data still doesn't load, Apple suggests trying these steps:<br/>
<ol><li>On your iPhone, open the Settings app, then tap General -> Transfer or Reset iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Tap Reset -> Reset Location & Privacy.</li><br/>
<li>If prompted, enter your passcode and reset.</li><br/>
<li>Check whether the issue is resolved.</li></ol>Apple on Tuesday also released a new watchOS 10.0.2 update, which was initially thought to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-0-2-weather-complication-fix/">resolve</a> the Weather complication issue, but it seems that a number of users did not see any permanent resolution after updating.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After three months of beta testing, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> is finally available to everyone. macOS updates often don't get as much attention as iOS updates during the beta testing process, but there are plenty of notable reasons to install the new software.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgeqM3RqhF4" title="macOS Sonoma: Best Features You Need to Know!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
<h2 id="aerial_screensavers">Aerial Screensavers</h2><br/>
If you're a fan of the aerial screensavers on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, you're in luck because Apple brought them to the Mac in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/macos-sonoma-new-aerial-wallpaper.jpg" alt="" width="2381" height="1339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908212" /><br/>
There are more than 100 videos to choose from across categories that include Landscape, Cityscape, Underwater, and Earth. Most of these are from the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, but there are some from the Sonoma region of California that are new this year. The aerial screensavers accompany matching wallpapers that animate when you wake your display for a seamless transition from screensaver to wallpaper.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="interactive_desktop_widgets">Interactive Desktop Widgets</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> aren't constrained to the Today Center in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, and the focus on widgets is perhaps the most notable change in the update. &zwnj;Widgets&zwnj; can be added directly to the desktop, and they are interactive, just like widgets on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-widgets.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900896" /><br/>
You can check off Reminders, control smart home products, and interact with third-party apps from your Mac's desktop without the need to open up the full app. &zwnj;Widgets&zwnj; blend in to the background when not in use, and through Continuity, there's also an option to see and use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; widgets on your desktop without having to install the corresponding Mac app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="videoconferencing">Videoconferencing</h2><br/>
Apple added a Presenter Overlay that is designed to let you share your screen in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> or third-party video apps like Zoom without blocking your face. The feature basically shows you over your background, so you can present and remain on-screen.<br/>
<br/>
For fun, there are also new 3D reactions that pop up with hand gestures during &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; calls and calls in apps like Zoom. Reactions include Love (hearts), Like (thumbs up), Dislike (thumbs down), Balloons, Confetti, Lasers, Fireworks, and Thunderstorm. The gestures that trigger the effect are listed below.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Heart</strong> - Heart emoji</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Thumbs up</strong> - Thumbs up emoji</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Two thumbs up</strong> - Fireworks</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Single thumbs down</strong> - Thumbs down emoji</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Two thumbs down</strong> - Storm</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Peace sign with one hand</strong> - Balloons</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Peace sign with two hands</strong> - Confetti</li><br/>
 <li><strong>"Rock on" sign with two hands</strong> - Lasers</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You will need an Apple silicon Mac to see the reactions, and they can pop up in any app that uses the camera.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="safari_profiles">Safari Profiles</h2><br/>
Safari supports separate profiles, so you can divide work browsing from personal browsing. Profiles have distinct browser history, extensions, Tab Groups, cookies, and favorites.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macOS-Sonoma-Safari-Profiles.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913427" /><br/>
You can create different browsing profiles for any purpose, so it serves as an extension of the Tab Groups feature that came out with macOS Ventura. You can do Work and Personal, separate out hobbies, plan trips with a separate profile, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="web_apps">Web Apps</h2><br/>
A website like MacRumors.com can now be added to the macOS dock as a web app, so you can get to your favorite websites right from the dock. Web apps saved to the dock feature a simplified toolbar and support notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macOS-Sonoma-Web-App-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913423" /><br/>
<h2 id="game_mode">Game Mode</h2><br/>
If you have an Apple silicon Mac you game on, you can turn on Game Mode, which prioritizes CPU and GPU performance for gaming purposes. Game Mode cuts down on audio latency for AirPods and input latency for select game controllers, speeding up your response times.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macos-sonoma-presenter-overlay.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="951" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913860" /><br/>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2><br/>
Compared to macOS Ventura, &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; drops support for the 2017 MacBook Pro, the 2017 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, and the 2017 12-inch MacBook. It can run on the Macs below:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>iMac</strong> - 2019 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>iMac Pro</strong> - 2017 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Mac mini</strong> - 2018 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>MacBook Air</strong> - 2018 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>MacBook Pro</strong> - 2018 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Mac Pro</strong> - 2019 and later</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Mac Studio</strong> - 2022 and later</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-introduces-global-developer-resource-for-labs-sessions-and-workshops/">today announced</a> the launch of a new "Meet with the Apple Experts" resource for developers, providing developers with opportunities to participate in sessions, workshops, labs, and one-on-one meetings hosted by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-developer-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757303" /><br/>
At the current time, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/events/view/upcoming-events/?shouldHideClosedEvents=true">Apple is offering</a> more than 50 workshops and consultations, some of which are hosted online and some of which are in Cupertino. Most of the events are online and are open to developers around the world, but those that involve the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset are available at the Apple Developer Center at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the events include "Explore the highlights from WWDC23," "Explore what's new in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>," "Optimize Your App for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>," and "Get Started with App Discovery and Marketing." Many of the sessions are hosted in different languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese) to make them accessible to developers outside of the United States. Developers can request one-on-one design and technology consultations to get feedback on app design, resolving bugs, and implementing new technologies.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, developers can request a one-on-one App Review consultation to receive advice on how the review process works, how an app can best align with guidelines, and reasons for common rejections. According to the announcement of the new service, developers will be connected with Apple evangelists, engineers, and designers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's sessions begin as soon as September 27, with many dates in October and November.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/meet-with-apple-experts/">Apple Launches &#039;Meet With Apple Experts&#039; Resource for Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-meet-with-apple-experts-resource-for-developers.2404915/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The watchOS 10.0.2 update appears to address a bug with Weather complications, but the issue is only fixed on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, the two devices that are able to receive the new software.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/weather-complications.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913698" /><br/>
Multiple reports <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-watchos-10-0-2-for-apple-watch-ultra-2-and-series-9.2404873/">on the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a> confirm that watchOS 10.0.2 solves the Weather complication bug, but those who do not have an &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; or an &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; will have to wait for Apple to release another watchOS update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch owners <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-weather-complication-issues/">have been complaining</a> of malfunctioning Weather complications since the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, with both the initial launch and watchOS 10.0.1 affected. Those impacted are seeing a blank reading where the weather data should be, but tapping into the Weather app shows the expected information.<br/>
<br/>
Some users have been able to fix the issue by opening up the Watch app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, toggling the 24-Hour Time switch in the Clock app Settings, and waiting a few seconds before toggling it back to the original position. Others have had luck turning off Location Services on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; temporarily and then toggling it back on after a short waiting period.<br/>
<br/>
These solutions have not worked for all users, however, so there may be no fix for everyone affected until another version of watchOS comes out.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update 7:00 p.m.</b>: A number of users who initially saw the complication working properly after updating to watchOS 10.0.2 are once again seeing broken Weather complications, suggesting any fix after the update was temporary at best.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-0-2-weather-complication-fix/">watchOS 10.0.2 Fixes Weather Complication Bug on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 [Update: No]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-0-2-fixes-weather-complication-bug-on-apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-update-no.2404909/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/resident-evil-4.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913940" /><br/>
Resident Evil 4 <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082">can be pre-ordered</a> on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac right now, and under the in-app purchase list, the full unlock is listed for &#36;59.99. An additional DLC pack is priced at &#36;19.99, and several weapon packs are available at prices ranging from &#36;2.99 to &#36;9.99.<br/>
<br/>
Capcom released the Resident Evil 4 remake on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in March. Compared to the original game from 2005, it features overhauled graphics, new characters, and updated gameplay elements such as the option to create items and ammo from resources.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models include an A17 Pro chip that allows for console-quality games to be played on the device. It supports hardware-based ray tracing and has enhanced GPU capabilities to allow for more system-intensive gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Village, Death Stranding, and Assassin's Creed: Mirage are console games that are set to be released on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the future. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are the only iPhones that will be able to run the games, but it will also be playable on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> and later iPads and Macs. <br/>
<br/>
Resident Evil 4's release date has not yet been announced. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/resident-evil-4-iphone-price/">Resident Evil 4 for iPhone Will Cost &#36;60</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resident-evil-4-for-iphone-will-cost-60.2404900/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.gravastar.com/">GravaStar</a> is a small company that designs quirky speakers and unique desktop power adapters, and its latest product, the <a href="https://www.gravastar.com/products/delta35">Delta35 GaN Fast Charger</a>, combines fun and functionality. The Delta35 is a 35-watt power adapter that looks like a little robot.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/gravastar-delta-35-main.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913847" /><br/>
There are two USB-C ports at the top of the power adapter, LED lights that serve as eyes and glow when the adapter is in use, and fold-up prongs for charging at the bottom. GravaStar has also added two ball-jointed ears or antennae, and two ball-jointed arms.<br/>

Both the antennae and the arms can be repositioned and moved around, so the little robot charger can serve as a desktop distraction when it's not in use as a charger. The arms, antennae, and other robotic design elements serve no practical purpose, but they add visual interest to the power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
The two USB-C ports on the Delta35 are at the top of the power adapter. Given this design, it works well plugged into a desktop power strip because that is the ideal orientation of the charger, but it can also be used in the wall. Note that it will look a little odd plugged into the wall because the robot's features will be sideways.<br/>
<br/>
This is a charger that uses Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology as most do these days, so it is compact. It does not take up much room on a desktop and is similar in size to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> charger. While the prongs fold down, the arms and antennae add bulk. Even so, it's still small enough to be tucked into a bag for use as a charger when on the go.<br/>
<br/>

The Delta35 maxes out at 35W, which is enough to charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or MacBook, but it isn't enough capacity to charge multiple devices at their maximum speeds at one time. With just the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> plugged in, the Delta35 is sized for fast charging, and it can deliver a ~50 percent charge in 30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
When two devices are plugged in, the power is split between them with each port receiving 12W, so charging speeds slow down. 35W is on the lower side for a two-port charger, but if you're doing something like charging an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; on your desk throughout the day and don't need power quick, it works out well as a desktop solution.<br/>
<br/>
In my testing, the Delta35 worked as expected, and I appreciated the design, but I do wish it was delivering more power. As it stands, it is appropriate for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and other similar smaller devices, but not more powerful Macs.<br/>
<br/>
I will point out that this is essentially the same as the 35W dual USB-C power adapter that Apple offers alongside the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and charges &#36;59 for. GravaStar's version is cuter and costs a lot less at &#36;30.<br/>
<br/>
The Delta35 GaN Fast Charger can be <a href="https://www.gravastar.com/products/delta35">ordered from the GravaStar website</a> for &#36;29.95. It comes in white and pink and will be shipped starting on October 20.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/gravastar-delta35-fast-charger/">Review: GravaStar&#039;s Unique Robot-Inspired Power Adapter Fast-Charges iPhone and Offers Two USB-C Ports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-gravastars-unique-robot-inspired-power-adapter-fast-charges-iphone-and-offers-two-usb-c-ports.2404889/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-09-25/ai-voice-translation-pilot-lex-fridman-dax-shepard-steven-bartlett/">this week announced</a> an AI translation feature for podcasters that could give it an edge over Apple's podcasting platform. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/0JQ5DAqbMKFFE3WXPvSulX">Voice Translation for podcasts</a> uses artificial intelligence to translate podcasts into additional languages using the original podcaster's voice.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810756" /><br/>
While Spotify developed the tool, it is using OpenAI's latest voice generation technology. It learns the original speaker's voice and style and then translates the podcast into another language. Spotify says that this system will provide a "more authentic listening experience" that is more natural and personal than standard dubbing. Podcasts translated this way will retain the speaker's distinctive speech characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify is testing Voice Translation at the current time, and is working with podcasters like Dax Shepard, Monica Padman, Bill Simmons, Steven Bartlett, and Lex Fridman to create AI-powered voice translations in languages like Spanish, French, and German for both existing episodes and future podcast episodes.<br/>
<br/>
Voice-translated episodes are available worldwide to Premium and Free users. An initial bundle of translated episodes in Spanish are available now, with French and German rolling out "in the coming days and weeks." According to Spotify, the pilot program will provide "important insights" for future expansion and iteration.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple does not have a competing tool at this time for the Podcasts platform, it is experimenting with AI voice technology. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/ios-17-personal-voice/">added a Personal Voice feature</a> that allows you to use AI to create a replica of your voice. Right now, this is an accessibility feature that Apple has designed for those who are at risk of losing their ability to speak, but it stands to reason that Apple could use voice replication in other areas in the future.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/spotify-ai-voice-translation/">Spotify Using AI to Translate Podcasters&#039; Original Voices to Additional Languages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-using-ai-to-translate-podcasters-original-voices-to-additional-languages.2404883/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
