		<description><![CDATA[Black Friday deals have dried up for the most part, but Amazon today has brought back a few all-time low prices on <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHLCYJ7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">numerous Apple Watch Series 10 models</a>. You'll find &#36;69 off both 42mm and 46mm GPS Series 10 models in multiple case colors and band styles, all requiring an on-page coupon in order to see the discount at checkout.<br/>

Every price listed below is a match of the record low prices we saw last week for Black Friday, and in some cases shipping has started slipping closer to the Christmas holiday. If you've been eyeing an Apple Watch Series 10 as a present, now will be the time to purchase one at these best-ever prices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today again said that Apple plans to release its own HomeKit-enabled wireless smart home camera in 2026.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Logitech-Circle-View-Large.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="721" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980756" /><em>Logitech Circle View camera</em></div><br/>
In a <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/smart-home-market-becomes-apples-next-strategic-target-new-homepod-with-display-set-to-be-key-c92f44760a7c">blog post</a> about Apple's smart home plans, Kuo said the camera will have tight integration with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/kuo-homepod-display-coming-late-2025/">rumored HomePod with a display</a>. It is likely that the camera would be sold as an optional accessory alongside the new HomePod hub, providing customers with a home security solution entirely designed by Apple for the first time ever.<br/>
<br/>
Apple would almost certainly tout the privacy and security benefits of its own smart home camera compared to competitors. The company already offers HomeKit Secure Video, which leverages iCloud to securely stream and store video clips from compatible HomeKit cameras, with end-to-end encryption. HomeKit Secure Video cameras can be managed through the Home app on Apple devices, just like other HomeKit accessories. Examples of HomeKit Secure Video cameras include the Logitech Circle View and the Eve Cam.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's smart home camera could also have some additional features not available on third-party HomeKit cameras, but no specifics are known yet.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo expects Apple to begin mass production of the HomePod with a display in the second half of 2025, but he did not provide a release timeframe. He expects the device to feature a 6-7 inch display, an A18 chip, and Apple Intelligence support.<br/>
<br/>
It is not entirely clear if Kuo is referring to the same Apple smart home hub that <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/">as early as March 2025</a>. Gurman said the hub will have around a six-inch display and support Apple Intelligence, so some of the rumored specifications sound the same at the very least. Gurman said the hub can be mounted on a wall, or attached to an optional HomePod-like speaker base. If these rumored devices are one and the same, then a launch might be a little further away than previously expected.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-camera/">Apple Smart Home Camera</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/">Apple Smart Home Display</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/">Apple Again Rumored to Launch Smart Home Camera Alongside HomePod With Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-again-rumored-to-launch-smart-home-camera-alongside-homepod-with-display.2444598/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is struggling to work with Chinese tech company Baidu to bring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> to China next year, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-hits-snags-adapting-baidus-ai-models-for-china-users"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-963902" /><br/>
While it is now available in the United States and several other regions, &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; is not available in China due to the country's restrictive security, privacy, and content obligations, which demands that any public AI technology obtains regulatory approval. This led Apple to partner directly with Baidu, a Chinese company, to deliver &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features in the country expediently.<br/>
<br/>
Citing two individuals said to be familiar with the situation, the report claims that Apple and Baidu are racing to adapt the latter's most advanced large language model, Ernie 4.0, to work well for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users both via the cloud and on-device. Apparently, the models have had difficulty understanding prompts and providing accurate responses to common scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
While Baidu wants results to be driven by data used to train its model, Apple wants it to provide a more personalized answer based on a user's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; usage. Likewise, the two companies have clashed over the use of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user data to train and improve the AI models. Baidu reportedly wants to save and analyze data from &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users, but this is forbidden under Apple's privacy commitments. <br/>
<br/>
The issues are particularly notable since Apple hopes to use &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; to rejuvenate &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales in China, where revenue has declined for three consecutive years due to heightened competition from local smartphone brands such as Huawei that tout a wide array of AI features.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike its collaboration with OpenAI, which reportedly comes at no cost to either company, Apple is actively paying Baidu a fee to use its AI models and has agreed to cover computing costs. Apple already uses Baidu for default search results in Safari and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-struggling-to-adapt-ai-for-china/">Report: Apple Struggling to Adapt Apple Intelligence for China</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-struggling-to-adapt-apple-intelligence-for-china.2444596/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify has made its annual recap feature "<a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/">Spotify Wrapped</a>" available to users on the iOS and Android app. This feature tracks your top artists, genres, songs, podcasts, and minutes listened, and generates graphics for sharing on social media. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/spotify-wrapped-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980702" /><br/>
This year's Spotify Wrapped has a distinctly AI-driven twist: The company has partnered with Google to leverage its note-taking assistant <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com">NotebookLM</a>, which can generate a podcast featuring two artificial hosts that discuss the user's research. In Spotify, the hosts wax lyrical on your top songs, artists, and genre choices for the year.<br/>
<br/>
"Your Wrapped AI Podcast" is available to both free and Premium users in the US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, and Sweden.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify Wrapped also now includes a feature to chart how your musical preferences evolved over the year. For each month it assigns up to three descriptive musical themes, such as "heatwave" or "beach." Additionally, the app creates a personalized “music evolution” playlist, blending your favorite tracks from the year with new songs curated to match your tastes.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, if you're a Premium subscriber, you can create playlists based on your listening habits by prompting Spotify's AI DJ. Other additions this year include the longest listening streak for your top five artists, and an update to the share button that shows whether the audio being shared is in your top 100 songs, top 20 artists, or top five podcasts.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music's equivalent annual recap, Apple Music Replay, was launched on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-music-replay-2024-experience-now-live/">Tuesday</a> for subscribers to the streaming service.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/spotify-wrapped-2024-recap-goes-live/">&#039;Spotify Wrapped&#039; Recaps Your Listening History for 2024 Using AI Hosts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-wrapped-recaps-your-listening-history-for-2024-using-ai-hosts.2444593/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>WIRED</em> today shared in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-tim-cook-wants-apple-to-literally-save-your-life/">in-depth interview</a> with Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, asking questions about AI, Vision Pro sales, pre-recorded keynotes, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Tim-Cook-WWDC-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-955202" /><br/>
<br/>
The wide-ranging interview covers Apple's pivot toward AI technology, including what <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features Cook finds most useful, Apple's partnership with OpenAI, and the environmental impact of AI. For example, <em>WIRED</em> asked Cook about OpenAI's aim to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), full human-level AI software that would be able to learn, understand, and apply knowledge across many domains, and perform tasks they weren't specifically trained for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Right now the technology is good enough where we can deliver it to people and change their lives, and that's what we're focused on. We'll keep pulling the string and see where it takes us.<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
[AGI is] a discussion that we'll continue to have.<br/>

There's so much extraordinary benefit for humanity. Are there some things you have to have guardrails on? Of course. We're very deeply considerate about things that we do and don't do. I hope that others are as well. AGI itself is a ways away, at a minimum. We'll sort out along the way what the guardrails need to be in such an environment.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Cook added that Apple has never considered charging a fee for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, viewing it as a fundamental feature like multitouch. He said Apple sees "the smartphone lasting a very long time," despite the emergence of AI-driven devices. Asked if he was concerned about the amount of time users spend using smartphones, Cook responded:<blockquote>I worry about people endlessly scrolling. That's the reason we do things like Screen Time, to try to guide people. We support people putting limits on themselves, like the number of notifications you get. We do a lot of things in the parental controls area as well. My fundamental belief is, if you're looking at your phone more than you’re looking in somebody's eyes, that's a problem.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Addressing reports that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> has not met sales expectations, Cook said:<blockquote>It's an early adopter product, for people who want tomorrow's technology today. Those people are buying it, and the ecosystem is flourishing. The ultimate test for us is the ecosystem. I don't know if you’re using it very much, but I'm on there all the time. I see new apps all the time.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<em>WIRED</em> also asked Cook if the Vision Pro is ultimately headed toward mixed-reality glasses like Meta and Snap: <blockquote>Yes, it's a progression over time in terms of what happens with form factors. AR is a huge deal. With Vision Pro, we've progressed to what is clearly the most advanced technology we've ever done, and I think the most advanced technology in the world in terms of electronics problems. We'll see where it goes.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Cook answered questions about Apple's move into consumer tools for medical technology on the Apple Watch and AirPods, and alluded to how the the company is researching AI to analyze biometric data in real time:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>I'm not going to announce anything today. But we have research going on. We're pouring all of ourselves in here, and we work on things that are years in the making. We were working on hearing a long time before we got it dialed in to where we felt comfortable shipping it.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
In addition, <em>WIRED</em> queried if Apple will ever return to live presentations:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>During Covid we learned the audience is primarily online. Very few people can fit in the theater, and we wanted to have more people engaged in the announcement itself. You can do that a lot more productively on tape than you can live because of the transitions on stage and so forth.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
However, Cook admitted "I do miss it. I do miss it." He said that he gets asked about how long he sees himself remaining Apple's CEO "now more than I used to," explaining:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>...I'll do it until the voice in my head says, "It's time," and then I'll go and focus on what the next chapter looks like. But it's hard to imagine life without Apple, because my life has been wrapped up in this company since 1998. It's the overwhelming majority of my adult life. And so I love it.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Cook also answered questions about Apple's decision to add the Camera Control to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, working at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a>, the growing regulatory scrutiny the company faces, and Apple's legacy.

		<description><![CDATA[Privacy-focused <a href="https://alohabrowser.com">Aloha Browser</a> has announced a new Cookie Consent Management feature that aims to eliminate repetitive cookie permission pop-ups while maintaining user privacy controls. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/aloha-browser.jpeg" alt="" width="2580" height="1518" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980688" /><br/>
Released today for its iOS app, the new feature allows people to set their cookie preferences once at the browser level rather than responding to prompts on every website.<br/>
<br/>
The new system is designed to address the common frustration with cookie consent banners, which studies show approximately 70% of users either ignore or dismiss without reading. But instead of simply blocking pop-ups, Aloha says its solution actively communicates user preferences to websites through a standardized API.<br/>
<blockquote>"How the industry manages cookie consent is backward and has actually backfired," said Andrew Frost Moroz, Founder of Aloha Browser. "It's time to give users the ability to manage their privacy preferences across the web without being constantly interrupted by cookie pop-ups."</blockquote>The feature offers several preference options, including allowing or rejecting all cookies, creating custom settings for different cookie categories, or setting specific preferences for individual websites. Aloha says these choices are stored securely in the browser and automatically applied across all sites visited. The new feature can be found in Aloha's settings menu under AdBlock ➝ GDPR Consent. <br/>
<br/>
The company presented its new approach to cookie management at the W3C's TPAC 2024 conference, where it reportedly received industry support. Aloha Browser can be found on the App Store [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/aloha-browser-private-vpn/id1105317682">Direct Link</a>], and includes a built-in VPN, ad blocker, privacy reporting, background audio playing support, advanced file management options, and more.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/aloha-browser-end-cookie-prompts/">Aloha Browser Update Promises End to Endless Cookie Prompts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/aloha-browser-update-promises-end-to-endless-cookie-prompts.2444587/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An iPad Pro equipped with Apple's next-generation M5 processor is expected to enter mass production in the second half of next year, according to Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/m4-ipad-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961848" /><br/>
Writing in a <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/byd-electronic-and-tianma-microelectronics-as-key-suppliers-for-apples-smart-home-products-de1b8d079b06">Medium post</a>, Kuo said the primary assembler of the M5 iPad Pro will be China's BYD Electronics, which will also be the exclusive assembler of Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/kuo-homepod-display-coming-late-2025/">display-equipped HomePod</a>, set to be released in late 2025. Apple released the current iPad Pro with OLED display in May 2024, marking the debut of its M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already ordered M5 chips from TSMC as the company begins production development of its next-generation processor, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/29/apple-orders-m5-chips-from-tsmc/">one report</a>. The M5 series is expected to feature an enhanced ARM architecture and will reportedly be manufactured using TSMC's advanced 3-nanometer process technology. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to forgo TSMC's more advanced 2nm process for the M5 chip is believed to be due to cost considerations. However, the M5 will still feature significant advancements over the M4, notably through the adoption of TSMC's System on Integrated Chip (SoIC) technology. <br/>
<br/>
Beyond the processor upgrade, there are currently no other rumors about new features in the M5 iPad Pro, though Apple has said it is considering changing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/27/landscape-apple-logo-possible-on-future-ipads/">rear Apple logo orientation to landscape</a> on future iPads.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m5/">M5</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/m5-ipad-pro-mass-production-late-2025/">M5 iPad Pro to Enter Mass Production in Late 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m5-ipad-pro-to-enter-mass-production-in-late-2025.2444585/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Kuo: New HomePod With Smart Home Display Arriving in Late 2025</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's long-rumored HomePod with a display has been delayed again and is now expected to launch after WWDC 2025, likely in the third quarter of the year, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/smart-home-market-becomes-apples-next-strategic-target-new-homepod-with-display-set-to-be-key-c92f44760a7c">analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. This timeline is a shift from Kuo's earlier prediction of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">2024 release</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Second-Generation-HomePod-With-Top-LCD-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931490" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>MacRumors concept render</em></div><br/>
The new smart speaker is expected to feature Apple's A18 processor and a 6-7 inch display, with support for Apple Intelligence, says the analyst. According to Kuo, the delay is primarily attributed to software development challenges, rather than hardware issues.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors about a ‌HomePod with a display since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/">2021</a>, and Apple actually seems to have several products in the works. Kuo's latest report harks back to previous predictions from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, who suggested Apple was developing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/">several HomePod variants with screens</a>, including one with an iPad-like display and another featuring a screen mounted on a robotic arm. Gurman had indicated these devices were unlikely to launch before 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The new HomePod will reportedly emphasize smart home functionality more than current models, suggesting a strategic repositioning of the product line. The idea that Apple is targeting the smart home market follows a recent report by Gurman about Apple developing an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">all-in-one home management hub</a> with a square-shaped display, thick bezels, and a hemispherical base similar to the iMac G4.<br/>
<br/>
Tianma Microelectronics will be the exclusive panel supplier for the display-equipped HomePod, while BYD Electronics will be the exclusive assembler, according to Kuo. Initial shipment expectations for the new HomePod are relatively modest, with analyst forecasting approximately 500,000 units in the second half of 2025. He also maintains his previous prediction that Apple will launch a compatible smart home IP camera in 2026 that is designed to work wirelessly with the display-equipped HomePod.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/kuo-homepod-display-coming-late-2025/">Kuo: New HomePod With Smart Home Display Arriving in Late 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-new-homepod-with-smart-home-display-arriving-in-late-2025.2444583/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/27/apple-unveils-new-macbook-pros/">the 2016 MacBook Pro models</a>, Apple introduced the Touch Bar, a small multi-touch display available above the keyboard. The Touch Bar replaced the function row of keys and added dynamic buttons that changed for each app, but it was a polarizing feature that many Mac users disliked.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Flexbar -- Your Next Touch-Bar Solution" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fF_qUs6h1U?list=TLGG4NGpxHcFFKIwMzEyMjAyNA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Apple started phasing out the Touch Bar with the launch of the 2021 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models, and the last Mac with a Touch Bar was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/">discontinued in 2023</a>. If you're one of the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; users who misses the Touch Bar, you'll want to take a look at <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1735591421/flexbar-a-versatile-and-fully-customizable-touch-bar-solution">the Flexbar</a>, which is designed to be a Touch Bar replacement.<br/>
<br/>
The Flexbar is a standalone touch-based hardware device that attaches to a Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, or PC over USB-C. It has a customizable, adaptive interface that's modeled after the Touch Bar, and in terms of functionality, it's similar to multi-button PC and Mac add-ons like the Stream Deck.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/flexbar.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1036" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980657" /><br/>
Flexbar features a 10-inch 2K OLED display and it comes equipped with preloaded shortcut combinations and controls tailored for popular apps. It supports third-party APIs and can allegedly offer "advanced, native-like controls" for YouTube, Microsoft apps, Adobe apps, AutoCAD, and more. Flexbar's creators say that a plugin system and marketplace are in development and slated to launch in the second quarter of 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Like the Touch Bar, the Flexbar is designed to automatically switch controls based on your current task window, but users can create their preferred layouts using a "Workspace" recording function. While the Touch Bar was limited to more basic controls, the Flexbar supports multi-step macros and sequences for repetitive tasks.<br/>
<br/>
The Flexbar is a Kickstarter project from a Hong Kong-based company called <a href="https://eniacelec.com">ENIAC</a>, so first and foremost, <em>MacRumors</em> readers should know that ENIAC has not previously created a hardware product. Taking hardware from prototyping to mass production is a difficult task that can lead to delays and even insurmountable issues, plus there are also software integration requirements, so we recommend waiting until the product launches to make a purchase.<br/>
<br/>
It is &#36;120 to back the Flexbar now (shipping not included), and the product has been funded. The Kickstarter page lists an estimated delivery date of February 2025.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/flexbar-touch-bar-replacement/">Miss the MacBook Pro&#039;s Touch Bar?

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a firmware update for the Beats Solo Buds, marking the first new software the earbuds have received since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/beats-solo-buds-launch-date/">their June 2024 launch</a>. The firmware has a build number of 3A130, up from the 3A112 firmware the Solo Buds shipped with.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948605" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
We don't know what's included in the new firmware, and Apple does not typically provide information about Beats firmware updates.<br/>
<br/>
The Beats Solo Buds are priced at &#36;80 and are Apple's smallest and most affordable Beats-branded earbuds. While the earbuds offer a custom-built acoustic architecture and ergonomic design, active noise cancellation is not available.<br/>
<br/>
Firmware updates for Beats headphones are delivered over-the-air. Firmware will be installed while the Beats headphones are charging and are in Bluetooth range of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi.

Dupin said that Amazon's AI chips are "reliable, definite, and able to serve [Apple] customers worldwide." AWS and Amazon have a "strong relationship," and Apple plans to test whether Amazon's Trainium2 chip can be used for pre-training <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> and other AI models. Amazon announced rental opportunities for the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fai%2Fmachine-learning%2Ftrainium%2F">Trainium2 chip</a> today.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has used AWS for more than 10 years for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>. With Amazon's Inferentia and Graviton chips, Apple has seen a 40 percent efficiency gain, and with Trainium2, Dupin said Apple expects up to a 50 percent improvement in efficiency with pre-training.<br/>
<br/>
Nvidia is the market leader when it comes to GPUs for AI training, but companies like Amazon are aiming to compete with lower-cost options.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/">Amazon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-amazon-ai-chips-search/">Apple Uses Amazon&#039;s Custom AI Chips for Search Services</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-uses-amazons-custom-ai-chips-for-search-services.2444550/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of an upcoming visionOS 2.2 update to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/apple-releases-visionos-2-2-beta-3/">third visionOS 2.2 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
visionOS 2.2 can be installed by going to the Software Update section of the Settings app on the Vision Pro and opting into Beta Updates.<br/>
<br/>
The visionOS 2.2 update adds a new feature for the Mac Virtual Display option, allowing it to be set to Wide and Ultrawide. The Ultrawide setting is equivalent to two 4K displays side-by-side, and it is a notable improvement over the current Mac Virtual Display that's available in visionOS 2.1.<br/>
<br/>
The Mac Virtual Display allows the Vision Pro to be connected to a Mac with the Vision Pro serving as the display for the machine. The virtual Mac desktop works just like a standard desktop with an external display, but Vision Pro does not support multiple displays. As a solution, Apple has added the option for a wider display to maximize space.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-seeds-visionos-2-2-beta-4/">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of visionOS 2.2 to Developers With Ultrawide Mac Virtual Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-visionos-2-2-to-developers-with-ultrawide-mac-virtual-display.2444540/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung kicked off its <a href="https://howl.link/0ufxm5ick33dz">Cyber Week sale</a> a few days ago, offering discounts across smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, computers, and home appliances. Many of the deals in this sale are the same prices we tracked during Samsung's Black Friday sale, making Samsung one of the few retailers to keep these best-ever prices around all week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/samsung-best-holiday.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923404" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Right now, Amazon has the 27-inch ViewFinity S9 5K Display at an all-time low price, beating Samsung's Cyber Week deal. You can get this monitor for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0CB71BY87%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26smid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;767.99</strong></a> (&#36;832 off). Another notable Samsung monitor deal is on the 32-inch Smart Monitor M8, available for <a href="https://howl.link/m79zwydm8axba"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a> on Samsung's own website (&#36;300 off).<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.link/0ufxm5ick33dz"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">SITEWIDE DEALS</div>Samsung Cyber Week Sale</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
During this sale, if you purchase a <a href="https://howl.link/ekxaws4sul7id">select Samsung gaming monitor</a>, you'll also get the 27-inch Odyssey G3 Gaming Monitor for free (&#36;229.99 value). One of the best monitors to purchase with this offer is the 57-inch Odssey Neo G9 Curved Gaming Monitor for <a href="https://howl.link/ezd2zzv2k1wyv"><strong>&#36;1,599.99</strong></a> (&#36;1,129.99 off).<br/>
<br/>
Other than monitors and TVs, we're also now tracking quite a few deals on refrigerators, tablets, and computers below. These sale prices will be live for this week only, so be sure to check out Samsung's event before the best prices of the year disappear.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, introduced on March 8, 2022, has now reached the milestone of being <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#ios">over 1,000 days old</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/iphone-se-3-stage.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="893" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-838833" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; debuted in 2016 as Apple's answer to customers who wanted a more affordable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> without sacrificing key features. The first SE model was based on the design of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5s but packed the then-flagship A9 chip and latest camera technology. Subsequent iterations followed a similar formula: the second-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; in 2020 adopted the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8's design and added the A13 Bionic chip, while the third generation launched in 2022 with another leap in processing power thanks to the A15 Bionic chip. Over the years, the SE line has become synonymous with classic design paired with modern internals.<br/>
<br/>
When the third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; was unveiled, it brought significant upgrades over its predecessor, including the A15 Bionic chip—the same processor used in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 lineup—longer battery life, and 5G connectivity, which extended high-speed wireless access to Apple's budget-conscious customers. However, the exterior design was starting to show its age even upon the device's unveiling in 2022. The third-generation SE retained the 4.7-inch Retina HD display and thick bezels of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8, a design that effectively first debuted in 2014 on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6. Likewise, its LCD screen felt out of step with Apple's more modern OLED displays. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> was also noticeably absent.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/iphone-se-2.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-841335" /><br/>
As the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3 crosses the 1,000-day threshold, there are a vast array of corroborated rumors about its successor. Expected to launch in the spring of 2025, the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is shaping up to be a significant upgrade. Unlike its two predecessors, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is rumored to abandon the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8's design entirely in favor of a modern aesthetic inspired by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The new model is expected to feature a larger 6.1-inch OLED display to provide deeper blacks, better contrast, and improved energy efficiency. &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; is also set to replace <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, marking the end of the physical Home button on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and embracing the all-screen design that has become a hallmark of contemporary iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Under the hood, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is anticipated to be powered by the A18 Bionic chip, the same processor from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, along with 8GB of RAM to support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>. Another major change will be the adoption of USB-C, following Apple's broader transition away from the Lightning connector. Camera upgrades are also on the horizon, with the SE 4 likely to feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, a dramatic improvement over the 12-megapixel sensor in the SE 3. Despite these substantial upgrades, Apple is reportedly committed to keeping the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 priced below &#36;500, maintaining its appeal as an affordable entry point into the Apple ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
For those considering the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3 today, the advice is clear: wait. While the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3 remains a capable device, it is difficult to justify its purchase when a redesigned, feature-packed successor is on the horizon. The dated design and hardware limitations of the current model make it markedly less future-proof compared to Apple's other offerings. With the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 expected to deliver a more modern design with a larger display, OLED technology, &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, faster performance, and other improved features at a similar price point, holding out for its release in 2025 is by far the smartest choice.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/iphone-se-now-over-1000-days-old/">iPhone SE Now Over 1,000 Days Old as New Model Edges Closer</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-now-over-1-000-days-old-as-new-model-edges-closer.2444529/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has significantly hiked its investment proposal to Indonesia and is now offering &#36;1 billion in a bid to resolve the ongoing iPhone 16 sales ban in the country, according to the country's investment minister Rosan Roeslani (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/indonesia-expects-1-bln-investment-commitment-apple-a-week-minister-says-2024-12-03/">Reuters</a></em>). <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-16-Apple-Store.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976828" /><br/>
Speaking to lawmakers on Tuesday, Roeslani said the government expects to receive a written commitment from Apple within a week. "Whoever benefits from the sales must invest here, create jobs here," he added. The investment is described as a "first phase" of Apple's potential involvement in the country. The offer marks a tenfold increase from Apple's previous proposal earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
The negotiation stems from Indonesia's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/indonesia-bans-iphone-16-sales/">October ban on iPhone 16 sales</a> after authorities determined Apple had not met the country's requirement for 40% domestic content in smartphones. The government previously rejected Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/indonesia-iphone-ban-apple-10m-investment/">initial &#36;10 million offer</a>, followed by a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ups-invest-offer-indonesia-iphone-16-ban/">&#36;100 million proposal</a> that included plans for research and development facilities and developer academies.<br/>
<br/>
The government is particularly interested in having Apple establish local manufacturing partnerships and source components domestically. Apple has maintained developer academies in Indonesia since 2018, but the country currently hosts no Apple manufacturing facilities. Apple has not responded to requests for comment regarding the latest investment proposal.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/">Indonesia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-raises-indonesia-investment-offer-iphone-ban/">Apple Raises Indonesia Investment Offer to &#36;1B Amid iPhone Ban</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-raises-indonesia-investment-offer-to-1b-amid-iphone-ban.2444516/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A UK class action lawsuit against Apple over App Store commission fees will proceed after judges dismissed the company's attempt to block the case, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-03/apple-faces-uk-class-action-over-app-store-commission-charges">Bloomberg</a></em> reports. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/app-store-blue-banner-uk-fixed.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804521" /><br/>
Led by competition policy professor Sean Ennis, the suit alleges Apple's 15-30% commission on App Store sales creates an anti-competitive tax on the UK technology industry. The lawsuit seeks £785 million (&#36;995 million) in damages on behalf of UK app developers. The case could potentially benefit up to 13,000 developers who have sold apps or in-app subscriptions to iOS users since July 2017.<br/>
<br/>
The lawsuit follows similar challenges worldwide over Apple's App Store policies. Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-eu-app-ecosystem-tidbits/">January</a> announced changes to its App Store terms in response to European Union regulations, but these modifications have also faced criticism from EU watchdogs for potentially making conditions worse for developers.<br/>
<br/>
This latest legal challenge expands on a previous suit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-uk-antitrust-lawsuit-app-store-fees/">filed last year</a>, which initially represented around 1,500 UK developers. Professor Ennis, who previously worked at the U.S. Department of Justice and European Commission, secured funding for the case through Harbour Litigation Funding.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has consistently defended its App Store practices, maintaining that most developers pay no commission and that the platform provides valuable security and development resources. The company also emphasizes that developers can reach users through web browsers, where Apple's rules don't apply.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-fails-block-uk-app-store-lawsuit/">Apple Fails to Block &#36;995M UK App Store Commission Lawsuit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-fails-to-block-995m-uk-app-store-commission-lawsuit.2444515/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In watchOS, the Smart Stack for your Apple Watch is pretty clever. The collection of widgets can be pulled up with a scroll of the Digital Crown, and shows you relevant information throughout your day. But sometimes, its eagerness to help can be a bit much, especially when it comes to Live Activities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/live-activities-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980591" /><br/>
You're probably familiar with this scenario: You raise your wrist expecting to see your carefully customized watch face, but it's been replaced by media playback controls because someone's watching your Apple TV, or there's a delivery tracking screen showing that you aren't currently interested in. Live Activities in the Smart Stack can clearly be useful, but having them automatically take over your display isn't always ideal. Here's how to take back control:<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open Settings on your Apple Watch.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Smart Stack</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Select <strong>Live Activities</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Toggle off the switch next to <strong>Auto-Launch Live Activities</strong>.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/watchos-live-activities.jpg" alt="settings" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980580" /><br/>
<br/>
After disabling auto-launch, Live Activities will still be available in your Smart Stack when you want them – you'll just need to manually scroll to see them instead of having them pop up automatically.<br/>
<br/>
If you want more granular control, you're in luck. From the same settings screen you can control which Apple apps display Live Activities. Using the Watch app on your iPhone, you can also manage Live Activities settings for third-party apps. This lets you keep the notifications you find useful while preventing the less important ones from interrupting your watch face.<br/>
<br/>
Pro Tip: If it's just those persistent media controls that bug you, head to <strong>Media Apps</strong> in the same settings menu and turn off <strong>Live Activities</strong> completely, or alternatively under "Auto-Launch," select <strong>Off</strong> or <strong>Smart Stack</strong> for a more focused watch face experience.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/stop-live-activities-apple-watch-display/">Stop Live Activities Taking Over Your Apple Watch Face</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/stop-live-activities-taking-over-your-apple-watch-face.2444513/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
