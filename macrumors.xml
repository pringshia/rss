		<description><![CDATA[Apple is ending its credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs, according to <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/apple-pulls-plug-on-goldman-credit-card-partnership-ca1dfb45">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>. Apple plans to stop working with Goldman Sachs in the next 12 to 15 months, and it is not yet clear if Apple has established a new partnership for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785924" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-card-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
Apple and Goldman Sachs will dissolve their entire consumer partnership, including the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; and the Apple Savings account.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors earlier this year suggested that Goldman Sachs wanted to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/goldman-sachs-apple-partnership-amex/">get out of its relationship</a> with Apple as part of a plan to cut back on its consumer business. Goldman Sachs at the time was said to be speaking with American Express about a possible takeover, but the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; needs to run on the Mastercard network until 2026 due to a deal established between Apple and Goldman Sachs. Amex also had concerns about aspects of the program such as loan loss rates due to Apple's push to have customers approved, so the status of the talks is not known.<br/>
<br/>
Synchrony Financial, known as the largest issuer of store credit cards, has considered taking over the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, according to <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em>. <br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs and Apple have worked together on the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; since it launched in 2019, and have also teamed up for the high-yield Apple Savings account and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> Later feature. The partnership <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-goldman-sachs-apple-card-issues/">has not gone smoothly</a>, with Goldman Sachs running into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-goldman-sachs-apple-card-issues/">customer service issues</a> due to long wait times for disputed &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; transactions and issues with the Apple Savings account.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-fed-probes-goldman-sachs-consumer-business-wsj-2023-01-20/">launched an investigation</a> into Goldman Sachs due to the customer complaints, leading to tension with Apple. Apple is unhappy with the customer service reputation of its &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; and Apple Savings products, while some Goldman Sachs executives blame Apple for the regulatory scrutiny. <br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs was new to consumer banking when the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; launched, and to establish a deal with Apple, it is not collecting fees that many credit card issuers receive. The bank does not get a cut of the fee that merchants pay to Apple to accept the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, nor is it able to collect annual fees, late fees, or foreign transaction fees. Goldman Sachs does earn money from loans issued to cardholders who split Apple purchases into installments, but it is not known if Apple will be able to establish a similar deal with another issuer because of the limited revenue the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; provides. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">Apple Ending Apple Card Partnership With Goldman Sachs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ending-apple-card-partnership-with-goldman-sachs.2412297/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is wrapping up development on iOS 17.2, with the update expected to come out in December. While we're getting to the end of the beta testing period, Apple is still tweaking features and adding new functionality.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918854" /><br/>
We've rounded up everything new in the fourth beta of iOS 17.2.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Default Notification Sound</h2><br/>
Under Sounds & Haptics, there's a new "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" /><br/>
All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound, plus there is an option to also change the haptic vibration of default notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Collaborative Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
While collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists were introduced in an earlier version of iOS 17.2, Apple has removed the option in the fourth beta, which suggests this is not an option that will be coming in iOS 17.2 after all.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="5484" height="3085" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918890" /><br/>
<h2>AppleCare Settings</h2><br/>
The "Coverage" section under Settings > General has been renamed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> & Warranty. It still includes &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; info for your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and connected devices such as the Apple Watch and AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/applecare-warranty-ios-17-2.jpg" alt="" width="2452" height="1379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924448" /><br/>
Under General > About there's a new Warranty section that provides coverage information for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Recording to an External Device</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, ProRes video can be recorded directly to an external device. iOS 17.2 appears to include a new pop up message that lets users know that external recording is not working because of a USB-C cable that is too slow.<br/>
<br/>
There was previously a warning about an external storage device not having a fast enough write speed to support external recording, but now there is an added message about the write speed of the USB-C cable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iTunes</h2><br/>
Code in iOS 17.2 confirms that Apple is planning to eliminate the option to purchase TV shows and movies in the iTunes app. TV and movie content will need to be purchased in the TV app in the future, but for now, the change has not actually been implemented.<br/>
<br/>
"You can buy or rent TV shows and find your purchases in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app," reads the code.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy's Cyber Monday sale has transitioned into a <a href="https://howl.me/ck6b1vcE1Me">"Holiday Deals" event</a> that's promising new discounts and offers every day for the next 20 days. For today, the focus is on a few laptop deals, including the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/best-buy-cyber-week.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924428" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
As with the Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals we saw, some of the discounts below require a <a href="https://howl.me/ck6bXDtyIMr">My Best Buy Plus or My Best Buy Total membership</a>. These start at &#36;49.99/year and grant members early access to sales, exclusive discounts on select products, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ck6b1vcE1Me"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">Sitewide Sale</div>Best Buy Holiday Deals Event</div></a></div><h2>MacBook Air</h2><br/>

<br/>
The highlight of the sale is Apple's 256GB 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air for <a href="https://howl.me/ck6bCMrS1iS"><strong>&#36;949.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,099.00. Best Buy has this sale price in all four colors, and it represents a solid second-best price on the 2022 notebook.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-releases-ios-17-2-beta-4/">fourth beta of iOS 17.2</a> that Apple released today adds a much-desired feature, the option to change the default notification alert.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" /><br/>
Under Sounds & Haptics, there's a new "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has not previously offered an interface for tweaking the default notification sound, so this is a notable update for those who have always wanted to select a sound. All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">iOS 17.2 beta 4 allows you to change the default notification sound and haptic <a href="https://t.co/f7Vxny3Jcc">pic.twitter.com/f7Vxny3Jcc</a></p>&mdash; iSoftware Updates (@iSWUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1729568826751152479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the fourth betas of upcoming iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming two weeks after Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-beta-3-to-developers/">the third of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918852" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Cool.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest new feature in iOS 17.2 is the Journal app, which can be used to record daily activities and thoughts. You can write about your day to day life, but Apple also provides topic suggestions based on the music you listen to, the places you visit, and the people you see. Journal entries support pictures, voice recordings, and location information, with the app organized by entry date.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, there's a Favorites playlist that houses everything you've favorited, plus Apple added support for collaborative playlists. You can now share a playlist with multiple people, and each participant can add songs.<br/>
<br/>
Stickers can now be used to reply to iMessages when you long press on a chat bubble in the Messages app, and there's also now support for the extra-secure iMessage Contact Key Verification option. If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the Action Button supports Translate in iOS 17.2, and there are new Weather and Clock widgets.<br/>

<br/>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.2‌ update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌ can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.2 adds support for iMessage Contact Key Verification, a feature designed for those who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials.<br/>
<br/>
Users can ensure that there is no "man in the middle" snooping on iMessage conversations, and there is a Contact Verification Code so that iMessage users can verify that they're speaking to the correct individual during in-person meetings or on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.2 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes, but tvOS 17.2 introduces an overhauled &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
The app now includes a sidebar that houses content from both Apple's services and streaming services that integrate with the tvOS Watch Now feature. There are dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>‌, MLS Season Pass, Sports, the Store, and the Library at the top of the sidebar, along with dedicated sections for streaming services like ABC, CBS, Comedy Central, Hulu, ESPN, Discovery, Peacock, Prime Video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
You can click into each streaming service to see content that's available specifically on that service, and there's also a new My TV section that replaces "My Channels."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-beta-4-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of tvOS 17.2 to Developers [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-tvos-17-2-to-developers-update-public-beta-available.2412267/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At WWDC in June 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">previewed the next generation of CarPlay</a>, promising deeper integration with vehicle functions like A/C and FM radio, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, increased personalization, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/All-New-CarPlay-Five-New-Features-Article-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918156" /><br/>
Apple's website <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">still says</a> the first vehicles with support for the next-generation CarPlay experience will be announced in "late 2023," but it has not shared any additional details heading into the final month of the year, so it's unclear if that timeframe will still be met. We have reached out to Apple for an update on the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we have recapped five key features to expect from the new version of CarPlay. Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Porsche, Volvo, and a few others.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay Features</h2><br/>
<h3>Instrument Cluster Integration</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Multi-Display-CarPlay-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="896" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848187" /><br/>
The new CarPlay experience will provide integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, including the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, fuel gauge, engine temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge, and more. Apple says drivers will be able to choose from several gauge cluster designs and layouts, including brand‑specific options.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Climate Controls</h3><br/>

You'll be able to access your vehicle's climate controls directly within the new version of CarPlay, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heat, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and other options.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Multi-Display Support</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Multi-Screens.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878824" /><br/>
The new version of CarPlay will be able to appear across all of the displays in a vehicle, providing a consistent experience across the infotainment system, instrument cluster, and any additional screens on the dashboard. Apple says CarPlay will be tailored to each new vehicle model to accommodate unique screen shapes and layouts. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Widgets</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Widgets.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878821" /><br/>
Widgets will be a key part of the new CarPlay experience, offering at-a-glance information such as trip duration, fuel economy, distance traveled, calendar events, weather, phone calls, the status of a HomeKit-enabled garage door, and more. It will also be possible to view and scroll through the widgets within the instrument cluster.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>FM Radio App</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Radio.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="899" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878822" /><br/>
The new version of CarPlay will include an all-new Radio app that allows you to easily control the FM radio in your vehicle, such as to change the station.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>CarPlay on iOS 17</h2><br/>
In the meantime, CarPlay includes a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/whats-new-carplay-ios-17/">handful of new features and changes</a> when used with an iPhone running iOS 17, including SharePlay support in the Music app for passengers and real-time electric vehicle charging station availability.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-unveils-the-top-books-of-2023-and-a-new-year-in-review-experience/">announced</a> that its Books app now offers a "Year in Review" recap in select countries, including the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, France, and Germany. The feature requires an iPhone or iPad on iOS 17.1 or iPadOS 17.1 or later, and it can be found within the Read Now tab under Top Picks, for users with at least three titles marked as finished.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Books-Year-in-Review.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="735" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924332" /><br/>
Year in Review allows Apple Books users to view personalized highlights about the books and audiobooks they read in 2023, including their total time spent reading, the longest book or audiobook they read, their most-read author and genre, their highest-rated book, and more. The recap can easily be shared with others.<br/>
<br/>
How to mark books or audiobooks as finished:<blockquote>To add books or audiobooks, readers can tap and hold on any book in the app and choose Mark as Finished. To change the finished date shown, users can hold down on the book and select Edit Finished Date. For titles read elsewhere, such as in hardcover or paperback, users can search for them in Apple Books and select Mark as Finished to add them to their Year in Review.</blockquote>When the "Reading Goals" option is turned on in the Settings app, under Books, users can also view their longest reading streak, the average number of minutes they spent reading in a month, and other statistics in Year in Review.<br/>
<br/>

Year in Review can determine a user's personal reading type:<blockquote>There are six reader types to discover, including The Contemporary for readers of trendy titles; The Completist for readers of multiple books in a series; The Seeker for nonfiction readers; The Wanderer for multigenre readers; The Deep Diver for single-genre readers; or The Free Spirit for readers with wide-ranging interests across the book world.</blockquote>Apple also shared the most popular books in the Books app in 2023:<blockquote><strong>Top Nonfiction Books of 2023</strong><br/>
1. <em>Spare</em> by Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex<br/>
2. <em>The Woman in Me</em> by Britney Spears<br/>
3. <em>The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder</em> by David Grann<br/>
4. <em>Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity</em> by Peter Attia and Bill Gifford<br/>
5. <em>Elon Musk</em> by Walter Isaacson<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Top Fiction Books of 2023</strong><br/>
1. <em>Fourth Wing</em> by Rebecca Yarros<br/>
2. <em>Iron Flame</em> by Rebecca Yarros<br/>
3. <em>Happy Place</em> by Emily Henry<br/>
4. <em>Hello Beautiful</em> by Ann Napolitano<br/>
5. <em>The Covenant of Water</em> by Abraham Verghese</blockquote>As the end of 2023 nears, Apple has started sharing year-end content, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-announces-app-store-award-finalists-2023/">award-winning apps</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-reveals-most-popular-podcasts-of-2023/">the most popular podcasts</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today rolled out the <a href="https://replay.music.apple.com/">Apple Music Replay</a> experience for 2023, allowing subscribers to see their top artists, songs, albums, genres, playlists, and stations of the year. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Music-Replay-23-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924302" /><br/>
Users can watch a custom Highlight Reel at the top of the Replay webpage before diving into more detailed information and expanded listening insights. The highlight reel presents a series of social media-style animated cards that show musical highlights from the past year based on your listening history. Relevant music plays in the background for each card. The highlight reel is viewable on desktop browsers, but it appears to be primarily designed for mobile devices.<br/>
<br/>
After the highlight reel, users can scroll down to see featured sections with more informative breakdowns of their top albums and playlists from the past year. Users can add their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Replay 2023 playlist to the Music app at the bottom of the page.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has made some changes to the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Replay experience for 2023, including a darker color palette and new animations in the Highlight Reel. Milestones also can now be viewed on iOS and Highlight sides can be shared directly to social media platforms for the first time. Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/29/apple-music-replay-2022-revamped/">revamped the Apple Music Replay experience</a> by introducing the Highlight Reel and a series of other improvements.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Replay is Apple's answer Spotify Wrapped, but &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Replay remains a web browser only experience. The Music app itself can only show and play a basic playlist of your top songs for the year, ranked by most played, once it has been added via the Replay webpage.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Work on multiple next-generation Vision Pro headsets is ongoing, according to two new reports coming out of Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231127PD223.html">DigiTimes</a></em> claims that there are a total of four different second-generation Vision Pro headsets in development, including a direct successor to the first-generation model and a more affordable model. The nature of the other two second-generation models is unclear. <br/>
<br/>
The bill of materials (BOM) for the more affordable headset will reportedly be half that of the first-generation Vision Pro to enable a significantly reduced retail price. Samples of this device are apparently set to begin production in the second half of 2024, with launch following in the second half of 2025 at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
According to a separate report from <a href="https://www.jiemian.com/article/10448655.html"><em>Interface News</em></a>, Apple has begun to communicate with its supply chain about second- and third-generation Vision Pro products, seeking to reduce costs to bring down prices and boost sales in the future. <em>Interface News</em> also claims that mass production of the first-generation Vision Pro will begin in December with an initial batch of 400,000 units. Apple apparently has a sales target of about one million units for 2024. <br/>
<br/>
The first-generation Vision Pro headset is due to launch early next year in the United States with a starting price of &#36;3,499.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Drive users have been warned not to disconnect their account within the Google Drive for desktop app, after a spate of reports of files going missing from the cloud service.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/Google-Drive.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="840" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847028" /><br/>
Alarm bells began ringing last week on Google's community support site when some users reported files <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606/google-drive-files-suddenly-disappeared-the-drive-literally-went-back-to-condition-in-may-2023?hl=en">mysteriously disappearing</a> from Google Drive, with some posters claiming six or months of data had vanished.<br/>
<br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/27/google_drive_files_disappearing/">The Register</a></em>, one user logged into Google Drive to find things as they were in May 2023, with everything saved since that date gone, despite attempts by Google's support team to help them recover the files. Currently, the thread of complaints has 217 users who clicked the "I have the same question."  <br/>
<br/>
The Google Drive team has since <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245861992/drive-for-desktop-v84-0-0-0-84-0-4-0-sync-issue">posted</a> that it is "investigating reports of an issue impacting a limited subset of Drive for desktop users." In the meantime:<br/>
<ul><li>Do not click "Disconnect account" within Drive for desktop</li><br/>
<li>Do not delete or move the app data folder:<br/>
<strong>Windows:</strong> %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\DriveFS<br/>
<strong>macOS:</strong> ~/Library/Application Support/Google/DriveFS</li></ul><br/>
Google also recommends making a copy of the app data folder if there's space on your hard drive, until the sync issue is resolved. We'll update this article if we hear more. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-drive/">Google Drive</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/google-drive-files-going-missing/">Some Google Drive Users&#039; Files Have Mysteriously Vanished</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-google-drive-users-files-have-mysteriously-vanished.2412233/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> doesn't have a fan, and instead uses a passive heat spreader to conduct heat away from Apple's energy efficient <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. Curious to know if performance could be further improved with an active cooling solution, <a href="https://www.froresystems.com">Frore Systems</a> installed its own novel solid-state active cooling system into the laptop and subjected it to several benchmarks, with some impressive results.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/15inch-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916649" /><br/>
Frore Systems is a startup with &#36;116 million in funding, and its flagship product is the AirJet Mini, a virtually silent thermal solution with a piezoelectric cooling chip that its makers claim performs better than fans. Inside the AirJet are tiny membranes that vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies, pulling air into inlet vents at the top of the AirJet that exits through the bottom as high-velocity pulsating jets.<br/>
<br/>
As shared by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/27/23975368/frore-airjet-apple-macbook-air-fanless-mems">The Verge</a></em>, head-to-head benchmarking tests initially showed the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with the AirJet Mini installed performed only slightly better than a standard &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, but the modified laptop pulled ahead significantly as the tests wore on and the fanless &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s throttling kicked in to keep the temperature down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/airjet_mini_frore_difference.jpg.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="701" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924275" /><br/>
Despite its slight dimensions, the 2.8mm thick AirJet took some work to install into the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s slim chassis. Frore had to mill 0.3mm off from the laptop's lid to create adequate space for the airflow system, and also removed the speakers, Wi-Fi antenna, and internal keyboard connector in the process. For the rest of us, buying a MacBook Pro with a fan is definitely an easier option.<br/>
<br/>

Another issue that wasn't addressed in the tests was the real-world impact of such a system on battery life. <em>The Verge</em> says the AirJet Mini drew five watts from the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s USB-C port in the makeshift setup. Frore says its AirJet Mini chips require one watt of power when properly integrated into a laptop, and the system draws as little as 0.1W or 0.2W when idle, with the AirJet Minis themselves staying turned off until or unless they need to blow. <br/>
<br/>
The AirJet system will debut in a &#36;499 barebones Zotac mini-PC that requires constant connection to a power source, a use case in which battery life won't be an issue. But the startup has also prototyped 4K webcams, doorbell cameras, LED light bulbs, and more. It's too early to tell whether Frore's cooling system will be the next big thing in PC cooling tech, but the startup says the AirJet Mini is already in mass production, with larger and smaller versions in development.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/m2-macbook-air-speed-boost-frore-fan/">M2 MacBook Air Gets Speed Boost With This Novel Cooling System</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m2-macbook-air-gets-speed-boost-with-this-novel-cooling-system.2412230/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple with iOS 17.1 and watchOS 10.1 introduced a new NameDrop feature that is designed to allow users to place Apple devices near one another to quickly exchange contact information. Sharing contact information is done with explicit user permission, but some news organizations and police departments have been spreading misinformation about how functions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/ios-17-namedrop.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900409" /><br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/27/namedrop-iphone-ios17-safety/">The Washington Post</a></em>, there have been warnings about NameDrop popping up on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>. Police departments in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio, and other states have been suggesting that contact information can be shared "just by bringing your phones close together." From the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChesterPolicePA">City of Chester Police Department</a> in Ohio:<blockquote>IMPORTANT PRIVACY UPDATE: If you have an iPhone and have done the recent iOS 17 update, they have set a new feature called NameDrop defaulted to ON. This feature allows the sharing of your contact info just by bringing your phones close together. To shut this off go to Settings, General, AirDrop, Bringing Devices Together. Change to OFF.</blockquote><br/>
While it's true that NameDrop is turned on by default, the way that it functions is more nuanced than simply putting two iPhones near each other.<br/>
<br/>
NameDrop works when two iPhones running iOS 17.1 or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with iOS 17.1 and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 are placed right next to each other, as in almost touching. When the two devices come in close contact and both are unlocked, there is a pop up prompting users to share contact information or an image.<br/>
<br/>
Contact information is not shared automatically, and it is a user-initiated process that requires both people exchanging information to accept the transfer. While an accidental exchange could occur, it would require a user to unlock their device and accept the sharing prompt for that to occur.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple police departments posted the warning above, which was widely shared on Facebook and other social networks. The message from the Noble County Sheriff's Office in Ohio, for example, got upwards of 70,000 shares, while the Dewey Police Department in Pennsylvania's warning was shared 11,000 times. After criticism from some commenters, Noble County edited its message to clarify that there's a popup to transfer content, and Dewey County said that it was attempting to "get parents engaged with their children," but many people who saw the original post may not see the updates.<br/>
<blockquote>The intent of the post was to get parents engaged with their children and what they are doing on their devices, not the fear mongering as suggested. We suggest everyone do research on new technology and updates to learn more about what is out there, especially for kids</blockquote><br/>
Several local news stories have also shared similar questionable NameDrop information. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/new-iphone-feature-namedrop-is-on-by-default/">KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh</a>, for example, interviewed several people and included quotes suggesting NameDrop happens automatically.<blockquote>"That's why I turned it off because I don't have a use for it. I don't even have my phone at work so I don't really have a use for it. But I guess a default on could be a bit controversial just because I think giving out your contact should be a conscious decision and not something that could accidentally happen," Jerry said.<br/>
<br/>
"That is a little bit concerning, I think it should be an optional feature instead of automatically happening," said Liz Jones.</blockquote><br/>
If anything, NameDrop has the potential to be more irritating than dangerous, simply because it's likely to activate when your phone is next to someone else's and unlocked, in a situation like a dinner or meeting. Given the negative feedback, Apple may in a future update turn NameDrop off by default, but those who want to disable it now can do so by opening up the Settings app, going to the General section, tapping AirDrop, and turning off "Bringing Devices Together."<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/27/ios-17-namedrop-misinformation/">Police Departments and News Sites Spreading Misinformation About How iOS 17 NameDrop Feature Works</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/police-departments-and-news-sites-spreading-misinformation-about-how-ios-17-namedrop-feature-works.2412190/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in October refreshed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and MacBook Pro, introducing the first M3 chips with 3-nanometer processors. We've already checked out the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/m3-macbook-pro-hands-on/">MacBook Pro with M3 Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/m3-max-macbook-pro-hands-on/">MacBook Pro with M3 Max</a>, so we thought we'd wrap up our M3 review series with the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>

If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, you're not going to notice any physical differences between the old model and the new model with the M3 chip, because Apple didn't make any updates to the design or the color offerings.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is the exact same, with the thin design, 24-inch Retina display, six-speaker sound system, and a selection of seven two-tone color options.<br/>
<br/>
What's different is the internals, and the jump from &zwnj;M1&zwnj; to M3 is a major update in terms of CPU and GPU speeds. Built on the 3-nanometer process, the M3 chip has some major GPU improvements thanks to Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and mesh shading.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 chip is 2.5x faster than the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip when it comes to GPU performance, and it's better than before for gaming, 3D rendering, video editing, and similar tasks. As for the CPU, the performance cores are up to 30 percent faster than the performance cores in the &zwnj;M1&zwnj;, while the efficiency cores are up to 50 percent faster than the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; efficiency cores. In Geekbench benchmarks, the M3 comes in at around 20 percent faster overall.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on what you're doing, there is a notable difference between the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and M3 in real-world performance and it's great to have an update for a machine that was one of the oldest in Apple's lineup. If you need a desktop Mac for day-to-day tasks, you're not going to be disappointed with the M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
If you're holding out for a larger &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with Apple silicon, Apple doesn't think you should wait. The company confirmed there are no plans <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">for another 27-inch iMac</a>, and Apple recommends that customers who need a bigger and better desktop computer turn to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> and the Studio Display.<br/>
<br/>
That said, there are rumors that Apple is working on an &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; that has a display somewhere around 30 inches, but it's not yet clear when that model might be coming out, and it seems to be at least a year or two away.<br/>
