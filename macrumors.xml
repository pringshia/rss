		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> is widely rumored to feature an all-new titanium frame. Over the past several months, a variety of credible sources such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/iphone-15-pro-10-percent-lighter-report/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/iphone-15-pro-features-specs-rumors/">Apple analyst Jeff Pu</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/21/iphone-15-titanium-curved-rear-edges/">leaker ShrimpApplePro</a>, have all claimed that Apple would be switching to titanium for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, finally replacing stainless steel.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Pro-Blue-Front-Perspective-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905593" /><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> has confirmation that Apple intends to use Grade 5 Titanium as the exact material for the chassis of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and the larger &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. <br/>
<br/>
Grade 5 Titanium, also known as Ti-6Al-4V, is a titanium alloy consisting of titanium along with small amounts of aluminum and vanadium. Most commonly known for its excellent corrosion resistance, Grade 5 Titanium is used in a wide variety of industries, including aerospace, racing, and prosthetics manufacturing. The light weight, strength, and hardness of the material could explain why Apple decided to use Grade 5 Titanium for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has a history of using titanium for its products – from the PowerBook G4 Titanium in 2001 to the Apple Watch Series 5, down to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a>. Apple's decision to use titanium for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models may have been influenced by the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj;, as the new Pro iPhones are also set to adopt the multi-purpose Action Button from the high-end Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
The use of titanium on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; also brings with it a change to the chassis finish. Previously, all Pro iPhones used heavily polished stainless steel with a mirror finish as the chassis material. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; will have a brushed finish that is considerably less reflective than the finish of previous Pro iPhones. The image below is perhaps the most accurate representation of the new brushed finish, closely resembling the finish found on prototype devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Pro-Colors-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907572" /><br/>
The new brushed finish is expected to reduce scratch visibility. Early in the development of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, Apple experimented with a mirror finish for the device for the titanium frame, in appearance very similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a>. The versions of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; with mirror finish, however, were found to be prone to scratches and dents – both of which were immediately noticeable on the mirror finish of the frame. Because of this, the mirror finish for the device was seemingly quickly abandoned in favor of the new brushed look.<br/>
<br/>
While titanium in combination with the brushed finish will allow for better fingerprint resistance and fewer visible scratches - durability issues may still be a potential concern. Although titanium has a higher hardness compared to stainless steel, it's also lighter, making it more prone to dents. To be more specific, the devices may be especially affected by corner dents, which can result in the color coating flaking off, revealing bare metal underneath. This phenomenon has been seen on prototype devices, although it is unclear if improvements have been made since.<br/>
<br/>
The introduction of titanium also influenced the selection of color options planned for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and 15 Pro Max. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/iphone-15-pro-blue/">Back in early July, we revealed</a> Apple was testing four different color options for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Blue</li><br/>
<li>Space Black / Space Gray</li><br/>
<li>Titanium Gray</li><br/>
<li>Silver</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
With the removal of the gold color option, we can expect a switch to more gray tones for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. Apple is expected to replace gold with a color option known internally as "Titanium Gray." Titanium Gray, as the name implies, is a color option similar to the color of natural titanium - darker than Silver, but lighter than the Space Black option.<br/>
<br/>
More recently, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">Apple issued invitations to its September 12 event</a> with the tagline "Wonderlust." The accompanying image and animation feature a multi-colored Apple logo made up of metallic particles, which many consider a subtle nod to the upcoming titanium frame on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. Furthermore, the colors used for the Apple logo match the color options for the 15 Pro, with varying shades of silver, gray, black and dark blue.<br/>
<br/>
The titanium chassis is also expected to lead to lighter devices. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/iphone-15-weights-and-dimensions/">According to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em></a>, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and 15 Pro Max are expected to be lighter than their respective predecessors by 18 grams, which is a reduction in weight by around 10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up, these are the key benefits and changes titanium is set to bring to the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Brushed finish</li><br/>
<li>Scratches will be less visible</li><br/>
<li>Improved fingerprint resistance</li><br/>
<li>Device weight reduced by 18 grams</li><br/>
<li>New color option – Titanium Gray</li></ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is hosting an online streaming event for the public and press on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">September 12, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time</a>. The company is expected to announce its new iPhone 15 lineup alongside an Apple Watch Series 9, an Apple Watch Ultra 2, and potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/iphone-15-apple-event-four-other-announcements/">other products during the event</a>, dubbed "Wonderlust." Here's how you can watch it and when, wherever you are in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTG2AE6hS9A" title="Last Minute Leaks: What to Expect at Apple&#39;s Fall iPhone Event!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
There are multiple ways to watch the September 12 event, with details listed below. We've also included a useful guide on when the event will take place in your particular time zone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Events Website</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events website</a>, you can watch the event live on a Mac, iPhone, ‌iPad‌, PC, or any other device with a web browser. The Apple Events website works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and other main browsers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/apple-events-webpage-sept-2023.jpg" alt="" width="1215" height="919" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908292" /><br/>
Just navigate to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">www.apple.com/apple-events/</a> using a web browser at the appropriate time to watch. You can visit the site now to add an event reminder to your calendar.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>YouTube</h2><br/>
Apple also plans to stream the event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiP1l7jlIIA">live on YouTube</a>, which is perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to watch because the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiP1l7jlIIA">YouTube live stream</a> can be viewed on every platform where YouTube is available, which is pretty much all platforms, from smartphones and tablets to consoles and smart TVs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiP1l7jlIIA?si=bH8ArKCsA-jtmR0J" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?">posted a placeholder for the September 12 event</a> on YouTube, and you can visit it now to set an event reminder.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV App</h2><br/>
Apple used to have a dedicated Apple Events app on the Apple TV, but ahead of WWDC 2020, it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/18/events-app-apple-tv-app-wwdc/">folded into the Apple TV app</a>. On event day, there will be a prominent ‌Apple TV‌ app section dedicated to the live stream, which can be watched on any device where the ‌Apple TV‌ app is available.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/appleevents1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1112" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-746566" /><br/>
This includes the ‌Apple TV‌, iPhones, iPads, and Macs, as well as select smart TVs, streaming devices, and gaming consoles. If you have an ‌Apple TV‌, the ‌Apple TV‌ app is one of the best ways to watch the event live. Apple hasn't updated the ‌Apple TV‌ app with the new event as of yet, but it should be added soon.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Verizon today is discounting the AirPods 3 with MagSafe Charging Case, available for <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-airpods-3rd-generation%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku4820001"><strong>&#36;159.00</strong></a>, from &#36;179.00. It's been a few months since we tracked a deal on the MagSafe version of the AirPods 3, and this is a solid second-best price.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-3-Discount-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895373" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Verizon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case is down to <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-airpods-3rd-generation-lightning-charging-case%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku5600049"><strong>&#36;149.99</strong></a> on Verizon, from &#36;169.00. This is another second-best price on the AirPods 3.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-airpods-3rd-generation-lightning-charging-case%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku5600049"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;19 OFF</div>AirPods 3 (Lightning) for &#36;149.99</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Shoppers should remember that you don't need to be a Verizon customer to take advantage of these deals. Verizon offers free two-day shipping and you can also opt for free express pick-up if there is a Verizon store near you with stock on the AirPods 3.<br/>
<br/>
Verizon also has the AirPods 2 for <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-airpods-charging-case%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku3390160"><strong>&#36;99.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00. This is one of the most consistent deals on AirPods that we've seen this year, and although we've seen it go lower, that's typically only been around major holidays or discount events.<br/>

		<title>Apple Extends Deal With Qualcomm as Custom 5G Modem Delayed</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has extended its agreement to obtain modems from Qualcomm for three more years, in what appears to be a sign that work on the company's own custom 5G modem is taking longer than previously expected, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-11/apple-aapl-renews-qualcomm-qcom-deal-in-sign-its-own-modem-chip-isn-t-ready"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/5G-Modem-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886940" /><br/>
Apple is Qualcomm's biggest client, accounting for almost a quarter of the supplier's revenue. In a statement, Qualcomm said that the deal with Apple covers "smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026." The agreement was originally set to expire this year and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup was once rumored to be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/09/apple-in-house-modem-chips-2024/">last to rely on Qualcomm</a> modems.<br/>
<br/>
The extension of the deal indicates that Apple's work on its own custom 5G modem is taking considerably longer than expected. Apple has reportedly been working on its own modem since 2018 and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/">acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> in 2019. The time frame for launching the modem has slipped from 2023 to 2024 or 2025, but <em>Bloomberg</em> now believes it has an even "longer runway" before it will be ready.<br/>
<br/>
While the new agreement extends to 2026, Apple could still begin rolling out its own modem in new devices before then. Earlier this month, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that the modem will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-modem-in-2025-kuo/">launch in 2025</a>. Apple's apparent plan to gradually transition to its custom modem technology is indicated by the fact that Qualcomm expects to still have a 20 percent share of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> shipments when the 2026 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; launches, suggesting that Apple will continue using Qualcomm modems in a minority of iPhones at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple purportedly wants its custom 5G modem to mirror its work on Apple silicon, touting considerable battery life and performance benefits. Thus far, the company's work on the component has apparently been mired by battery life issues and bureaucratic challenges, such as certifying the modem with connectivity authorities.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/apple-extends-deal-with-qualcomm-as-modem-delayed/">Apple Extends Deal With Qualcomm as Custom 5G Modem Delayed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-extends-deal-with-qualcomm-as-custom-5g-modem-delayed.2401021/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17: How to Separate Your Browsing Habits With Safari Profiles</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17, Safari has gained a new feature called Profiles, which is designed to help separate your browsing sessions into things like Work, School, or Personal. Here's how to use it in the <a href="http://How to Install the iOS 17 Public Beta">beta</a> and when iOS 17 is released to the general public later this month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-General-Safari-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904916" /><br/>
In ‌iOS 17‌, Apple expands on Tab Groups with a Profile feature that is designed to let you separate your browsing for different use cases. You can create a "Work" profile and a "Personal" profile, for example, so all of your work-related browsing is kept separate from your personal browsing.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-ios-17-public-beta/">How to Install the iOS 17 Public Beta</a></li></ul><br/>
Each profile gets its own icon and silos your history, Tab Groups, Favorites, Private Browsing tabs, and cookies. You can even assign specific extensions to different profiles to optimize your browsing experience based on the task at hand.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Create a Safari Profile</h2><br/>
To set up profiles on iPhones running iOS 17, simply follow these steps:<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on you iPhone or iPad.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down to <strong>Safari</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under the "Profiles" section, tap <strong>New Profile</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Select an icon, name, and background color for the profile.<br/>
<li>Choose your settings for <strong>Favorites</strong> and <strong>New Tabs</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Done</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/how-to-use-safari-profiles-ios1.jpg" alt="safari" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909889" /><br/>
<br/>
When you create a new profile, your device will automatically generate a "Personal" profile to differentiate other browsing sessions conducted outside of the profile you created. <br/>
<br/>
Both profiles and additional ones you create can be edited in the same section of the Settings app. When editing an existing profile, you can also opt to enable any Safari extensions you have installed on your device, as well as delete the profile if desired.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Switch Between Profiles in Safari</h2><br/>
<ol><li>In Safari, tap the <strong>Tabs icon</strong> with two overlapping squares.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>middle icon</strong> to bring up the active profile's menu.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>Profile</strong> option to change which profile is active.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/how-to-use-safari-profiles-ios3.jpg" alt="safari" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909888" /><br/>
<br/>
The Safari Profiles feature is available in iOS 17, iPadOS 17 and macOS Sonoma, as well as being part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-safari-17-macos-ventura-monterey/">Safari 17 for macOS Monterey and macOS Ventura</a>.

		<title>iPhone Mini Might Be Discontinued Following Apple Event This Week After Three-Year Run</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Fans of smaller phones rejoiced when Apple introduced the iPhone 12 mini in 2020, followed by the iPhone 13 mini a year later. However, after nearly three years of availability, the end of the road might be near for the 5.4-inch device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iPhone-mini-wonder-feature-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1444" height="812" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-794050" /><br/>
As noted <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1700953564577923085">by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, iPhone 13 mini stock is running low, with Apple's online store in the U.S. quoting a 2-3 week shipping estimate for some models, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-13/5.4-inch-display-256gb-green-unlocked">even 6-8 weeks</a> for a few others. The shortage suggests that the iPhone 13 mini might be discontinued after Apple announces new iPhones at its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/what-to-expect-apple-fall-event-2023/">"Wonderlust" event on Tuesday</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not release an iPhone 14 mini last year, but it kept the iPhone 13 mini available as a lower-cost option, with pricing starting at &#36;599 in the U.S. If you are interested in buying the iPhone 13 mini, now might be your last chance, as it is looking likely that Apple will discontinue the device on Tuesday after unveiling the iPhone 15 series. Apple's new lineup will likely consist of the 6.1-inch iPhone 15, 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus, 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro, 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max, 4.7-inch iPhone SE, and the 6.1-inch iPhone 13.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just want to say that I hate you all for not buying the iPhone mini resulting in its cancellation and I’ll never forgive you for it.</p>&mdash; Snazzy Labs (@SnazzyLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyLabs/status/1699471555695370384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
While there initially appeared to be pent-up demand for a smaller iPhone, actual data suggested that the iPhone mini had low sales relative to other iPhone models. In April 2022, research firm CIRP estimated that the ‌iPhone 13‌ mini accounted for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/21/iphone-13-mini-unpopular-march-quarter/">just 3% of ‌overall iPhone 13‌ sales</a> in the U.S. in the first quarter of that year.<br/>
<br/>
Going forward, customers who want a small iPhone from Apple will have to settle for the entry-level iPhone SE, but even that device is rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/kuo-iphone-se-4-oled-display/">updated with a larger 6.1-inch display</a> in the next year or two. At least for the time being, it appears that Apple has realized that smaller phones just aren't that popular after all.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/iphone-mini-might-be-discontinued-this-week/">iPhone Mini Might Be Discontinued Following Apple Event This Week After Three-Year Run</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-mini-might-be-discontinued-following-apple-event-this-week-after-three-year-run.2400995/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple may be planning to discontinue its silicone rubber and fluoroelastomer accessories, replacing them with ones made of more eco-friendly next-generation materials, <em>MacRumors</em> has been told.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-14-and-14-Plus-New-Silcone-Case-Colors-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2056" height="1156" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887977" /><br/>
The move is expected to include accessories such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Silicone Case with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, Sport Band, Solo Loop, and AirTag Loop. The rumor comes from Apple device collector and leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>," who has previously shared information about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">braided USB-C cable</a>, various prototypes such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/apple-planned-magsafe-charger-color-options/">MagSafe chargers</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/apple-prototyped-airpods-in-five-color-options/">AirPods</a> in different color options, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is widely expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/17/apple-may-not-offer-leather-cases-for-iphone-15/">discontinue</a> its leather &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cases following the introduction of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup, replacing them accessories made with a premium material marketed as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/finewoven-cases-may-match-new-watch-band/">FineWoven</a>." The discontinuation of silicone accessories is not expected to be imminent, instead taking place via a more gradual transition whereby existing models are not refreshed with new color options. For example, Sport Band may not be refreshed with new color options following the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, being available until supplies of the current units run out. Apple is expected to release new accessory designs, such as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/new-apple-watch-magnetic-band/">"FineWoven" Apple Watch band</a> with a magnetic buckle, to replace its outgoing products.<br/>
<br/>
The discontinuation of all leather and silicone Apple accessories is believed to be part of a wider move to transition to more environmentally friendly materials. While Apple's silicone rubber accessories have a lower carbon footprint than their leather counterparts, they are not made with any recycled materials. Materials like fluoroelastomer are also difficult to recycle due to their heat-resistant properties and strong, crosslinked structure.<br/>

"FineWoven" is expected to be the first next-generation material used by Apple, replacing leather in the immediate term, but it could also displace some silicone accessories at some point. There will likely also be other new, more eco-friendly materials introduced on other accessories in the future.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-cases/">iPhone Cases</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-bands/">Apple Watch Bands</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/silicone-case/">Silicone Case</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/apple-planning-to-discontinue-silicone-accessories/">Apple May Be Planning to Discontinue All of Its Silicone Accessories</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-may-be-planning-to-discontinue-all-of-its-silicone-accessories.2400974/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Images of fake <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> Battery Packs with a USB-C charging port instead of Lightning are being shared on social media sites, potentially hinting at preparations to mirror Apple's release of such an accessory.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/magsafe-battery-pack-with-usb-c-port.jpg" alt="" width="3200" height="1800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909783" /><br/>
The current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe Battery Pack</a> is a widely counterfeited accessory, but most one-to-one replicas available to date feature a Lightning port. The latest series of images, shared across X (formerly Twitter) and Weibo, depict the same one-to-one replicas but with a USB-C charging port.<br/>
<br/>
The entire <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup is expected to move away from Lightning and feature a USB-C charging port for the first time, and Apple is expected to bring USB-C to other devices and accessories <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/usb-c-airpods-and-airpods-max-2024/">over the next year</a>. It is not clear if Apple plans to release a new version of the &zwnj;MagSafe Battery Pack&zwnj; with a USB-C port, but it is expected to do so with other accessories such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>'s &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charging Case alongside the release of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All new Apple accessories will have to follow USB C standards, this means that even older models will be updated. Here is a Usb C model of the MagSafe Battery <a href="https://t.co/QrMVJOld5u">pic.twitter.com/QrMVJOld5u</a></p>&mdash; Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1700859263034298647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br/>
<br/>
On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/the-macrumors-show-mark-gurman-iphone-15-event-expectations/">most recent episode</a> of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> podcast, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/multiple-usb-c-apple-accessories-planned/">seeking to move to USB-C</a> across its lineup of accessories by next year, likely including the &zwnj;MagSafe Battery Pack&zwnj;. The transition will apparently be relatively fast, mirroring the transition to the Lightning connector following its introduction in 2012.<br/>
<br/>
"They're going to need to do a new &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Duo with USB-C," Gurman said, and Apple "certainly can update the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; battery pack" to add USB-C. It is not entirely clear if these refreshed accessories will be introduced at its "Wonderlust" event on Tuesday, September 12, but the proliferation of images of fakes could hint that Apple is preparing to launch some of them next week.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">mangetic wireless power bank charges <a href="https://t.co/BvWaxKOEzn">pic.twitter.com/BvWaxKOEzn</a></p>&mdash; fix Apple &#x1f34f; (@lipilipsi) <a href="https://twitter.com/lipilipsi/status/1700491406589284687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br/>
<br/>
In addition, Gurman explained that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/multiple-usb-c-apple-accessories-planned/">all-new MagSafe Battery Pack</a> is in development, but it is not yet ready to be introduced. The next-generation battery pack apparently involves a new concept that allows users to "daisy-chain" multiple battery packs together by stacking them and wirelessly charge multiple devices at the same time. For example, it will be possible to charge two iPhones at the same time, with one placed on either side of the battery pack.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/">USB-C</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe Battery Pack</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/counterfeiters-preparing-for-usb-c-magsafe-battery/">Counterfeiters Preparing for Launch of USB-C MagSafe Battery Pack</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/counterfeiters-preparing-for-launch-of-usb-c-magsafe-battery-pack.2400972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The sixth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> should launch in October as the only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> refresh of 2023, according to a plausible rumor shared on Chinese social media site Weibo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/ipad-air-5-colors.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-839734" /><br/>
"Only the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; series should be updated this year," the post reads, with a subsequent clarification that the product refresh will take place in October, with "no mini and Pro this year." The information comes from an account with a proven track record for disclosing accurate information about Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>
On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/the-macrumors-show-mark-gurman-iphone-15-event-expectations/">latest episode</a> of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> podcast, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that there is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/">new iPad Air</a> with improved specifications in the works and the device is apparently "coming soonish," likely in October. The rumor was posted to Weibo prior to Gurman's most recent remarks.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman believes that there will be a further Apple product launch in October, but expressed skepticism that an entire event will take place to introduce new devices. He said that it could be similar to the introduction of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max MacBook Pro models earlier this year, which were announced via press release and a short video. Gurman claimed that October could see something "along those lines." "I'm not sure they have enough to drag people down to Cupertino to watch the video like they do for this [<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>] launch," he added.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last updated the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-unveils-new-ipad-air/">in March 2022</a> with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, an upgraded 12-megapixel front camera with Center Stage support, a faster USB-C port, 5G support on cellular models, and new color options. Pricing starts at &#36;599 in the U.S. for 64GB of storage. It is unclear what <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/19/ipad-air-6-key-upgrades-to-expect/">new features</a> the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will offer, but possibilities include the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, a Thunderbolt port like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> hover, and new color options.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october/">iPad Air 6 Rumored to Launch in October as Only iPad Refresh of 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october-as-only-ipad-refresh-of-2023.2400947/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iPhone 15 Pro is expected to feature a new midframe made from <a href="https://twitter.com/URedditor/status/1683130501626773504">Grade 5 titanium</a>, resulting in a substantially lighter device overall. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">Mark Gurman recently said</a> that the iPhone 15 Pro could be up to 10 percent lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Pro-Blue-Front-Perspective-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905593" /><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> has obtained the exact dimensions of the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the information appears to corroborate Gurman's claims.<br/>
<br/>
<b>iPhone 15 dimensions and weight</b>:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><b>Thickness</b>: 7.8mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Length</b>: 147.6mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Width</b>: 71.6mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Weight</b>: 171 grams</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<b>iPhone 14 dimensions and weight:</b><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><b>Thickness</b>: 7.8mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Length: </b>146.7mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Width: </b>71.5mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Weight:</b> 172 grams</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The base model iPhone 15 could be considered the least different of the lineup, with its dimensions and total weight being similar to that of the iPhone 14. The iPhone 15 will maintain the exact same thickness as last year's model, with negligible changes to the length and width of the device. According to our sources, the iPhone 15 is said to continue to use the exact same chassis material as the iPhone 14 -- 6013 T6 aluminum. With no significant differences in materials and no noteworthy structural changes, it's easy to see why the weight of the standard iPhone 15 is close to that of the iPhone 14.<br/>
<br/>
While the exact dimensions of the iPhone 15 Plus are not apparent at the time of writing, it is safe to assume the size difference between the iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 14 Plus is minimal at best. As no major design changes, structural changes, or changes in materials are expected, the iPhone 15 Plus will also likely have a weight similar to that of its predecessor.<br/>
<br/>
<b>iPhone 15 Pro dimensions and weight:</b><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><b>Thickness</b>: 8.25mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Length</b>: 146.6mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Width</b>: 70.6mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Weight</b>: 188 grams</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<b>iPhone 14 Pro dimensions and weight:</b><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><b>Thickness</b>: 7.85mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Length: </b>147.5mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Width: </b>71.5mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Weight:</b> 206 grams</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro is set to bring improvements in at least one key area -- weight. Compared to its predecessor, the iPhone 15 Pro will be 18 grams lighter due to the change in materials. Our sources were able to verify that Apple is using Grade 5 Titanium for the iPhone 15 Pro, which represents a notable departure from the stainless steel used on every Pro iPhone thus far. Grade 5 Titanium, also known as Ti-6Al-4V, is a titanium alloy used in a variety of industries and is widely known for its excellent corrosion resistance.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the dimensions are concerned, the iPhone 15 Pro is expected to maintain a form factor similar to its predecessor, with slight differences in the length and width of the device. One noteworthy difference, though, is the thickness of the device. The iPhone 15 Pro features an increased thickness -- 8.25mm compared to 7.85 on the iPhone 14 Pro. The thickness change could be regarded as an interesting choice, considering the company has previously used reduced thickness as a selling point for certain devices. The reduced bezel size of the iPhone 15 Pro display will likely overshadow the increase in thickness, however.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro is expected to have thinner bezels due to the use of advanced display technology known as LIPO, an acronym for "low-injection pressure over-molding". <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-30/apple-iphone-15-pro-features-usb-c-port-new-design-thinner-bezels-lkpemg29">First mentioned by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, and since independently confirmed by <em>MacRumors</em>, the use of LIPO technology for iPhone 15 Pro displays is expected to reduce the bezel size from the current 2.2mm to approximately 1.55mm.<br/>
<br/>
<b>iPhone 15 Pro Max dimensions and weight:</b><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><b>Thickness</b>: 8.25mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Length: </b>159.9mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Width: </b>76.7mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Weight:</b> 221 grams</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<b>iPhone 14 Pro Max dimensions and weight</b>:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><b>Thickness</b>: 7.85mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Length: </b>160.7mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Width: </b>77.6mm</li><br/>
 	<li><b>Weight:</b> 240 grams</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to feature the same changes as the smaller iPhone 15 Pro, weighing 19 grams less than the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Because of this, it's safe to assume that the difference in weight is a result of the change in materials, rather than any sort of significant structural changes or design differences compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that the information presented here is <b>pre-production information</b>, and may not reflect the hardware of mass production units, but it represents our best insight into the dimensions of the iPhone 15 range. According to our sources, the dimensions of the iPhone 15 lineup have remained unchanged throughout development, although slight differences in weight may be possible due to the different hardware configurations Apple tested.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The calendar has turned to September, and new iPhone season is upon us! Apple will be announcing the iPhone 15 series at an event scheduled for Tuesday, September 12, at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, with a live stream to be available on YouTube and on Apple's website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/top-stories-9sep2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909646" /><br/>
Read on below for all the details on what we're expecting (and not expecting) next week, and tune in on Tuesday as <em>MacRumors</em> will be on hand to see what Apple has in store.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What to Expect From Apple's September 12 Event: iPhone 15, Apple Watch Ultra 2, USB-C AirPods and More</h2><br/>
Ahead of Tuesday's event we've recapped everything we expect to see on Tuesday, which includes the iPhone 15 lineup, new Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/What-to-Expect-at-Apples-Wonderlust-Event-Feature-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909518" /><br/>
The iPhone 15 lineup will be the headliner of the show, with all four models expected to be equipped with a USB-C port and the Dynamic Island, while many additional features have been rumored for the Pro models, including a titanium frame, customizable Action button, A17 Bionic chip, Wi-Fi 6E support, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 15 Camera Specifications</h2><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/iphone-15-series-camera-specs/">shared detailed camera specifications for the entire iPhone 15 lineup</a>, ahead of the devices being unveiled next week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Blue-Three-Quarters-Perspective-Camera-Closeup-Feature-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909014" /><br/>
Key camera-related features expected include a stacked camera sensor for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and a periscope telephoto lens for the iPhone 15 Pro Max that enables up to 6x optical zoom. These camera features will supposedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/iphone-15-camera-upgrades-trendforce/">be the "star of the show" at Apple's event</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 to Feature New Heart Rate Monitor, More Accurate Sensors, U2 Chip, and More</h2><br/>
While we're not expecting significant design changes for the upcoming Apple Watch models, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman says there will be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-sensors-and-more/">fair number of under-the-hood changes</a> led by a new S9 chip that will deliver the first real upgrade in that regard since the Apple Watch Series 6.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-Series-9-Pink-Aluminum-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905452" /><br/>
In addition, there should be some upgrades to the various sensors and other components with a "focus on speed, efficiency, and accuracy." A new "U2" Ultra Wideband chip will enhance location tracking capabilities with an eye toward improvements to the Find My ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Stores to Update Overnight After 'Wonderlust' Event in Preparation for iPhone 15 Launch</h2><br/>
Apple retail stores <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/apple-retail-stores-overnight-event-update/">will be making updates on the night after the Apple event</a> next week, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-store-washington.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-891495" /><br/>
It's likely that the stores will be rolling out marketing materials for new products announced at the Apple event, including the iPhone 15 series. Other products expected to be unveiled include the Apple Watch Series 9, a new Apple Watch Ultra, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/usb-c-airpods-at-iphone-15-event-report/">a USB-C AirPods case</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Models Again Rumored to See &#36;100 Price Increase</h2><br/>
The upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models may some price increases compared to the current models, although rumors are unclear on how exactly things will play out.<br/>
<br/>

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/major-price-hike-rumored-for-iphone-15-pro-models/">others</a> believe <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/iphone-15-pro-models-rumored-to-see-price-increase/">each will cost &#36;100 more</a> than the current Pro models in the U.S., meaning the iPhone 15 Pro would start at &#36;1,099 and the iPhone 15 Pro Max would start at &#36;1,199.<br/>
<br/>
Research firm TrendForce believes, however, that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/iphone-15-pro-will-still-start-at-999-trendforce/">price increase will be limited to the Pro Max model</a>, with the smaller iPhone 15 Pro still starting at &#36;999.<br/>

<h2>What Not to Expect at Apple's 'Wonderlust' Event</h2><br/>
To help set expectations ahead of Apple's "Wonderlust" event, we've compiled a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/what-not-to-expect-apple-september-iphone-15-event/">list of products that Apple is unlikely to announce</a> during the keynote.<br/>
<br/>

For example, the first Macs with the M3 chip are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/">not expected to be announced until October</a>. Other rumored products, such as a second-generation HomePod mini and iPad Pro models with OLED displays, are not expected to be released until 2024.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to refresh many of its accessories to add a USB-C port following the transition away from Lightning on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> told <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/magsafe-battery-pack-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2490" height="1401" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-807787" /><br/>
On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/the-macrumors-show-mark-gurman-iphone-15-event-expectations/">most recent episode</a> of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> podcast, Gurman said that Apple is seeking to move to USB-C across its lineup of accessories by next year, including all of its AirPods models and Mac accessories. The transition will apparently be relatively fast, mirroring the transition to the Lightning connector following its introduction in 2012.<br/>
<br/>
"They're going to need to do a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> Duo with USB-C," Gurman said, and Apple "certainly can update the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; battery pack" to add USB-C. It is not entirely clear if these refreshed accessories will be introduced at Apple's "Wonderlust" event on Tuesday, September 12.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman also mused that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/apple-discontinues-apple-watch-dock/">now-discontinued</a> Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Dock could be reintroduced with a USB-C port. Although Apple needs to refresh a large selection of its cables and accessories relatively quickly, he is "not expecting any curveballs or any brand new types of accessories" to be announced at the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Apple event.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Gurman explained that a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe Battery Pack</a> is in development, but it is likely not yet ready to be introduced. The next-generation battery pack involves a new concept that allows users to "daisy-chain" multiple battery packs together by stacking them and wirelessly charge multiple devices at the same time. For example, it will be possible to charge two iPhones at the same time, with one placed on either side of the battery pack. It will also, of course, feature a USB-C port.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said that he does not think the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> with a USB-C port on the charging case, due to be announced next week, will be marketed as "third-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;." The third-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; will be a more significant update launching next year or early 2025, Gurman claimed.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple may not have enough new products and features to launch to justify holding an event in October, leading it to unveil devices like the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> via press release, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/Air-2022-M1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2244" height="1272" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-839997" /><br/>
On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/the-macrumors-show-mark-gurman-iphone-15-event-expectations/">latest episode</a> of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> podcast, Gurman said that Apple will not introduce any new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models at its "Wonderlust" event next week, which is expected to focus on next-generation Apple Watches and iPhones only.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said that there is a new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with improved specifications in the works and the device is apparently "coming soonish." He added that "we may get an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; refresh in October," not including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, which is not expected to be updated until next year.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman believes that there will be a further Apple product launch in October, but expressed skepticism that an entire event will take place to introduce new devices. He said that it could be similar to the introduction of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max MacBook Pro models earlier this year, which were announced via press release and a short video. Gurman claimed that October could see something "along those lines." "I'm not sure they have enough to drag people down to Cupertino to watch the video like they do for this [<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>] launch," he added.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">reported</a> that Apple will not launch new MacBook models with M3 chips before the end of this year. Previously, the introduction of the first MacBooks with the M3 chip were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/">expected to take place</a> at an Apple event in October.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone-centric 2023 fall event is set to begin in just a few days. We've been hearing rumors about what we can expect to see for months now, so we have a good idea of what's coming.<br/>
<br/>

This guide highlights everything that we're expecting to see Apple debut at its "Wonderlust" event on September 12.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="iphone_15_and_iphone_15_plus"><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus</a></h2><br/>
Apple will continue with its four-iPhone lineup in 2023, and the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models will be available in 6.1 and 6.7-inch sizes, similar to last year. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus will look almost identical to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus, with one major exception - a USB-C port.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Colors-Mock-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907571" /><br/>
Rather than a Lightning port, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models will adopt USB-C, which will allow iPhones, iPads, and Macs to share a charger and a charging cable. Apple is making this change due to regulatory changes in Europe that require electronics to have a standardized charging port, but USB-C technology will be implemented worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iPhone-15-to-Switch-From-Lightning-to-USB-C-in-2023-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2621" height="1475" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845312" /><br/>
Last year's iPhones continued to have a notch, but that's being eliminated with the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. Instead, the new iPhones will adopt the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> that Apple first used for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; Max, freeing up more display space.<br/>
<br/>
Though the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus will get the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, other display technology like the ProMotion refresh rate and always-on display will remain limited to the Pro models. There's one other small design change, which has to do with the glass back. Frosted glass has historically been a feature for the Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup, but the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus are expected to have a frosted glass back instead of a glossy glass back.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is planning new colors for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup, and rumors so far suggest that we will see blue, a coral shade that's a cross between orange and pink, a light greenish yellow color, white, and black. We could see color-matched braided USB-C cables to go along with each new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/usbc-colored-iphone-15-cables.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907593" /><br/>
Camera technology will see a significant update with the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus adopting a 48-megapixel Main camera with an f/1.6 aperture for higher-resolution images and improved quality in low lighting situations. There will also be a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, but this is the same camera in the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; models with no updates.<br/>
<br/>
New Qualcomm 5G modem chips are expected and we could see improved signal, lower latency, and better power efficiency. Apple is developing a new A17 chip for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, but the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models will get the A16 chip that's currently in the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
We have so far heard no rumors of improvements to battery life, WiFi speeds, or RAM for the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, and pricing is expected to remain the same.<br/>
<br/>
More on what to expect from the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">found in our iPhone 15 roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="iphone_15_pro_and_iphone_15_pro_max"><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max</a></h2><br/>
Most of the exciting new changes and feature additions this year are coming to the Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models rather than the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models. As with last year, we are expecting two Pro iPhones, the 6.1-inch &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and the 6.7-inch &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Pro-Colors-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907572" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to have some minor design updates, with Apple introducing notably thinner, curved bezels and a new titanium material for the chassis. Rather than stainless steel, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max will feature titanium in colors that include silver, titanium gray, black, and dark blue. Titanium will have a more matte finish than stainless steel, plus the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models could be 10 percent lighter because titanium weighs less than steel.<br/>
<br/>
While there were rumors of volume button changes that Apple was experimenting with, the volume button update did not pan out and there will be no change there. Apple is, however, expected to swap the mute switch for a mute button that will have multiple functions much like the Action button on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Code in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> suggests the button will be able to toggle on Silent Mode, activate the Camera, turn on the Flashlight, activate a Shortcut, turn on a Focus mode, launch the Translate app, start a Voice Memo, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Like the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models will get USB-C, but the Pro models are rumored to support faster USB 3.2 (20Gb/s) or Thunderbolt (40Gb/s) transfer speeds. Some of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models (likely the Pro models) are rumored to support charging speeds up to 35W.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is making minor improvements to the Wide Angle and Telephoto cameras of both Pro models to boost low-light performance, but the Main 48-megapixel camera isn't expected to see any improvements. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max will get the biggest new camera feature, a periscope zoom function for the telephoto lens. Optical zoom right now is limited to 3x, but with periscope technology, Apple is expected to bring that to 5x or 6x zoom.<br/>
<br/>
While the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models will use the A16 chip, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max will be equipped with the A17 chip, built on a new 3-nanometer process. This will be the first chip in several years built on a new node, and it should bring notable performance and efficiency improvements. An increase in battery life is expected. <br/>
<br/>
Apple will use the same 5G Qualcomm chip across its entire &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup, and there are also rumors of a new "U2" Ultra Wideband chip that will integrate with the Vision Pro headset coming out next year. The Pro models will get Wi-Fi 6E, the newest and fastest Wi-Fi protocol that works with the 6GHz band. Up to 2TB of storage might be available, and the Pro models will have 8GB RAM, up from 6GB in last year's Pro models. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max have a rich feature set, and rumors suggest it's going to bring a price increase. Multiple sources have said Apple is planning a price hike, but it's not yet clear how much. The new models could be &#36;100 more expensive, which would see the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; starting at &#36;1,099 and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max starting at &#36;1,199.<br/>
<br/>
More information on what to expect from the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">can be found in our roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_watch_series_9"><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></h2><br/>
There's a new Apple Watch coming this year, but there's not much to look forward to with this iterative update. We are not expecting any new design changes or new health-related features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-Series-9-Pink-Aluminum-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905452" /><br/>
In fact, the refresh will focus on the internals, mainly a new processor. There's going to be a new S9 chip that's built on the A15 technology, and it will be the first notable update to the Apple Watch chip since the Apple Watch Series 6.<br/>
<br/>
Performance will be improved on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, and we could also see an increase in battery life. The &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-sensors-and-more/">expected to include</a> an updated optical heart rate sensor and a new "U2" Ultra Wideband chip that will offer better location precision.<br/>
<br/>
There might be a new pinkish color for the aluminum version of the Series 9, and Apple might be planning to introduce a new type of band with woven fabric and a magnetic buckle. There have also been rumors that leather bands are being phased out in favor of more eco-friendly options.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="apple_watch_ultra_2"><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/#whats_next_for_the_apple_watch_ultra">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj; is expected to get a refresh in 2023, but we are not expecting new functionality. The device will get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-sensors-and-more/">the same S9 chip</a> that's coming to the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;, the updated Ultra Wideband chip, and the new heart rate sensor, but if any other features are planned, we don't know about them.<br/>
<br/>

One leaker has suggested the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj; might be lighter than the first-generation, but it is not yet clear if this is accurate. One change might be a new color option, with rumors pointing toward a black titanium shade.<br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="usb-c_airpods">USB-C AirPods</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 are expected to be updated with a USB-C charging case to replace the current Lightning case, a change that will coincide with the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;'s adoption of a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airpods-pro-2-red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906243" /><br/>
No other hardware changes will be included, so count on the same &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 as before but with an updated charging port.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_iphone_cases">New iPhone Cases</h2><br/>
According to multiple sources, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/17/apple-may-not-offer-leather-cases-for-iphone-15/">doesn't plan to manufacture</a> leather cases for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup, and will instead adopt a more environmentally friendly material.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-finewoven-case-colors.jpg" alt="" width="4800" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908631" /><br/>
There is a rumor that the new material will be made of a woven material and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/iphone-15-finewoven-case-rumors/">will be called</a> "FineWoven," but it is as of yet unclear if that is accurate.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_possibilities">Other Possibilities</h2><br/>
With some of the fall events, there are wildcard products that may or may not be refreshed in September, but this year, there's not much we're expecting beyond the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="11th-generation_ipad">11th-Generation iPad</h3><br/>
There have been no rumors about a new low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, but Apple has historically refreshed the tablet on an annual basis. It's possible we're going to see an 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, but not guaranteed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/purple-ipad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903331" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="possibly_coming_later_this_year">Possibly Coming Later This Year</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models and &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; may not be the last products we see in 2023. The first M3 Macs could be introduced before the end of the year, with Apple rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/">planning to introduce</a> an M3 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, M3 13-inch MacBook Pro, and M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> says M3 Macs are coming this year, but Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> says no M3 Macs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">will be unveiled</a> until 2024, so it's unclear what might happen.<br/>
<br/>
If new Macs are coming in 2023, Apple could hold an October event or could release the M3 Macs via press release later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; also believes there is a possibility that a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> will be released in 2023. If so, we could perhaps see it in October.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="not_coming_yet">Not Coming Yet</h2><br/>
With the exception of the 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, no other iPads are getting a refresh in 2023. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> are going to get updated, but not until 2024.<br/>
<br/>

Mark is known for his accurate insider knowledge about Apple's plans and he is behind many of the major reports covered here on <em>MacRumors</em>. Earlier today, he published a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">detailed report</a> outlining his expectations for Apple's "Wonderlust" event, revealing a range of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/last-minute-iphone-15-report-reveals-new-details/">new details</a> about the devices Apple is expected to unveil.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max will apparently feature battery life improvements, increased megapixels for their telephoto and ultra wide cameras, and an all-new U2 chip, while Mark shares some background on the shift to a titanium chassis.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a> will have a significantly faster processor, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-sensors-and-more/">more accurate sensors</a> such as a next-generation optical heart rate monitor, new color options, and manufacturing changes like additional recycled materials and 3D printing.<br/>
<br/>
Mark also shares a few tidbits related to Apple's other product plans including an updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> in the works, new USB-C accessories, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, Apple's "Wonderlust" event is expected to see the unveiling the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;, second-generation &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, new premium cases that are no longer made of leather, refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> with a USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charging case, and potentially some other new USB-C accessories. The event is set to take place on Tuesday, September 12 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://howl.me/ckxNEejpIxm">Samsung</a> today kicked off its latest "Discover Samsung" sale, this one described as the first major discount event of the fall season. The sale officially begins Monday, September 11, but Samsung is providing early access to a select few products right now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/samsung-new-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-889540" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
We've highlighted some of the best discounts in the list below, including deals on TVs, computer monitors, earbuds, and soundbars. These are early access deals, but should run the duration of the event, which lasts through September 17. <br/>
<br/>
A highlight of the sale is a discount on the new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5 Smartphone, which Samsung has for &#36;120 off select colors on the 512GB model. You can get it for <a href="https://howl.me/ckxNRNevDx0"><strong>&#36;1,799.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,919.99 in Phantom Black and Icy Blue.<br/>

<br/>
There are more savings in the smartphone category as well, with bigger discounts appearing when you bundle a Samsung smartphone with tablets, smartwatches, and earbuds. You can save &#36;230 on a Galaxy Tab S9, up to &#36;250 on a Galaxy Watch6, and &#36;180 on Galaxy Buds2 Pro when purchased at the same time as any of Samsung's smartphone devices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's highest-end iPhone this year will be named iPhone 15 Pro Max, instead of iPhone 15 Ultra, according to a report on Friday from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The other devices in the lineup will include the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, and iPhone 15 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iPhone-Ultra-in-Hand-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886425" /><br/>
Gurman himself previously reported that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/25/iphone-15-ultra-replacing-pro-max-model/">considered Ultra branding</a> for its highest-end iPhone, similar to the Apple Watch Ultra, and it is possible it will be used for the iPhone 16 Ultra with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">larger 6.9-inch display</a> next year. For now, however, it appears that Pro Max branding will live on for at least another year.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro Max is rumored to exclusively feature an upgraded telephoto lens with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/iphone-15-pro-max-5-6x-optical-zoom/">up to 6x optical zoom</a>, compared to a 3x limit on the iPhone 14 Pro models. The device is also expected to feature a titanium frame, customizable Action button, faster A17 Bionic chip, thinner bezels, Wi-Fi 6E support, and more. iPhone 15 Pro Max pricing is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/iphone-15-pro-will-still-start-at-999-trendforce/">rumored to start at &#36;1,199</a> in the U.S., which would be &#36;100 more than the iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 15 series at its "Wonderlust" event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">on Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> update has a handful of new features for the Notes and Reminders app, making them more useful for those who prefer the default Apple apps. There are no major overhauls, but the additions do add to the utility of the apps and are changes that some have wanted for some time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17-General-Notes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909611" /><br/>
This guide highlights everything that's new in both the Notes and Reminders apps.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><br/>
<h3 id="linking_notes">Linking Notes</h3><br/>
It's now possible to link one note to another note, useful for connecting two related notes to one another for Wiki-style documentation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/linking-notes-ios-17.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898679" /><br/>
<h3 id="inline_pdfs_and_scanned_documents">Inline PDFs and Scanned Documents</h3><br/>
The Notes app supports inline PDFs, which means you can insert a PDF into Notes and then read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ipados-17-pdfs-in-notes.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900348" /><br/>
This functionality also works for scanned documents, and it is available on both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="updated_formatting">Updated Formatting</h3><br/>
Notes has gained an option for creating block quotes, plus there's a new Monostyled format to choose.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="pages">Pages</h3><br/>
A Note from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can be opened up in the Pages app, providing additional layout and formatting options.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="reminders">Reminders</h2><br/>
<h3 id="grocery_sorting">Grocery Sorting</h3><br/>
When you create a list with the new "Groceries" list type, you can input various foods and sundries and have them organized automatically by category. The organization makes it easier to find what you need when you're at the grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-reminders-app.jpg" alt="" width="5459" height="3071" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899272" /><br/>
Available category types include Produce, Breads &amp; Cereals, Frozen Foods, Snacks &amp; Candy, Meat, Dairy, Eggs &amp; Cheese, Bakery, Baking Items, Household Items, Personal Care &amp; Health, and Wine, Beer &amp; Spirits.<br/>
<br/>
If the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ doesn't recognize where an item should go, it remains uncategorized. It does recognize specific brands and types of food like "Sour Patch Kids," so it is a fairly robust solution for grocery shopping. You can also create your own categories in the grocery list.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="custom_sections">Custom Sections</h3><br/>
Sections or categories are turned on by default for the Grocery list, but any Reminder list created in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; can have sections added to it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/reminders-sections.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909626" /><br/>
In any list, tap on the three dots to get to the options interface. From there, tap on New Section to add a section to the list. You'll need to manually organize items in the list in each section, but it can be done with simple drag and drop gestures.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="column_view">Column View</h3><br/>
In the same options interface, there's a new "View as Columns" option that will show each section in a side-by-side view. You can swap between column and list view in the options menu.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/reminders-ios-17-column-view.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909625" /><br/>
<h3 id="interactive_widgets">Interactive Widgets</h3><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; brings interactive widgets to the Lock Screen and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, and Reminders is one of the built-in apps that can best take advantage of this feature. Reminders in the Reminders widget can be checked off right from the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; or the Lock Screen without having to open up the Reminders app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/reminders-widget.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909624" /><br/>
<h3 id="early_reminders">Early Reminders</h3><br/>
If you add a reminder with a specific date, you can opt to receive an early reminder to get a warning ahead of time. You can get a notification 1 day before, 2 days before, 1 week before, 2 weeks before, 1 month before, 3 months before, and 6 months before, plus there's also an option to set a custom early reminder time.<br/>
