		<description><![CDATA[Oregon this week signed a Right to Repair bill into law, and it is notable because it is the first such law that puts a stop to the practice of parts pairing. Manufacturers like Apple are not able to require customers to use Apple-sourced parts that then have to be authenticated, with the bill giving Apple device owners the right to use new parts, used parts, or third-party parts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Self-Service-Repair-Program-iPhone.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895789" /><br/>
Apple has launched repair tools for both independent repair shops and consumers, but repair components must be purchased directly from Apple. Components must be paired with a device serial number after being installed, which prevents unauthorized repairs that use third-party components. The bill states that companies cannot reduce the performance of a device or display misleading warnings for parts that are not properly paired.<br/>
<br/>
According to repair site <em><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/92144/oregon-just-struck-a-blow-to-parts-pairing-and-won-a-decade-of-repair-support">iFixit</a></em>, Oregon's Right to Repair law is the strongest that has been passed to date. It does have consumer protections, such as requiring independent repair shops to have a "valid and unexpired certification" ensuring the person doing the repair has the "technical capabilities and competence necessary" to make a successful fix.<br/>
<br/>
The elimination of the parts pairing restriction will allow independent repair shops to make more repairs without having to rely solely on components from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to preventing manufacturers from requiring components to be free from pairing restrictions, the law requires companies to make parts, tools, documentation, and software available for smartphones produced in 2021 or later. For other electronics like computers, it is applicable to devices produced in 2015 and later. <br/>
<br/>
Apple did not support Oregon's Right to Repair bill, and the company has said that it will result in safety and security issues for consumers. Apple will need to comply with the parts pairing portion of the bill for products made after January 1, 2025.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/oregon-right-to-repair-law/">Oregon&#039;s New Right to Repair Law Bans &#039;Parts Pairing&#039; Restrictions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oregons-new-right-to-repair-law-bans-parts-pairing-restrictions.2423051/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-app">launched the Amazon One app</a>, which is designed to allow customers to scan their palms to make device-free purchases at Whole Foods, Panera Bread, and 150 third-party locations in stadiums, airports, fitness centers, and convenience stores.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Amazon One launches an app to make sign-up for its palm-recognition service even easier" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VNcZaPlKyTA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Prior to the launch of the app, signing up for Amazon One had to be done in a physical location with an Amazon One device. The app lets customers create a profile, take a photo of their palm, and add a payment method. Finishing sign-up will still require an initial interaction with an Amazon One machine.<br/>
<br/>
Amazon One can be used for payment, entry to venues, age verification, and loyalty rewards. The service uses generative AI to match a camera phone photo of a person's palm to near-infrared imagery from an Amazon One scanner.<br/>
<br/>
The AI system is able to pair palm and vein imagery to create a unique, numerical vector representation that is used for identity matching. Amazon says that it is 99.99 percent accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Palm images taken with the app are encrypted and sent to a secure Amazon One domain in the AWS cloud. Amazon says the service is convenient for consumers and businesses, and that it sees many repeat users at Whole Foods. Amazon One can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for free.

		<description><![CDATA[A lawsuit targeting Apple's refusal to allow apps to support cryptocurrency transactions was today tossed out by a San Francisco judge, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/apple-defeats-consumers-crypto-payment-antitrust-case-now-2024-03-27/">Reuters</a></em>. The lawsuit, which was filed by Venmo and Cash App customers, claimed that Apple drove up the fees charged by Venmo and Cash App by not letting payment apps facilitate cryptocurrency transactions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833990" /><br/>
The plaintiffs alleged that Apple curbed competition in the mobile peer-to-peer payment market with its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> guidelines. No option for cryptocurrency has supposedly caused Venmo and Cash App to raise prices for transactions and services due to "no competitive check." A payment app that is based on decentralized cryptocurrency technology would let <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users "send payments to each other without any intermediary at all."<br/>
<br/>
According to the lawsuit, Venmo, Cash App, PayPal, and other payment providers agreed to an &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; guideline that does not allow for cryptocurrency transactions, which constitutes an "unlawful agreement." Apple asked for the case to be thrown out because the plaintiffs were not able to demonstrate illegal app rules or business agreements, and the judge agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules allow cryptocurrency wallets that store virtual currency, and apps can facilitate cryptocurrency transactions on an approved exchange in countries where the app has licensing and permission to operate a crypto exchange.<br/>
<br/>
The judge overseeing the case called it "speculative" and said it "suffers from several fatal problems." The plaintiffs have been given 21 days to submit an amended complaint, but the judge does not believe the case can be saved.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cryptocurrency/">Cryptocurrency</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/judge-tosses-cryptocurrency-lawsuit/">Judge Tosses Out Cryptocurrency Apple Antitrust Lawsuit Filed by Venmo Customers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/judge-tosses-out-cryptocurrency-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-filed-by-venmo-customers.2423039/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Gurman previously suggested the new iPads would come out in March, and then April, but the timeline has been pushed back once again.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aORut-RwvZg" title="Apple to Launch New iPad Pro &amp; iPad Air Models in May" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Apple is working on updates to both the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will get OLED display technology and the new M3 chips, while the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will come in the standard 10.9-inch size and a larger 12.9-inch size.<br/>
<br/>
According to Gurman, Apple's suppliers are ramping up production of the new iPads at the current time. Apple initially planned to launch the iPads in March or early April, but is apparently working to "finish software for the new devices." The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models also need "complex new manufacturing techniques," which Gurman says has contributed to the delay.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">Apple to Launch New iPad Pro and iPad Air Models in May</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-new-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-models-in-may.2423022/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this month sued its former employee Andrew Aude in California state court, alleging that he breached the company's confidentiality agreement and violated labor laws by leaking sensitive information to the media and employees at other tech companies. Apple has demanded a jury trial, and it is seeking damages in excess of &#36;25,000.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/apple-leak-feature-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-809683" /><br/>
Aude joined Apple as an iOS software engineer in 2016, shortly after graduating college. He worked on optimizing battery performance, making him "privy to information regarding dozens of Apple's most sensitive projects," according to the complaint.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Leaks</h2><br/>
The lawsuit alleges that over a five-year period, Aude used his Apple-issued work iPhone to leak information about more than a half-dozen Apple products and policies, including its then-unannounced Journal app and Vision Pro headset, product development policies, strategies for regulatory compliance, employee headcounts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
In April 2023, for example, Apple alleges that Aude leaked a list of finalized features for the iPhone's Journal app to a journalist at <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> on a phone call. That same month, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Aaron Tilley published a report titled "<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-journaling-app-in-expansion-of-health-initiatives-690b2c8b">Apple Plans iPhone Journaling App in Expansion of Health Initiatives</a>."<br/>
<br/>
Using the encrypted messaging app Signal, Aude is said to have sent "over 1,400" messages to the same journalist, who Aude referred to as "Homeboy." He is also accused of sending "over 10,000 text messages" to another journalist at the website <em>The Information</em>, and he allegedly traveled "across the continent" to meet with her.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Homeboy.jpg" alt="" width="694" height="1452" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944036" /><em>A screenshot included in the lawsuit</em></div><br/>
Other leaks relate to the Vision Pro and other hardware:<blockquote>As another example, an October 2020 screenshot on Mr. Aude's Apple-issued work iPhone shows that he disclosed Apple's development of products within the spatial computing space to a non-Apple employee. Mr. Aude made this disclosure even though Apple's development efforts were confidential and not known to the public. Over the following months, Mr. Aude disclosed additional Apple confidential information—including information concerning unannounced products, and hardware information.</blockquote>Apple believes that Aude's actions were "extensive and purposeful," with Aude allegedly admitting that he  leaked information so he could "kill" products and features with which he took issue. The company alleges that his wrongful disclosures resulted in at least five news articles discussing the company's confidential and proprietary information. Apple says these public revelations impeded its ability to "surprise and delight" with its latest products.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Finds Out</h2><br/>
Apple said it learned of Aude's wrongful disclosures in late 2023, and the company fired him for his alleged misconduct in December of that year.<br/>
<br/>
In a November 2023 interview, Apple alleges that Aude denied leaking confidential information to anyone. However, during that interview, Apple alleges that Aude went to the bathroom and deleted "significant amounts of evidence" from his work iPhone, including the Signal app that he used to communicate with "Homeboy."<br/>
<br/>
During a follow-up interview in December 2023, Apple alleges that Aude admitted to some of his wrongful disclosures, but claims he only provided "narrow admissions limited to the information he had not been able to destroy."<br/>
<br/>
Apple attempted to resolve this matter out of court, but it said Aude was uncooperative:<blockquote>Apple does not bring suit against its former employees lightly. As a result of Mr. Aude's willful destruction of evidence, however, Apple cannot know the universe of what he disclosed to whom and when. Before filing this lawsuit, Apple reached out to Mr. Aude to potentially resolve this matter. Over a month ago, Apple contacted Mr. Aude to understand the full scope of his leaks and ask for his full cooperation in resolving this matter without litigation. Mr. Aude, however, did not commit to cooperating.</blockquote>Aude has also allegedly refused to divest of the restricted Apple stock units that he received as part of his compensation package.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said that Aude poses an "ongoing threat" to the company due to his "long and extensive history of disclosing [confidential information] to third parties intentionally and without authorization, his continued relationships with individuals at other technology companies, and journalists, and his attempts to conceal his misconduct."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is seeking both compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial, and it is also seeking other legal remedies.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today plans to release an Apple Immersive Video that features the best of the 2023 MLS Cup Playoffs. It is the first-ever sports film captured in Apple Immersive Video, and it will be available on the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/vision-pro-mls-immersive-video/">in February said</a> that the MLS Playoffs were recorded in 8K 3D with a 180-degree field of view and Spatial Audio, giving viewers the opportunity to feel "every heart-pounding moment" of the playoffs.<br/>
<br/>
As Jason Snell from <em><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/apples-immersive-mls-highlight-reel-debuts-later-today/">Six Colors</a></em> points out, Apple's video is being released 110 days after the 2023 MLS Cup Final, which is quite the wait. The video is also just five minutes long.<br/>
<br/>
The MLS documentary is set to premiere on the Vision Pro at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time or 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time tonight.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/apple-immersive-video-mls-playoffs/">Apple Immersive Video Featuring 2023 MLS Playoffs Coming to Vision Pro Tonight</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-immersive-video-featuring-2023-mls-playoffs-coming-to-vision-pro-tonight.2423018/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The company behind the new <a href="https://www.clicks.tech/">"Clicks" physical keyboard</a> accessory for the iPhone says it will soon start shipping for a few more models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Clicks-Keyboard-iPhone-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943929" /><br/>
In an email <a href="https://www.threads.net/@parkerortolani/post/C5CkLE-MjZv">shared by Parker Ortolani</a> on Threads this week, the company said the iPhone 15 Pro version of the keyboard will begin shipping to customers worldwide by April 15. And on the Clicks website, the iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max versions of the keyboard are estimated to ship by April 30 and in May, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Clicks started shipping the iPhone 14 Pro version of the keyboard in February, and this is the only model that has arrived to customers so far. The keyboard was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/clicks-iphone-keyboard/">first announced in early January</a>, ahead of the annual CES tech conference.<br/>
<br/>
Inspired by the once-popular BlackBerry smartphone, Clicks is both a physical keyboard and a case for the iPhone. The keyboard connects to the iPhone's USB-C or Lightning port, and it features dedicated keys for emoji and dictation, backlit keys, and a pass-through charging port. Wireless charging is still supported through the case.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Clicks-Keyboard-iPhone.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943927" /><br/>
One advantage of using a physical keyboard with an iPhone is a full-screen experience, as the on-screen keyboard does not appear. There are also keyboard shortcuts, such as CMD-H to return to the Home Screen and CMD-Space to open Spotlight.<br/>
<br/>
The obvious downsides of the keyboard are the added size and weight, but there is a niche market of physical keyboard fans who are willing to put up with these compromises to have an old-school BlackBerry-like typing experience.<br/>
<br/>
Clicks was co-founded by well-known tech personalities "MrMobile" and "CrackBerry Kevin." The keyboard starts at &#36;139 in the U.S., and it is offered in London Sky and BumbleBee color options. It has silicone on the front, and vegan leather on the back. The keyboard is currently sold out, with the company <a href="https://www.clicks.tech/product/clicks-for-iphone">accepting reservations</a> for future availability.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/clicks-keyboard-shipping-soon-for-more-iphones/">BlackBerry-Like &#039;Clicks&#039; Keyboard Shipping for More iPhone Models Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/blackberry-like-clicks-keyboard-shipping-for-more-iphone-models-soon.2423003/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>M3 Max Chip Has Hidden Change That Could Affect Future &#039;M3 Ultra&#039; Chip</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's M3 Ultra chip may be designed as its own, standalone chip, rather than be made up of two M3 Max dies, according to a plausible new theory.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-silicon-1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1422" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924673" /><br/>
The theory comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/maxtechofficial">Max Tech</a>'s <a href="https://twitter.com/VadimYuryev">Vadim Yuryev</a>, who outlined his thinking in a <a href="https://twitter.com/VadimYuryev/status/1773135334567788661">post on X</a> earlier today. Citing a <a href="https://x.com/techanalye1/status/1740142759942750246?s=20">post from @techanalye1</a> which suggests the M3 Max chip no longer features the UltraFusion interconnect, Yuryev postulated that the as-yet-unreleased "M3 Ultra" chip will not be able to comprise two Max chips in a single package. This means that the M3 Ultra is likely to be a standalone chip for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
This would enable Apple to make specific customizations to the M3 Ultra to make it more suitable for intense workflows. For example, the company could omit efficiency cores entirely in favor of an all-performance core design, as well as add even more GPU cores. At minimum, a single M3 Ultra chip designed in this way would be almost certain to offer better performance scaling than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Ultra did compared to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max, since there would no longer be efficiency losses over the UltraFusion interconnect.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, Yuryev speculated that the M3 Ultra could feature its own UltraFusion interconnect, allowing two M3 Ultra dies to be combined in a single package for double the performance in a hypothetical "M3 Extreme" chip. This would enable superior performance scaling compared to packaging four M3 Max dies and open the possibility of even higher amounts of unified memory.<br/>
<br/>
Little is currently known about the M3 Ultra chip, but a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/05/m3-ultra-mac-studio-to-launch-in-mid-2024/">report in January</a> suggested that it will be fabricated using TSMC's N3E node, just like the A18 chip that is expected to debut in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup later in the year. This means it would be Apple's first N3E chip. The M3 Ultra is rumored to launch in a refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> model in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/05/m3-ultra-mac-studio-to-launch-in-mid-2024/">mid-2024</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/m3-max-chip-hidden-change/">M3 Max Chip Has Hidden Change That Could Affect Future &#039;M3 Ultra&#039; Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-max-chip-has-hidden-change-that-could-affect-future-m3-ultra-chip.2423001/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17.4 Seemingly Brings Qi2 Wireless Charging Support to iPhone 12</title>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 17.4 brings support for 15W wireless charging with Qi2 to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12, according to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2280827/iphone-12-qi2-magnetic-wireless-charging-15w.html"><em>Macworld</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iphone-12-preorder-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1213" height="682" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-794852" /><br/>
Qi2 is a next-generation wireless charging technology designed by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) and based on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>. &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; was first introduced on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 and offers speeds of up to 15W. Third-party wireless chargers without &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; certification have been limited to maximum speeds of 7.5W, but Qi2 can reach the full 15W.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-qi-iphone-13-14-models/">enabled 15W speeds</a> with Qi2 wireless chargers on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> via iOS 17.2. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup already supported Qi2 upon launch, leaving the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 as the only &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; without the faster charging capability when using Qi2 accessories.<br/>
<br/>
Citing reader reports and its own tests, <em>Macworld</em> claims that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 is able to charge at 15W when using a Qi2 wireless charger after an update to iOS 17.4. When using a Qi2 charger, the device now displays the animation that only appears when 15W charging is active and tests with the Anker Qi2 MagGo Wireless Charger demonstrated charging speeds in line with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple openly stated that iOS 17.2 brought Qi2 support to the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, but it did not make any such claim about iOS 17.4 and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12. This may be because the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12's wireless charging technology was built around the original Qi standard and &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; before Qi2 was finalized.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qi2/">Qi2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/ios-17-4-qi2-support-iphone-12/">iOS 17.4 Seemingly Brings Qi2 Wireless Charging Support to iPhone 12</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-seemingly-brings-qi2-wireless-charging-support-to-iphone-12.2422995/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's proposed launch schedule for its first foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> has been delayed until 2027 due to technical challenges, claims a report out of Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/foldable-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="1995" height="1057" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872750" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://alphabizkr.com/news/view/1065540605996399">Alpha Biz</a></em> (via <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240327PD207/apple-iphone-titan-foldable-smartphone.html">DigiTimes</a></em>), Apple executives have adjusted the launch schedule for the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from the fourth quarter of 2026 to the first quarter of 2027 following issues with the acquisition of parts, including foldable displays that meet its high standards.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is still in the early stages of developing two foldable smartphones, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-continuing-work-on-folding-iphones/">according to <em>The Information</em></a>. The report said that the two &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; prototypes fold widthwise like a clamshell. More recently, Samsung Securities claimed that Apple's first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will feature a 6-inch external display and an 8-inch main display. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Korean outlet <em>The Elec</em> last month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/">reported</a> that Apple is also considering launching a 7- to 8-inch device that could ultimately replace the 8.3-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the rumors, however, there is increasing skepticism among analysts over whether Apple will abandon its foldable phone in the near term because the company is concerned that existing foldable technology has not yet matured in such a way that would enable it to realize the kind of next-generation application its engineers and designers have in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Only last month a Chinese rumor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/foldable-iphone-paused-failing-screens/">claimed</a> that Apple had suspended its development of a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; after supplier displays failed to pass the company's own stringent testing standards. Apple is said to have been testing rival foldable phones since 2016 as part of its research and development process into foldable devices.<br/>
<br/>
In one cited case, one of the latest folding panels made by Samsung reportedly "broke down after a few days" under Apple's rigorous internal testing, which allegedly caused Apple to put the entire project on ice for the foreseeable future.<br/>
<br/>
The company is seemingly struggling to eliminate the crease that forms in the middle of a display due to repeated folding, and is still working out a design for a hinge that allows the display to lie totally flat, without a bump or dip in the middle. Apple has also been looking at filling panels with polymer materials such as silicone or acrylate to reduce light reflection issues.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/foldable-iphone-launch-delayed-early-2027/">Foldable iPhone Could Arrive in 2027 or Be Postponed Indefinitely</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-could-arrive-in-2027-or-be-postponed-indefinitely.2422988/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-updates-summer-travel-2024/">today announced</a> several changes that it is making to the Google Maps platform, including an AI update. Google Maps now provides better at-a-glance information on locations, with the details powered by Google AI.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Google-maps-feaure-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793592" /><br/>
Maps shows photo highlights and reviews that summarize what people like about a location. A restaurant's food items can be identified using AI, and Google Maps will also provide cost, potential availability, and whether or not it caters to dietary restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
Google says that it will now be easier to discover helpful recommendation lists from top sites and the Google Maps community in select cities in the U.S. and Canada. To use the feature, search for a city and swipe to see curated lists of recommendations from people familiar with the city. There are also Trending, Top, and Gems lists that highlight popular locations to visit when traveling. The feature is available in 40 cities this week, with more coming in the future.<br/>
<br/>
To go along with the change to recommendations, Google is adding new customization tools for creating lists in Maps. Google Maps users can choose the order that places appear in their created lists to rank them, and there are options to link content from social channels. Google says that the list updates will be rolling out on Android and iOS later this month.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Google Maps users can expect to see a refreshed design that includes a cleaner home screen with fewer tabs and new pin colors that make it easier to find places on the map.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/google-maps-ai-tools-list-updates/">Google Maps Gains New AI Tools, Updated Recommendation Lists and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-gains-new-ai-tools-updated-recommendation-lists-and-more.2422969/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and app ecosystem undergoing major changes in the European Union, <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-turns-to-longtime-steve-jobs-disciple-to-defend-its-walled-garden-2ab44fae">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> today shared a profile on &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/">Phil Schiller</a>, who is responsible for the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/applephilschiller.jpg" alt="Phil Schiller" width="1960" height="1300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752890" /><br/>
Though Schiller transitioned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/04/phil-schiller-apple-fellow/">from marketing chief</a> to "Apple Fellow" in 2020 to take a step back from Apple and spend more time on personal projects and friends, he is reportedly working close to 80 hours a week.<br/>
<br/>
Schiller is known for responding to emails almost immediately, and answering phone calls at all hours. He <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/phil-schiller-epic-games-v-apple/">testified during the Epic v. Apple lawsuit</a> to ardently defend the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and he is involved in Apple's EU messaging as well. Schiller joined in on Apple PR calls with members of the media when the iOS 17.4 changes were announced, and he spent time explaining how the DMA will impact user privacy and security in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
When Apple terminated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/apple-explains-terminating-epic-games-account/">Epic Games developer account</a> in March to prevent it from creating an alternate app marketplace, it was Schiller <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/apple-reinstates-epic-games-developer-account-eu/">who sent an email</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> CEO Tim Sweeney to suggest that the account had been shut down because of Epic's criticism of Apple's DMA compliance. Schiller's email did not go over well with the European Commission, and Apple ultimately reversed its decision.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> defers to Schiller when it comes to &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; matters. Schiller joined Apple back in 1987, left in 1993, and returned in 1997 when Steve Jobs came back to Apple. He has been at the forefront of some of Apple's biggest product launches, developing marketing strategies for everything from the iPod to the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
He was one of the main supporters of adding third-party apps to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, working to convince Jobs to launch the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in 2008. Known as a Jobs "mini-me," Schiller has reportedly kept Jobs' philosophy alive at Apple. Under his watch, human review has remained a key part of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; has grown into a major revenue stream for Apple.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[At least some Apple software engineers continue to believe that iOS 18 will be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/">"biggest" update in the iPhone's history</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. Below, we recap rumored features and changes for the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943113" /><br/>
"The iOS 18 update is expected to be the most ambitious overhaul of the iPhone's software in its history, according to people working on the upgrade," wrote Gurman, in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/apple-set-to-unveil-ai-strategy-at-june-10-developers-conference">report focused on WWDC 2024</a>. Apple recently said that its annual developers conference <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">will run from June 10 through June 14</a>, and iOS 18 will be a key announcement.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include new generative AI features for Siri and many apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also expected to introduce a more customizable Home Screen and other user interface design changes, new features in apps like Apple Maps and Freeform, additional accessibility features, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smarter Siri and Generative AI</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840591" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, according to sources such as Gurman and <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly teased that the company is working on generative AI, and plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year,"</a> and Apple's marketing chief Greg Joswiak also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-ios-18-ai-wwdc-2024/">hinted at AI this week</a> in a social media post about WWDC 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other text prompts. The company has also expanded into generative AI tools for images and videos. Other companies like Google and Microsoft have also pushed into the generative AI space, and the technology is quickly evolving.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/ios-18-reportedly-wont-have-apple-chatbot/">not expected to include Apple's own ChatGPT-like chatbot</a>. Instead, Apple has reportedly held discussions with companies <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/">such as OpenAI, Google, and China's Baidu</a> about potential generative AI partnerships, which could lead to other chatbots being integrated into iOS 18, although Apple's exact plans are unclear.<br/>
<br/>
Some generative AI features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">might be exclusive to iPhone 16 Pro models</a>, which are rumored to have a Neural Engine with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" more cores</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Customizable Home Screen</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-Home-Screen-Gradient-Blank-Spaces-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943087" /><br/>
iOS 18 will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-more-customizable-home-screen-rumor/">"more customizable" Home Screen</a>, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> exclusively reported that iOS 18 will finally allow users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-home-screen-app-icon-customization/">place app icons anywhere on the Home Screen grid</a>. This means that users will be able to create blank spaces, columns, and rows between app icons. This basic feature has long been available on Android smartphones, and now Apple is bringing it to the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone users can already customize the Home Screen with apps such as Shortcuts and Widgetsmith, which can be used to create "blank" app icons and widgets, but Apple's official solution will be much more convenient.<br/>
<br/>
We expect iOS 18 to include additional customization options beyond icon arrangement, as part of the biggest Home Screen revamp in years.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Apple Maps Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-maps-3d-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="896" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-841030" /><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> recently revealed two potential new Apple Maps features coming with iOS 18: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-maps-custom-routes-ios-18/">custom routes</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/">topographic maps</a>.<br/>
<br/>
With the custom routes feature, Apple Maps users would be able to choose specific roads to travel on while navigating, for reasons such as familiarity or scenic views. This feature is expected to be available in the U.S. only at launch. Google Maps already allows users to create custom routes on the web, and then view them on an iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
Topographic maps first debuted on the Apple Watch last year with watchOS 10, and code suggests that the feature will be expanded to the iPhone, Mac, and Vision Pro with iOS 18, macOS 15, and visionOS 2. These maps include details such as trails, contour lines, elevation, and points of interest for hiking and other outdoor uses.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design Changes</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-Design-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940300" /><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">update the design of the iOS user interface</a> as "early as this year," according to Gurman. He previously said that iOS 18 would have "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">major new features and designs</a>," but he has yet to provide any specific details.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Rumors</h2><br/>
<ul><li>iOS 18 may have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/">new accessibility features tied to VoiceOver, Live Speech, and Text Size</a>.</li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/airpods-pro-to-gain-hearing-aid-mode-ios-18/">AirPods Pro are expected to get a new hearing aid mode</a> with iOS 18.</li><br/>
<li>iOS 18 may have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/ios-18-macos-15-freeform-app-scenes/">updated Freeform app with a new "Scenes" feature</a>.</li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/17/apple-id-rebrand-to-apple-account-ios-18/">"Apple ID" is expected to be rebranded to "Apple Account"</a> starting with iOS 18.</li><br/>
<li>iOS 18 is rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ios-18-compatible-iphones-rumor/">compatible with the same iPhone models as iOS 17</a>.</li></ul>For additional information, read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18 roundup</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/what-to-expect-from-ios-18/">iOS 18: What to Expect From &#039;Biggest&#039; Update in iPhone&#039;s History</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-what-to-expect-from-biggest-update-in-iphones-history.2422958/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular accessory brand Mophie today announced the launch of new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> charging products that use the new Qi2 wireless charging standard. Qi2 is similar to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> in that it is able to charge compatible &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models at up to 15W rather than being limited to 7.5W.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Mophie-Qi2-accessories.jpg" alt="" width="1829" height="1029" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908525" /><br/>
The &#36;70 <a href="https://www.zagg.com/snap-charging-vent-mount/">Snap+ Wireless Charging Vent Mount</a> is designed for use in the car. It is able to attach to a vehicle's vents, and it comes with a 30W USB-C car adapter and USB-C cable. A MagSafe-compatible &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is able to attach to the charger magnetically, and it will charge at 15W.<br/>
<br/>
Mophie's Snap+ Wireless Charging Vent Mount <a href="https://www.zagg.com/snap-charging-vent-mount/">is available today</a>, and two other products are coming in April. The &#36;130 <a href="https://www.zagg.com/snap-3-in-1-wireless-charge-stand/">Snap+ 3-in-1 Wireless Charge Stand</a> has an upright 15W Qi2 charging pad that works in landscape or portrait mode, plus it can be tilted to an ideal viewing angle.<br/>
<br/>
There's also an Apple Watch charging puck that can fast charge compatible Apple Watch models at 7.5W, and a 5W charging platform at the bottom that is designed to work with AirPods. All three devices can charge at one time.<br/>
<br/>
Mophie's &#36;70 <a href="https://www.zagg.com/snap-powerstation-mini-with-stand/">Snap+ Powerstation Mini with Stand</a> is a charging stand that comes with a 5,000mAh internal battery for charging the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; while on the go. Like Mophie's other Qi2 products, it is able to charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at up to 15W. The Powerstation Mini and 3-in-1 Charge Stand will launch on April 30.<br/>
<br/>
Qi2 products from Mophie and other manufacturers are compatible with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to be gearing up to add topographic maps to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> apps in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, macOS 15, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2, according to code reviewed by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/watchos-10-maps-app.jpg" alt="" width="1894" height="1065" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900631" /><br/>
First introduced with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, topographic maps include trails, contour lines, elevation, and points of interest, features that are of use for hiking and other outdoor activities where accurate navigation is essential.<br/>
<br/>
Since debuting topographic maps, Apple has been expanding support throughout the United States, and this year, Apple may be ready to bring it to iOS, macOS, and &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Backend topographic maps code was introduced last year, but only &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; had the feature. The code was dormant on iOS and macOS at that time, but in the backend files for &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, macOS 15, and &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 2, the code is active, suggesting an expansion.<br/>
<br/>
The possibility of topographic maps follows our report yesterday on another possible &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; feature, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-maps-custom-routes-ios-18/">support for custom routes</a>. With custom routes, users will presumably be able to create their own routes without being limited to Apple's pre-selected options.<br/>
<br/>
‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;‌ will be introduced at the Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, June 10, and it appears there will be quite a few new features for &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj;. For more details about the update, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">check out our iOS 18 roundup</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that three more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> games will be available on the Vision Pro headset starting this Thursday, March 28.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Altos-Odyssey-The-Lost-City-Vision-Pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943720" /><em>Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City on Apple Vision Pro</em></div><br/>
The titles coming to the Vision Pro tomorrow include popular endless runner game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/altos-odyssey-remastered/id1538650027">Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City</a>, hand-drawn adventure game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gibbon-beyond-the-trees/id1482634476">Gibbon: Beyond the Trees</a>, and physics-based puzzler <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spire-blast/id1532717034">Spire Blast</a>. All three games are already available on Apple Arcade on other devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.<br/>
<br/>
"On March 28, players can soar above windswept dunes in a fantastical place far from home in Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City, dive into an immersive jungle with a family of gibbons in the 2022 Apple Design Award winning Gibbon: Beyond the Trees, and collapse vibrant towers of all shapes and sizes that appear in their physical space in the fun physics-based puzzle game Spire Blast," said Apple, in an email about the games.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's brand new 13-inch 256GB M3 MacBook Air has hit <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX23V2ZK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;999.00</strong></a> today on Amazon, down from &#36;1,099.00. This sale is available in Midnight, but you might be able to get in Space Gray depending on stock, which has been fluctuating today. <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1814977-REG/apple_mrxv3ll_a_13_6_macbook_air_m3.html/BI/2696/KBID/3612/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1429879/SID/DFF">B&H Photo is matching this sale</a>.<br/>

<br/>
This is a new all-time low price on the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air, and it accompanies a similarly steep discount on the 15-inch model that we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/low-price-15-inch-m3-macbook-air-2/">started tracking last week</a>. In that sale, you can get the 15-inch 256GB M3 MacBook Air for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX251F4X%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,204.00</strong></a>, a &#36;95 discount.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX23V2ZK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>13-inch M3 MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;999.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
These MacBook Air models just launched earlier in the month, coming in both 13-inch and 15-inch sizes. Both of the new MacBook Air machines include the M3 chip and focus on internal upgrades. Apple did not change the design of the MacBook Air with the 2024 update, using the same design that was first introduced in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Because of these new MacBook Air models, we're also tracking <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/best-buys-sale-ipads-playstation/">record low prices on previous generation models</a>. Best Buy currently has both the 13-inch and 15-inch M2 MacBook Air at all-time low prices, with up to &#36;300 off select computers. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Pay's Express Mode has rolled out to all TTC subway stations in Toronto, allowing riders to simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near the reader at the turnstile to pay for their fare. With Express Mode, payment can be completed without waking or unlocking the device, or authenticating with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. Express Mode even works for up to five hours after an iPhone has run out of battery power.<br/>
<br/>

As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewe/status/1772056065296752816">Toronto resident Andrew Escobar</a>, it is still not possible to add a PRESTO card to the Apple Wallet app, so Express Mode is limited to credit and debit cards added to the Wallet app for now. Public documents related to recent TTC meetings suggest that the PRESTO card will gain Apple Wallet support later this year.<br/>
<br/>
To set up a credit or debit card for use with Apple Pay, open the Wallet app on the iPhone, tap the plus sign in the top-right corner, and follow the on-screen instructions. To set a payment card as the default option for Express Mode, open the Settings app on the iPhone, tap Wallet & Apple Pay, tap Express Transit Card, and select a card.<br/>
<br/>
Some payment readers elsewhere in the TTC system already worked with Apple Pay's Express Mode. Apple periodically updates a list of locations where Apple Pay's Express Mode is available for transit on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#apple-wallet-transit">iOS feature availability page</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/apple-pay-express-mode-ttc-subway-stations/">Apple Pay Express Mode Now Available at All Toronto Subway Stations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-express-mode-now-available-at-all-toronto-subway-stations.2422945/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
