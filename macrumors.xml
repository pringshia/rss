		<description><![CDATA[Amazon has introduced a new all-time low price on the Apple Studio Display, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,249.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.00. This is the standard glass version of the Studio Display with the tilt adjustable stand, and right now it's the only model on Amazon at a record low price.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/studio-display-new-purple.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991273" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Compared to past sales, this is &#36;50 under the previous all-time low price and as of writing only Amazon has the deal. There's an estimated delivery window of late March for most residences in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;350 OFF</div>Standard Glass Apple Studio Display for &#36;1,249.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The Studio Display features a 27-inch 5K Retina display with a 5120 x 2880 resolution and up to 600 nits of brightness. Apple says that the standard display is engineered for "extremely low reflectivity," but for rooms where there is a lot of glare, Apple suggests the nano-texture glass option with even less reflectivity.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-9a-the-latest-a-series-phone-with-google-ai-smarts-at-an-unbeatable-value/">introduced</a> the Pixel 9a, its latest lower-priced smartphone. The device is launching in April, and it will compete with Apple's new iPhone 16e.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Google-Pixel-9a.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995734" /><br/>
In terms of specs and pricing, the Pixel 9a tops the iPhone 16e in at least four ways.<br/>
<br/>
First, the Pixel 9a's 6.3-inch OLED display is larger than the iPhone 16e's 6.1-inch screen.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the Pixel 9a's display supports up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and content, while the iPhone 16e is limited to 60Hz. <br/>
<br/>
Third, while both the Pixel 9a and the iPhone 16e are equipped with a 48-megapixel main rear camera, the Pixel 9a also has an Ultra Wide camera.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, the Pixel 9a starts at &#36;499 in the U.S., while the iPhone 16e starts at &#36;599.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the Pixel 9a runs Android, which is simply a dealbreaker for many iPhone users who prefer the Apple ecosystem or feel too locked in to bother switching platforms. But, increased competition is always good to see.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The European Commission today announced the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_816">decisions of its interoperability proceedings</a> to assist Apple in complying with its obligations under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), but Apple has come out swinging, calling them "bad for our products and bad for our European users."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
The DMA, which came into force last year, requires major platform holders or "gatekeepers" like Apple to provide third-party developers <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/questions-and-answers/interoperability_en">equal access to iOS and iPadOS system tools and features</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The Commission's first proceeding focused on iOS connectivity features for third-party connected devices like smartwatches, headphones, and virtual reality headsets. The decisions specify how Apple will provide effective interoperability for functionalities such as notifications, device pairing, and connectivity and data transfer functions like AirDrop and AirPlay.<br/>
<blockquote>The measures will grant device manufacturers and app developers improved access to iPhone features that interact with such devices (e.g. displaying notifications on smartwatches), faster data transfers (e.g. peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections, and near-field communication) and easier device set-up (e.g. pairing).</blockquote>The second proceeding focused on the process Apple has set up to address interoperability requests submitted by developers and third parties for iOS and iPadOS.  <br/>
<blockquote>Developers will benefit from a fast and fair handling of their interoperability requests. The measures will accelerate their ability to offer a wider choice to European consumers of innovative services and hardware that interoperate with iPhones and iPads.</blockquote>The final measures set out in the two specification decisions follow an extensive engagement with Apple and input by third parties as part of the public consultation launched in December 2024.<br/>
<br/>
However, according to Apple, the DMA effectively requires it to hand over intellectual property to competitors, including companies whose business model relies on copying others. This intervention, argues the company, allows officials or third parties to influence iPhone development to the point of micromanagement, making it harder to introduce new technologies in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also expressed its concern that some data-driven companies are exploiting the DMA to bypass EU data protection standards, and seeking unfettered access to user devices and data, including unencrypted access to user notifications and details on connected Wi-Fi networks — amongst other privacy and security risks Apple flagged in its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/DMA-Interoperability-Dec-2024.pdf">December 2024 report</a>, which specifically calls out Meta.<br/>
<br/>
To comply with the DMA, Apple launched a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/ios-interoperability/">portal</a> for EU developers to request additional interoperability with iOS and iPadOS. With over 250,000 APIs, the company believes it already provides third-party developers with robust tools for interoperability while protecting user data. <br/>
<blockquote>"Today's decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple's ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don't have to play by the same rules," said Apple in a statement given to MacRumors. "It's bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users." </blockquote>Apple said it has worked extensively with the Commission to comply with the DMA, and dedicated up to 500 engineers to the effort. The company believes it has met all requirements, and will continue engaging with regulators. But it's unconvinced the current demands will foster competition or innovation as intended.<br/>
<blockquote>Today's decisions mark the first time the Commission outlines concrete measures for a gatekeeper to comply with the Digital Markets Act," said Teresa Ribera, executive VP for clean, just and competitive transition. "Companies operating in the EU, irrespective of their place of incorporation, must comply with EU rules, including the Digital Markets Act. With these decision, we are simply implementing the law, and providing regulatory certainty both to Apple and to developers. Effective interoperability for third-party connected devices is an important step towards opening Apple's ecosystem. This will lead to a better choice for consumers in the fast-growing market for innovative connected devices. Also, from now on, developers will enjoy more transparency as to how their interoperability requests are handled by Apple. Today moves us closer to ensuring a level playing field in Europe, thanks to the rule of law. </blockquote>The DMA's specification decisions are legally binding and Apple is required to implement the specified measures. However, the Commission says the decisions "fully respect Apple's rights of defense" and remain subject to independent judicial scrutiny.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/apple-eu-interoperability-bad-for-products-users/">Apple Says New EU Interoperability Rules &#039;Bad for Our Products and Our Users&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-new-eu-interoperability-rules-bad-for-our-products-and-our-users.2453496/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
Amazon has all four colors of the 128GB Wi-Fi iPad mini 7 on sale at this price, and it's a match of the best price we've ever tracked on the tablet. You can also get the 256GB Wi-Fi iPad mini 7 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DK3WGKKB%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;499.00</strong></a> and the 512GB Wi-Fi iPad mini 7 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DK3XHBH9%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;699.99</strong></a>, both &#36;100 discounts and available in multiple colors.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In select U.S. states, residents can <a href="https://learn.wallet.apple/id">add their driver's license or state ID to the Wallet app</a> on the iPhone and Apple Watch, providing a convenient and contactless way to display proof of identity or age at select airports and businesses, and in select apps.<br/>

Unfortunately, this feature continues to roll out very slowly. It has been three and a half years since Apple first announced the feature in September 2021, and only nine U.S. states and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico offer it.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Serial leaker Sonny Dickson today <a href="https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1902211234369581548">shared</a> an image of what he claims is a first look at a third-party case for Apple's iPhone 17 Air. "If you didn’t know an Air was coming, you'd swear it was a Google Pixel case," he said.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-17-Air-Fanned-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989999" /><br/>
Case manufacturers often obtain design specifications of upcoming iPhone models before their release by collaborating with Apple through official partnerships or conducting on-site investigations in production facilities. Observing production trends and prototypes in these areas helps them anticipate design changes.<br/>
<br/>
The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a distinctive camera module design characterized by a horizontal "camera bar" that spans the width of the device's upper rear section. The design is reminiscent of Google's Pixel series and represents a departure from previous iPhone camera layouts.<br/>
<br/>
Leaked renders suggest that the camera bar will house a single rear camera lens, positioned on the left side, with the flash located on the far right. The overall aesthetic is sleek and minimalist, in line with the iPhone 17 Air's ultra-thin profile, which is reported to be approximately 5.5mm thick.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iphone-17-air-case.jpg" alt="" width="3072" height="4096" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995689" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>iPhone 17 Air case (Image: Sonny Dickson)</em></div><br/>
Despite its minimalism, the device is expected to feature MagSafe, an Action button, and a Camera Control button – as indicated by the cutout on the lower left side of the case shown in the above image. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/">report at the weekend</a> said the iPhone 17 Air will have a Camera Control button, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-magsafe-action-button/">dummy models previously shared by Dickson</a> reflect this.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 6.6-inch display with 120Hz ProMotion support, a Dynamic Island, a standard A19 chip rather than an A19 Pro chip, a 48-megapixel rear camera, Apple's custom-made C1 modem, and no physical SIM card slot worldwide. As usual, Apple should announce its new iPhone lineup around mid-September.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonny-dickson/">Sonny Dickson</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/first-iphone-17-air-case-camera-bar-cutout/">First iPhone 17 Air Case Has Camera Bar, Camera Control Button Cutouts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-iphone-17-air-case-has-camera-bar-camera-control-button-cutouts.2453488/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In macOS, you can easily convert the format of images using a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/convert-images-macos-finder/">Quick Action</a> in Finder or you can achieve the same thing via the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/batch-convert-images-to-different-formats-using-macos-preview/">Preview app</a>, but if your daily workflow requires you to repeatedly convert images – for uploading to a blog, for example – then using a Folder Action can be a much faster way of getting the job done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/finder-images-folder.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995683" /><br/>
In this article, we'll show you how to use the macOS Automator app to create a very simple Folder Action that will automatically convert images dropped into a specific folder, without you having to manually apply a Quick Action or open an image editing app. Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Create an Image Converting Folder in Automator</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Launch <strong>Automator</strong> from the Applications folder.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/finder-automator.jpg" alt="" width="2846" height="1404" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995685" /><br/>
<li>Click <strong>New Document</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Choose <strong>Folder Action</strong> as the type of your document.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/folder-action-automator.jpg" alt="automator" width="523" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884194" /><br/>
<li>At the top of the workflow area, click the dropdown next to <strong>Folder Action receives files and folders added to:</strong> then select <strong>Other...</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/folder-action-1.jpg" alt="automator" width="1000" height="187" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884198" /><br/>
<li>Select the folder that you'd like to attribute the image conversion action to. In our example, we're choosing the Downloads folder.</li><br/>
<li>From the <strong>Library</strong> sidebar on the far left, select <strong>Photos</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>From the <strong>Actions</strong> column, drag <strong>Change Type of Images</strong> (the one with the Preview icon) to the workflow area.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/change-image-type.jpg" alt="automator" width="1000" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884199" /><br/>
<li>A dialog prompt will appear. If you want your action to convert copies of images placed in the folder and preserve the originals, select <strong>Add</strong>. If you want it to convert the original images, select <strong>Don't Add</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>In the <strong>Change Type of Images</strong> action panel, choose the type of format that you want images to be converted to. We're selecting <strong>JPG</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/convert-jpg-action.jpg" alt="automator" width="613" height="112" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884200" /><br/>
<li>In the Automator menu bar, select <strong>File -> Save...</strong> or press <strong>Command-S</strong>, call your new file action "Convert Image," then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>That's all there is to it. Next time you want to convert an image into your preferred format, simply drag it into the folder that you assigned the action to. <br/>
<br/>
Now that you know how to create the image conversion workflow in Automator, you may want to turn it into a standalone "Application," the option for which you can find in Automator's document menu. An "Application" is a self-running workflow that acts as a droplet – any files or folders dropped onto it are used as input to the workflow. In other words, you could add an "Application" to your Dock and drop images onto it for conversion.<br/>
<br/>
You can also import Automator workflows into the Shortcuts app. Shortcuts can convert most Automator workflows into shortcuts that carry out the same functions, events and automations — you simply drag a workflow file into Shortcuts and the conversion happens automatically. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/automator/">Automator</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/turn-macos-folder-into-image-converter-how/">Turn Any macOS Folder Into an Image Converter – Here&#039;s How</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/turn-any-macos-folder-into-an-image-converter-–-heres-how.2453484/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple fixed a bug in its Passwords app with December's iOS 18.2 update that had left users vulnerable to phishing attacks in the three months since the launch of iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Generic-iOS-18-Passwords-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959050" /><br/>
According to an Apple security update spotted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/18/apples-passwords-app-was-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks-for-nearly-three-months-after-launch/">9to5Mac</a></em>, the Passwords app was sending unencrypted requests for the logos and icons associated with users' stored passwords.<br/>
<br/>
Without protections of encryption, an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network could redirect a user's browser to a clone phishing site where login details could be stolen. The vulnerability was first discovered by developer Mysk's security researchers and reported in September.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iOS 18.2 security release notes described the bug like so:<br/>
<blockquote>Impact: A user in a privileged network position may be able to leak sensitive information<br/>
<br/>
Description: This issue was addressed by using HTTPS when sending information over the network.</blockquote><div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VUSB3FK1dKA?si=Z6oaAETbWB3SD4ro" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Along with a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple is working on a larger foldable device that's somewhere around 19 inches, but rumors have been split on whether it's an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> or a Mac. Some reports refer to the device as an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, while some call it a Mac, and the split seems to come down to the operating system on the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-Fold-Vertical-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988570" /><br/>
<h2>Is it a Mac?</h2><br/>
Some rumors have suggested that Apple is developing a foldable MacBook with an all-display design. The MacBook already has a foldable design, of course, but the difference here would be a single display without an included keyboard and trackpad.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Foldable-Screen-MacBook-Concept-Astropad.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952144" /><br/>
A foldable Mac would be able to be folded in half and used like a traditional MacBook with a virtual keyboard, or it could be unfolded and used as a display when paired with an external keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has referred to Apple's larger foldable device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/20-inch-foldable-macbook-crease-free-rumor/">as a MacBook</a>, and he thinks it's going to have an 18.8 to 20.2-inch display. Display analyst Ross Young has also written about Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/18-8-inch-foldable-macbook-rumor/">work on a notebook</a> with an 18.8-inch display.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> said in December that Apple is working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/iphone-17-air-19-inch-macbook-report/">a 19-inch MacBook</a> with a foldable screen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Is it an iPad?</h2><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has referred to Apple's large-screened foldable device as an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and he says it's going to have a display that's around 20 inches in size.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/FoldPad-Redux-24-Magenta-and-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934078" /><br/>
<em>The Elec</em> said in 2022 that Apple was developing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-20-inch-display-future-macbook-pro/">a foldable device</a> around 20 inches in size that folds down to 15.3 inches, and research firm Omdia believes that Apple is working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-oled-roadmap/">20.3-inch foldable OLED iPad</a> that will be positioned as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While Kuo has also mainly referred to Apple's foldable as a MacBook, in 2023, he called it an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and said that it would come with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/foldable-ipad-kickstand-2024/">carbon fiber kickstand</a>. Of course, Kuo initially said that such a foldable would come in 2024, something that did not happen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Or both?</h2><br/>
When thinking of a foldable with an all-display design, it's easier to picture an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, which is already a single screen. It makes sense for Apple to create an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that's able to fold down for portability and then unfold into a larger workspace, but what if it runs macOS?<br/>
<br/>
We don't have much of a reference for an all-display Mac since it's not a form factor we're familiar with, but a 20-inch device that's all display and folds in half would definitely be something of a hybrid &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Mac device.<br/>
<br/>
Analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/">recently said</a> that Apple's large-screened foldable will be a MacBook-iPad hybrid that's likely to run macOS, rather than iPadOS. Such a device would presumably have a touchscreen, and would require notable changes to the Mac operating system as it does not support touch input. Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/ios-19-big-design-changes/">also claimed</a> that some of the design updates that Apple is making in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> and macOS 16 to unify the operating systems will pave the way for foldable devices and touchscreen Macs, so a hybrid is a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the large-screened foldable is ultimately an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or a Mac will come down to the operating system that Apple is planning to use. If the device runs macOS, it'll be in the Mac family, and if it runs iPadOS, it'll be in the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; family.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Launch Date</h2><br/>
Rumors about the release date for Apple's foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;/Mac have targeted as early as 2026 to as late as 2028, so it's not quite clear when we'll see the device. It's possible that Apple is planning a launch for as soon as next year, and if that's the case, rumors should really start picking up in the next couple of months.<br/>
<br/>
If we don't start hearing more soon, we can assume that Apple is aiming for a later launch date in 2027 or beyond.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/apple-foldable-ipad-or-mac/">Will Apple&#039;s Large-Screened Foldable be an iPad or a Mac?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-apples-large-screened-foldable-be-an-ipad-or-a-mac.2453448/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.3.1, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.3.2 are no longer able to downgrade to the prior version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple released iOS 18.3.2 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/apple-releases-ios-18-3-2/">on March 10</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iOS-18.3.1-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988425" /><br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS after releasing an update. Software that is not signed cannot be installed on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; due to a server-side verification check, and it keeps &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users from installing outdated versions of iOS. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models compatible with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; are only eligible to download and run iOS 18.3.2 at this time.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Nanoleaf today announced the launch of the PC Screen Mirror Lightstrip, a new desktop lighting option that is designed to make desktop gaming and entertainment more immersive with rainbow lighting effects.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/nanoleaf-light-strip.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995652" /><br/>
The Screen Mirror Lightstrip connects to a computer using USB-C, and it is able to provide real-time dynamic mirroring that matches whatever is on your screen. It can match the output of a game or a movie, or it can sync to music, with the lights changing to match the rhythm of a song. With a Nanoleaf Premium subscription, there is an Orchestrator mode that provides access to different moods for music experience customization.<br/>
<br/>
Nanoleaf designed the Screen Mirror Lightstrip for displays up to 32 inches in size, and it features a flexible zigzag design for simple and precise installation.<br/>
<br/>
The Lightstrip pairs to a display using the Nanoleaf Desktop app, which is available for both PCs and Macs. More than 16 million colors are supported for dynamic lighting animations and visual effects.<br/>
<br/>
The PC Screen Mirror Lightstrip from Nanoleaf is priced at &#36;50 and it can be <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/essentials/lightstrips/pc-screen-mirror-lightstrip/">pre-ordered from the Nanoleaf website</a>. It is set to ship at the end of March.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/nanoleaf-screen-mirror-lightstrip/">Nanoleaf Launches New Screen Mirror Lightstrip for Mac Displays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nanoleaf-launches-new-screen-mirror-lightstrip-for-mac-displays.2453442/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Next Year&#039;s iPhone 18 Pro Already Rumored to Have Five New Features</title>

		<description><![CDATA[While the iPhone 18 Pro models are still around a year and a half away from launching, there are already some early rumors about the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-ghost-hand.jpg" alt="" width="1785" height="1004" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-966100" /><br/>
Below, we recap some key iPhone 18 Pro rumors so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Under-Screen Face ID</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/face-id.jpg" alt="" width="1023" height="573" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-966000" /><br/>
In April 2023, display industry analyst Ross Young shared a roadmap showing that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro models would feature under-display Face ID</a>. In May 2024, however, Young said he heard this change had been <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1786098652420911128">delayed until 2026</a>. If so, that means that under-screen Face ID could debut on the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max next year.<br/>
<br/>
Even with under-screen Face ID, it is expected that the Dynamic Island will live on, but it might become smaller. Alternatively, the iPhone 18 Pro models could have only a pinhole at the top of the display for the front camera, similar to Android smartphones like Google's Pixel 9 and Samsung's Galaxy S25. It's too early to know yet.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Variable Aperture</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-design-cameras.jpg" alt="" width="923" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-966096" /><br/>
The main 48-megapixel Fusion camera on both iPhone 18 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/iphone-18-pro-rumored-camera-upgrade/">will offer variable aperture</a>, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
With variable aperture, users would be able to control the amount of light that passes through the camera's lens and reaches the sensor. The main cameras on iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro models have a fixed aperture of ƒ/1.78, and the lens is always fully open and shooting with this widest aperture. With the iPhone 18 Pro models, users would be able to manually change the aperture, according to this rumor.<br/>
<br/>
A variable aperture on iPhone 18 Pro models should provide users with greater control over depth of field, which refers to how sharp a subject appears in the foreground compared to the background. However, given that iPhones have smaller image sensors due to size restraints, it is unclear exactly how meaningful this improvement would be.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Samsung Image Sensor</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/iphone-12-pro-max-sensor-shift.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-771522" /><br/>
Samsung is developing a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-18-samsung-camera-sensor-report/">three-layer stacked camera sensor</a> that Apple is expected to use for iPhone 18 Pro models, according to <em>DigiTimes</em>. This advanced image sensor would make the iPhone 18's camera more responsive, and offer other benefits like reduced noise in photos, increased dynamic range, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The exact technology is called "PD-TR-Logic," according to a <a href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1874358213011005628">leaker known as "Jukanlosreve"</a>, and it refers to a camera sensor with three layers of circuitry affixed to it.<br/>
<br/>
Sony has long been the exclusive supplier of image sensors for iPhone cameras, so Samsung entering the fray would be notable.<br/>
<br/>
In July 2024, Kuo said he expected Samsung to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/2026-iphone-48mp-camera-sensor-samsung/">begin shipping 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera sensors to Apple</a> for iPhones as early as 2026, which is when the iPhone 18 Pro models are expected to be released.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>C2 Modem</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-c1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990815" /><br/>
Apple debuted its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">custom-designed C1 modem</a> in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> last month, as part of a multi-year plan to transition away from Qualcomm modems.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's second-generation C2 modem will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-18-pro-c2-modem-rumor/">debut in the iPhone 18 Pro models</a> next year, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. Unsurprisingly, expect the C2 modem to be faster than the C1, and for it to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/">gain mmWave support</a> in the United States. Further power efficiency improvements are likely too.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>A20 Pro Chip With Apple Intelligence Upgrade</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-iPhone-16.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964551" /><br/>
Apple's A20 Pro chip for the iPhone 18 Pro models will be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, despite an initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/iphone-18-enhanced-2nm-chip-12gb-ram/">2nm rumor</a>, according to Pu. That is the same process that is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/">expected to be used for the A19 Pro chip</a> coming in the iPhone 17 Pro models, so the iPhone 18 Pro models could have relatively small overall performance improvements compared to the previous generation.<br/>
<br/>
Pu does expect the A20 Pro chip to have one upgrade that he said will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/a20-chip-still-3nm-rumor/">benefit Apple Intelligence capabilities</a>. Specifically, he said the chip will use TSMC's so-called <a href="https://3dfabric.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/technology/cowos.htm">Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS)</a> packaging technology, which would allow for tighter integration of the chip's processor, unified memory, and Neural Engine.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/iphone-18-pro-rumors/">Next Year&#039;s iPhone 18 Pro Already Rumored to Have Five New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-years-iphone-18-pro-already-rumored-to-have-five-new-features.2453438/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> today expanded to Puerto Rico, which means <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac users living in the territory are now able to use &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; for purchases in retail stores and online, even without a mainland credit or debit card. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/apple-pay-puerto-rico.jpg" alt="" width="1641" height="923" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995614" /><br/>
Though Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; was not previously available for Puerto Rico banks, though Puerto Ricans have had access to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> and have been able to use &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; with U.S. credit and debit cards. <br/>
<br/>
As of right now, Banco Popular in Puerto Rico supports &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, so Banco Popular cardholders in the territory can add eligible cards to the Wallet app to use as a contactless payment method. Banco Popular cards are able to be used at any location that accepts &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first launched &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; in 2014, and has expanded it to dozens of countries and territories around the world. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to expanding &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; to Puerto Rico today, Apple also launched the Tap to Provision feature in Hong Kong, Macao, and Mongolia. Tap to Provision lets users add eligible credit and debit cards to the Wallet app by tapping the card on the back of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/apple-pay-puerto-rico/">Apple Pay Now Available in Puerto Rico</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-now-available-in-puerto-rico.2453436/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a firmware update for the 25W <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> Charger that is compatible with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 and later and the latest AirPods. The updated firmware is version 2A146, up from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/14/25w-magsafe-charger-firmware-update/">the 2A143 firmware</a> that came out earlier this year. In the Settings app, the new firmware is version 136, up from 133.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965150" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/new-magsafe-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1764" height="992" /><br/>
Apple launched the 2024 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, and it is able to charge them at up to 25W. For the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 models to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, charging is capped at 15W.<br/>
<br/>
Because firmware updates are released quietly over the air, Apple does not provide release notes. We don't know what new features or bug fixes might be included in the software.<br/>
<br/>
There is no clear method for updating a ‌&zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;‌ charger's firmware, but it needs to be plugged in and connected to an Apple device for a firmware update to initiate.

		<title>Apple&#039;s Long-Rumored Foldable iPhone is Starting to Sound Serious</title>

		<description><![CDATA[While it might feel like a foldable iPhone has been two years away for years now, rumors about the device are finally starting to sound serious.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Homescreen.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995585" /><br/>
There are now several sources who agree that Apple's first foldable iPhone will feature a 7.8-inch inner display when unfolded, along with a 5.5-inch outer display. Those sources <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">include analysts Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/">Jeff Pu</a>, along with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/">Weibo account Digital Chat Station</a>. The fact that these display sizes are now agreed upon and have been leaked indicates that Apple may have finalized at least some of the device's specifications.<br/>
<br/>
The foldable iPhone will open up like a book, according to Kuo, rather than have a clamshell design like Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip.<br/>
<br/>
Pu said the foldable iPhone recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) stage at manufacturer Foxconn</a>, suggesting that Apple is moving forward with plans to release the device. Pu and Kuo both believe that the foldable iPhone will enter mass production in the fourth quarter of 2026, which means the device could launch as soon as next year in limited quantities, but a release at some point in 2027 seems more likely.<br/>
<br/>
As funny as it might sound, the foldable iPhone seems to be two years away for real this time.<br/>
<br/>
Barclays analyst Tim Long recently estimated that Apple's first foldable iPhone <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/foldable-iphone-price-estimate/">could start at around &#36;2,299 in the U.S.</a>, meaning it would cost nearly twice as much as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which starts at &#36;1,199 there.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the 7.8-inch inner display and 5.5-inch outer display, Kuo said the foldable iPhone will feature two rear cameras, one front camera, a Touch ID power button instead of Face ID, and a high-density battery. He expects the device to be as thin as 4.5mm when unfolded, and between 9mm and 9.5mm when folded. He also said the device will have a titanium exterior, but the hinge will use a mix of titanium and stainless steel.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/foldable-iphone-rumors-sounding-serious/">Apple&#039;s Long-Rumored Foldable iPhone is Starting to Sound Serious</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-long-rumored-foldable-iphone-is-starting-to-sound-serious.2453431/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two new PebbleOS smartwatches <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches">were announced today</a> by original Pebble watch creator Eric Migicovsky, revitalizing a Kickstarter-launched brand that had three years of mega popularity before it folded in 2016.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/pebble-smartwatches.jpg" alt="" width="2037" height="1146" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995576" /><br/>
Called the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2, the two smartwatches run a PebbleOS, which is based on the source code for the software that ran on the original Pebble smartwatch. After Pebble shut down, assets were acquired by Fitbit, which was then acquired by Google. Google agreed to open source PebbleOS earlier this year, paving the way for the return of Pebble watches.<br/>
<br/>
Like the original Pebble watches, the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 are platform agnostic and designed to work with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Android, but Migicovsky <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones">is already warning customers</a> that Apple's restrictions are going to prevent the new devices from working like the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Migicovsky says that it was difficult to design for iPhones when he was working on the original Pebble watch, and in the last eight years, "things have actually gotten worse." He said that his company will "build a good app for iOS," but that it is impossible for a third-party smartwatch to replicate the functions of the Apple Watch. He shared an extensive list of the limitations:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>There's no option for sending text messages or iMessages.</li><br/>
 	<li>There's no option for replying to notifications or taking actions like marking something as done.</li><br/>
 	<li>There is little inter-app communication, which makes it difficult for Pebble to work with other iOS apps.</li><br/>
 	<li>If the iOS app is closed, the watch can't access the app or the internet.</li><br/>
 	<li>The watch cannot detect if you're using your phone, so it will buzz and display a notification regardless.</li><br/>
 	<li>There's no easy option to allow developers to create watch faces and apps for Pebble that would be available through the Pebble iOS app.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Migicovsky lamented that Pebble is required to go through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, which is a "gigantic pain" because with every update, a "random app reviewer" could "make up some BS excuse" and deny updates. He says that Apple makes it "nearly impossible for 3rd party wearable developers" to create an experience that mirrors the Apple Watch experience.<br/>
<blockquote>Apple claims their restrictions on competitors are only about security, privacy, crafting a better experience etc etc. At least that's what they tell you as they tuck you into bed. I personally don't agree - they're clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem.</blockquote><br/>
According to Migicovsky, the new Pebble watches will have less developed functionality on iOS than Android, which "is Apple's fault." He said that he does not want to see complaints about the lack of functionality, so he is sharing the info now so customers can make an informed decision about whether to buy the product. "If you're worried about this," he wrote, "the easiest solution is to buy an Android phone."<br/>
<br/>
Migicovsky calls on "Pebble-curious" &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to complain loudly to Apple or switch to Android, while also asking elected representatives in the U.S. to support legislation that would require Apple to make changes to its rules. In Europe, Migicovsky plans to petition Apple to request interoperability for Apple Watch APIs.<br/>
<br/>
Migicovsky last clashed with Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android/">over the Beeper Mini app</a>, and he has been outspoken about Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules since then, meeting with the FTC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/22/doj-and-ftc-looking-into-beeper-controversy/">and the U.S. Department of Justice</a>. Beeper Mini reverse engineered iMessage protocols and encryption, using Apple's own iMessage servers to let Android users send "blue bubble" texts to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users without the need for an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/beeper-mini-continued-outages/">blocked the functionality</a>, and Beeper was ultimately forced to give up on the idea.<br/>
<br/>
The Core 2 Duo watch is priced starting at &#36;149, and the Core Time 2 is priced starting at &#36;225, with pre-orders <a href="https://store.repebble.com">available on the Repebble website</a>. Both devices feature an always-on e-paper screen, physical buttons, step and sleep tracking, and a 30 day battery life, with the more expensive model also offering a heart rate monitor. The Core 2 Duo will ship starting in July, while the Core Time 2 will ship starting in December.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pebble/">Pebble</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/pebble-smartwatch-apple-restrictions/">Apple Restricting New Pebble Smartwatches From &#039;Being Awesome&#039; With iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-restricting-new-pebble-smartwatches-from-being-awesome-with-iphone.2453428/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Provides Update on Expanding AirPods Hearing Aid Feature to Canada</title>

		<description><![CDATA[While the AirPods hearing aid and hearing test features received Health Canada approval at the federal level in December, the features are not yet available in Canada. According to reports <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/toronto/consumer-alert/article/i-think-its-sinful-to-hold-it-back-consumers-frustrated-apple-hearing-aid-feature-not-available-in-canada/">from <em>CTV News</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.thestar.com/life/health-wellness/apple-s-airpods-hearing-aid-feature-is-available-in-106-countries-but-not-canada-here/article_76c5641a-0346-11f0-a88b-9fa7e7f24a0b.html"><em>Toronto Star</em></a> this month, the features have yet to launch in Canada because regulations vary at the provincial level.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/airpods-pro-2-hearing-aids.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964676" /><br/>
In the most populous Canadian province of Ontario, for example, hearing aids require a prescription from a physician or an audiologist.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that Apple recently told the <em>Toronto Star</em> that it is working with Canadian provinces to get approval to release the AirPods hearing aid and hearing test features over the counter. Apple told the newspaper that it hopes to make the features available as soon as possible, but it did not provide a timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
With the clinical-grade hearing aid feature, AirPods Pro 2 can amplify the sound around you. The feature is intended for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, according to Apple. There is no additional cost to use the feature.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the five-minute hearing test allows adults to identify if they have hearing loss by measuring their ability to hear different frequencies of sound. Afterwards, the results will show a hearing loss classification and recommended next steps.<br/>
<br/>
The two features first launched in the U.S. and <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/feature-availability/">select other countries</a> in late October, and they continue to roll out to more countries.<br/>
<br/>
There is a third AirPods hearing health feature — hearing protection — that is available in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
All three features require AirPods Pro 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/airpods-hearing-aid-feature-canada-update/">Apple Provides Update on Expanding AirPods Hearing Aid Feature to Canada</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-provides-update-on-expanding-airpods-hearing-aid-feature-to-canada.2453424/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

In a post yesterday, the account said all of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-magsafe-action-button/">iPhone 17 dummy models</a> shared by Sonny Dickson over the weekend are accurate. They said the dummy models align with their own information that they received, including all four iPhone 17 models supporting MagSafe for magnetic wireless charging and magnetic accessories.<br/>
<br/>
"The entire series has MagSafe," the post says, in computer-translated English.<br/>
<br/>
It was not entirely clear if the iPhone 17 Air would support MagSafe given the feature is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-provides-reason-iphone-16e-no-magsafe/">missing on the lower-end iPhone 16e</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/iphone-17-air-magsafe-expected/">Unlike the iPhone 16e, the iPhone 17 Air is Expected to Feature MagSafe</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unlike-the-iphone-16e-the-iphone-17-air-is-expected-to-feature-magsafe.2453421/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
