		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/mr">Ocushield</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and one of <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/screen-protectors-mr">Ocushield's Blue Light Screen Protectors</a> to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ocushield-iphone-screen-protector.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948253" /><br/>
Ocushield has a range of medically rated screen protectors that are designed for for the <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/iphone-mr">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/ipad-mr">iPad</a>, and <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/macbook-mr">MacBook</a>. Ocushield specializes in blue light reduction, so all of its screen protectors cut down on the amount of blue light that you're exposed to when using your devices.<br/>
<br/>
Blue light can cause eye strain, headaches, dry eyes, fatigue, and blurry vision in some people, and it is hard to avoid between work on the computer and day-to-day <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> usage. Blue light can also impact sleep because it affects the production of melatonin and your body doesn't naturally produce enough to tell you when to go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ocushield-ipad-screen-protector-2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948254" /><br/>
Ocushield's <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/iphone-mr">iPhone Screen Protector</a> comes in sizes that fit all devices dating back to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5. It comes with a kit for cleaning the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and an applicator tray for alignment purposes, both of which make for a no-flaw application process.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/ipad-mr">iPad Screen Protector</a> features a similar kit, and it is available for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>. Each one comes with a screen cleaner, tray for application, sticker to remove dust, and a cleaning cloth.<br/>
<br/>
The blue light filters block up to 99 percent of UV and blue light emissions between 300-400nm, and up to 54 percent of harmful blue light between 400 to 470nm. Ocushield says that its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; screen protectors are meant to preserve the natural colors of the device for a clear picture.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ocushield-screen-protector-application.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948255" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Screen Protectors are both made of thin, tempered glass, which also offer screen protection. They come with an anti-bacterial coating, oil resistance, and an anti-reflection coating that cuts down on fingerprints. Ocushield says that the screen protectors are able to prevent eye strain, improve sleep, and protect the eyes and skin from harmful blue light.<br/>
<br/>
While the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Screen Protectors are permanent and attach with no-damage adhesive, Ocushield's <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/macbook-mr">MacBook Anti-Blue Light Filter</a> works a little differently. Apple does not recommend closing a MacBook with a screen protector attached, so the Blue Light Filter for Mac is removable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ocushield-mac-screen-protector.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948256" /><br/>
It adheres using silicone or magnets depending on your Mac model, and it can be put on when you're using your Mac and then taken off when you need to close the display. It offers the same blue light protection as the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Screen Protectors, but it also has a built-in privacy filter. When attached, the display of a Mac viewed from the side is near black, preserving privacy. It also has an anti-bacterial coating and an anti-glare coating that cut down on glare and reflections.<br/>
<br/>
Ocushield <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/eyejust-mr">recently acquired EyeJust</a>, a company that creates blue light blocking glasses, so it is expanding its product lineup with <a href="https://www.ocushield.com/glasses-mr">stylish glasses</a> that will work for all devices, and improving its presence in the United States (it is based in the UK).<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that Apple has added built-in blue light reduction features to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and Mac with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-shift/">Night Shift</a>, but the functionality only works at night. It also has a greater impact on color accuracy because it uses display color temperature for blocking blue light. Ocushield also has a wider feature set, including anti-drop protection for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and side-angle viewing restrictions on the Mac, plus glare reduction across all devices. To celebrate spring, Ocushield has a 15 percent discount on all products right now with the promo code BLOOM2024. <br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1A8a0CfCEqo?si=d8w7_EMZ_cCvTHuH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div> <br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">event invite</a> shows an artistic render of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, suggesting that iPads will be a focus of the event. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-has-six-artistic-logos/">alluded to the Apple Pencil</a> in relation to the event and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-has-six-artistic-logos/">series of promotional Apple logos</a> appear to hint at upcoming illustration capabilities. Apple has not released any new iPads since October 2022, so this event has been a long time coming. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, along with updated &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and Magic Keyboard accessories. Here is everything that has been rumored:<ul><li>Two new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with the M3 chip, OLED displays, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">thinner enclosure</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-models-thinner-bezels-rumor/">slimmer bezels</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/">matte screen option</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, other design changes, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">possibly MagSafe wireless charging</a>.</li><br/>
<li>Two new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, including a first-ever 12.9-inch display option.</li><br/>
<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">aluminum top case</a>, larger trackpad, and other "laptop-like" design improvements.</li><br/>
<li>A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">new Apple Pencil</a>, which may have a new "squeeze" gesture for certain actions and eventual <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-pencil-visionon-support-in-testing/">support for visionOS</a>.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Apple's upcoming special event will take place on Tuesday, May 7 at 7 a.m. Pacific Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time), with a live stream to be available on Apple.com and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1J38FlDKxo">on YouTube</a> as usual. The event invitation does not mention an in-person component, with Apple inviting the media to watch online alongside the general public. It will take place just over a month before Apple's annual developers conference WWDC, which runs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">from June 10 through June 14</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple introduced the third-generation AirPods nearly three years ago and an all new model is now slated to launch later this year with a range of improvements and new features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/AirPods-Fourth-Generation-Feature-Red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905655" /><br/>
Many of the changes and improvements introduced with the third-generation AirPods originated on the first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>. As such, it seems likely that many of the upgrades coming to the fourth-generation AirPods will be shaped by the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. Our best indications so far about what to expect come from a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/airpods-4-new-design/">report by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="two_models">Two Models</h3><br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/airpods-4-new-design/">two versions</a> of the fourth-generation AirPods targeting different price points. The company is apparently aiming to replace both the third-generation AirPods and the lower-priced second-generation AirPods that it continues to sell. Currently, there is little difference between the AirPods 2 and ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>‌ beyond their designs.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end version of the AirPods will purportedly feature Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and a speaker in the charging case that can play a sound for easy location, which both have to date been limited to the ‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design_changes">Design Changes</h3><br/>
The next-generation AirPods are rumored to feature an updated design, looking like a cross between the current AirPods and the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, with slightly shorter stems. Fit is expected to be improved, but it is as of yet unclear if Apple will add silicone ear tips.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="h2_chip">H2 Chip</h3><br/>
One of the key aspects the next-generation AirPods are likely to bring over from the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; is the H2 chip. Both the second- and third-generation AirPods currently feature the H1 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-h2-chip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866128" /><br/>
Apple says the H2 chip provides an "exceptional acoustic experience" when paired with a new low-distortion audio driver and custom amplifier in the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. The ‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌ offer richer bass and clearer sound across a wider range of frequencies partly due to the computational audio improvements facilitated by the H2 chip, so similar enhancements seem highly likely to come to the fourth-generation AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
There could also be improvements to Personalized Spatial Audio, faster pairing and device switching, and persistent battery information thanks to the H2 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="bluetooth_5.3">Bluetooth 5.3</h3><br/>
In the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, the H2 chip is accompanied by Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. Many of Apple's products now feature Bluetooth 5.3, so the fourth-generation AirPods are highly likely to receive this upgrade. Bluetooth 5.3 offers faster and more reliable connectivity with Bluetooth accessories, as well as improved power efficiency, which can contribute to longer battery life. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="longer_battery_life">Longer Battery Life</h3><br/>
The H2 chip is more power efficient than the H1 chip in the second- and third-generation AirPods. In the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, the H2 chip and Bluetooth 5.3 provide an additional hour and a half of listening time with Active Noise Cancellation enabled compared to the previous generation. Applied to the standard AirPods, this could translate to a battery life increase from five hours to around six and a half hours.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="volume_controls">Volume Controls</h3><br/>
It is also possible that the AirPods could gain touch-based volume controls like the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. To turn the volume up or down, users simply place their thumb on the stem of either AirPod and use their index finger to swipe up or down on the small touch control area.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/Apple-AirPods-Pro-2nd-gen-Touch-control-220907.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866685" /><br/>
That being said, Apple could regard on-device volume controls as a high-end feature reserved for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, meaning that the fourth-generation AirPods could still miss out on this feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="find_my_improvements">Find My Improvements</h3><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> Charging Case is also likely to get several improvements to integrate more deeply with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>. The second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; introduced two key features in this area: The U1 chip for Precision Tracking and a built-in speaker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-precision-finding.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866313" /><br/>
Currently, your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> can help guide you to their location in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, but this is a limited experience on the current model, simply indicating whether or not they are nearby. The U1 chip would allow your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to show an arrow pointing in the specific direction of your AirPods, an approximate distance telling you how far away they are, and even a message saying if they are located on a different floor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/AirPods-Pro-2-Charging-Case.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-862696" /><br/>
Similarly, you can currently play a sound on your AirPods to help you find them, but this is played through the earbuds. If the earbuds are inside the charging case, it is likely the sound will be quite muffled. With the latest &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, Apple added a speaker to the charging case itself, allowing users to more clearly hear a location alert from their AirPods, and even locate the case when it is separate from the earbuds. An identical speaker is expected come to the high-end version of the standard AirPods in their next iteration.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that the lanyard loop on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; doubles as an antenna for the U1 chip, so this small feature could also be coming to the next-generation AirPods if they do offer Precision Tracking.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="apple_watch_charger_compatibility">Apple Watch Charger Compatibility</h3><br/>
The third-generation AirPods can charge via &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, a Qi wireless charger, or a Lightning cable. With its latest &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; model, Apple added the ability to use an Apple Watch charger as an additional charging method. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-apple-watch-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1564" height="878" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866129" /><br/>
Apple does not seem to regard charging technologies as "Pro"-exclusive features, so, as a basic utility, it seems likely that this added charging method will come to the fourth-generation AirPods to provide even more versatility. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="hearing_aid_functionality">Hearing Aid Functionality</h3><br/>
In a software update coming later next year, Apple will apparently add hearing aid functionality, allowing AirPods to serve as an over-the-counter (OTC) hearing alternative to traditional hearing aids. The FDA in 2022 approved <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/hearing-aids/otc-hearing-aids-what-you-should-know">OTC hearing aid options</a>, paving the way for Apple to market the AirPods for hearing loss. Apple also allegedly plans to offer hearing tests that would tell AirPods users if they are experiencing hearing loss.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="usb-c_port">USB-C Port</h3><br/>
Like the most recent &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models and the USB-C &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, the fourth-generation AirPods are expected to include a USB-C port for charging.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="release_date">Release Date</h3><br/>
Rumors suggest that the fourth-generation AirPods will launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">in September or October 2024</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4 Rumors: Everything We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-4-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far.2397674/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users know how to share a webpage link in Messages, but not everyone realizes that you can quote text from the webpage and include it in the message link. Keep reading to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/quoted-text-webpage-share-messages-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940595" /><br/>
Incorporating quoted text when sharing a webpage link in Messages is a great way to get to the point and make it clear why the content you're sharing is relevant and interesting. It not only makes the link more engaging but also personalizes the message if it's sent in the midst of a conversation.<br/>
<br/>
By highlighting specific text, you can streamline your communication by directing the recipient's attention to the most pertinent information on the linked website. It saves time, and ensures that the key piece of information you want to share isn't missed. It can also serve as a conversation starter. Here's how it works.<br/>
<ol><li>In Safari, navigate to the webpage containing the relevant information you want to share.</li><br/>
<li>Select the text that you want to quote in your shared link by pressing and holding on the words, using the selection anchors to more precisely include the text you want.</li><br/>
<li>Choose <strong>Copy</strong> from the pop-up menu.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>Share</strong> button at the bottom of Safari's interface, then tap the Messages icon in the share sheet, or choose a contact to message in the suggested list above.</li><br/>
<li>In the Messages app, add a comment for more context if desired, then tap the send button.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Monday-11-Mar-2024-14-45-05.jpg" alt="" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940596" /><br/>
That's all there is to it. By using this method of sharing links, it can even serve as a memory aid in ongoing conversations, which can help both you and your recipient recall the relevance of its content to previous discussions.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple used to regularly increase the base memory of its Macs up until 2011, the same year Tim Cook was appointed CEO, charts posted on Mastodon by David Schaub show.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-feature-purple-green.jpg" alt="" width="2585" height="1454" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898568" /><br/>
Earlier this year, Schaub generated two charts: One showing the <a href="https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111813281624281698">base memory capacities of Apple's all-in-one Macs</a> from 1984 onwards, and a second depicting Apple's <a href="https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111382154184733138">consumer laptop base RAM</a> from 1999 onwards. Both charts were recently resurfaced by the <a href="https://atp.fm/560">Accidental Tech Podcast</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The graphs show that Apple tended to increase the base memory every two years or so, but that this trend ended when Cook took over the company from Steve Jobs. Memory increased quickly until the Mac Plus was launched in 1986, notes Schaub. "1986 to 1990 were all about decreasing the entry Mac price," he says. "Then we get a pretty straight logarithmic line until Tim Cook became CEO and there has only been a single increase since."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/all-in-one-base-ram-chart.jpg" alt="" width="1246" height="984" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948272" /><br/>
The correlation is interesting, but other variables such as market trends and changes in technology can help to account for the plateau in Cook's era. For example, Stuart McHattie <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@sdjmchattie/111813561857963100">notes</a> that early all-in-one Macs saw a tenfold increase every six years. If that trend had continued from 2006 onwards when the base was 500MB, modern base model Macs would have reached 500GB. Yet today's consumer PC demand for RAM remains around 8GB to 64GB, and very rarely exceeds double digits.<br/>
<br/>
Computers have also changed a lot over the last several years. RAM has gotten faster. Hard disk drives have been superseded by solid-state storage. Chips and components are more tightly integrated. Apple no longer relies on Intel processors to power its machines, and instead uses high performance system-on-a-chip (SOC) architecture, which fuses CPUs, GPUs, and unified memory into a single package. This is why the company feels confident in arguing that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">8GB on a Mac is comparable to 16GB on rival systems</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/laptop-base-ram-chart.jpg" alt="" width="1638" height="1208" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948273" /><br/>
But that does not change the fact that Apple has offered iMac and MacBook Pro models with 8GB of RAM since 2012. Likewise, the MacBook Air has had the same base memory configuration since 2017. In addition, Apple's adoption of unified memory means that Macs cannot have their RAM upgraded after purchase, while Apple continues to pursue a strategy of vastly overcharging customers for higher memory configurations. Users often pay out &#36;200 or more at checkout just to future proof their machines. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/is-8gb-of-ram-enough-for-macbook-pro/">Is 8GB of RAM Enough for a Mac in 2024?</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple's Mac memory configuration strategy is likely to become even more contentious if <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">all upcoming iPhone 16 models turn out to include 8GB of RAM</a>. (In the iPhone 15 series, only the Pro models have 8GB, whereas standard models have 6GB.) Why Apple is prepared to increase RAM in a smartphone but not in a multitasking Mac without users paying excessively for the privilege will be the overriding question on many consumers' lips.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/26/apple-mac-base-ram-boosts-ended-tim-cook/">Apple&#039;s Regular Mac Base RAM Boosts Ended When Tim Cook Took Over</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-regular-mac-base-ram-boosts-ended-when-tim-cook-took-over.2424950/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Analytics company Canalys has released its <a href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q1-2024">latest report</a> on China's smartphone market for the first quarter of 2024, and Apple has come off worst among the top five brands jostling for supremacy in Asia's largest economy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-15-china.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943595" /><br/>
Huawei returned to the top spot after 13 quarters with a 17% market share. The local vendor shipped 11.7 million smartphones, thanks to its popular Mate and nova series, while OPPO rose to second place on strong performance of its Reno 11 series, shipping 10.9 million units. Conversely, HONOR, vivo, and Apple all slowed their sell-ins in the quarter, ranking third, fourth, and fifth, respectively. <br/>
<br/>
HONOR shipped 10.6 million units with a 16% share, a year-on-year increase of 9%, while vivo shipped 10.3 million units with a 15% share, a year-on-year decrease of 9%. Apple declined the most among the top five, sinking to fifth from first place, with 10 million units and a 15% share, which is a year-on-year decrease of 25%.<br/>
<br/>
Huawei's performance is up 70% from a year earlier, when the company was still reorganizing its phone business following U.S. sanctions. Huawei's 5G Mate 60 Pro uses a China-made 7-nanometer processor tailored for the local market, showcasing the kind of advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities that US sanctions were originally designed to prevent. <br/>
<br/>
Huawei has since released its new Pure line of flagship smartphones, and has been busy developing its own operating system, HarmonyOS, since it could not use Google's Android and Google Mobile Services. The continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem breaks the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China. <br/>

The latest data is unlikely to make for pleasant reading for Apple's CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/tim-cook-visits-shanghai/">his trip to China</a> for the inauguration of a major new store in Shanghai. During his visit, coming on the back of a strong Chinese fourth quarter, Cook announced the expansion of Apple's R&D center in the city, highlighting China's crucial role in the company's strategy. Cook also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing, where he said the country was "critical" to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is deepening its ties with China despite expanding production in Southeast Asia and India. Approximately 17% of Apple's net sales from October to December were derived from the greater China region, making it the largest regional supplier in the company's supply chain. But Apple is facing an uphill battle to reverse falling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales there, with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/china-iphone-sales-slump-early-2024/">24% year-on-year decline in 2023</a> projected to deepen through 2024. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/huawei/">Huawei</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/canalys/">Canalys</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/26/apple-sinks-fifth-place-china-handset-market/">Apple Sinks From First to Fifth Place in Chinese Smartphone Market</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sinks-from-first-to-fifth-place-in-chinese-smartphone-market.2424942/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> in June 2023, adding an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Ultra chip and officially completing the transition away from Intel chips. The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; uses the same &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip that's in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, leading to criticism about its lack of power.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-Mac-Pro-Feature-Warm-2.jpg" alt="" width="2672" height="1503" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948229" /><br/>
Apple has now gone back to the drawing board and is working on an updated version of the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; that's set to come out next year. This guide highlights everything we know about Apple's &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; progress.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="m4_chip">M4 Chip</h2><br/>
The next &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will have a chip that's in the M4 family, as Apple is working to update its entire Mac lineup to the M4 series across 2024 and 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> believes that Apple wants to establish a more regular Apple silicon chip upgrade cycle that would perhaps see Mac chips refreshed on an annual basis much like chips designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says that the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will be equipped with the highest-end version of the M4 chip, which is codenamed "Hidra." Hidra is likely equivalent to an "Ultra" chip based on the way that Apple has differentiated its chips in the past. The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; is aimed at professional videographers, photographers, designers, and others who need significant processing power, and some pro users are said to have been unhappy with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, Apple is looking to make the M4 &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; more powerful.<br/>
<br/>
All of the M4 chips will be designed with a focus on artificial intelligence, with Apple aiming to highlight the AI processing capabilities of the chips and how they'll integrate into macOS. Apple is adding AI features that will run solely on device to the next operating system updates, so the M4 chips will need to have a lot of compute power.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that the M4 chips will feature an upgraded Neural Engine with more cores to handle AI tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="unified_memory">Unified Memory</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; could support up to 500GB Unified Memory, way up from the current 192GB maximum.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="will_there_be_an_m3_mac_pro">Will there be an M3 Mac Pro?</h3><br/>
It doesn't sound like Apple is going to bother with an M3 Ultra chip for the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;, with the company instead focusing effort on the M4 update.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design_updates">Design Updates</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; saw a major design update in 2019, with Apple doing away with the cylindrical "trash can" look in favor of a more reserved aluminum computer tower. There were no design changes to the 2022 model when it was refreshed, and so far we've heard nothing about design changes to the upcoming M4 variant.<br/>
<br/>
Launch is still more than a year away though, so it's possible Apple will make some design updates, at least internally to support M4 chip changes.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="launch_date">Launch Date</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; is expected to be the last of Apple's Macs to get the M4 chip, and rumors suggest that it will come out in late 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro">Mac Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1">Mac Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-pro/">Apple&#039;s 2025 M4 Mac Pro: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-2025-m4-mac-pro-what-to-expect.2424932/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Review: Satechi Launches New Qi2 Charging Stands</title>

		<category>Satechi</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://satechi.net">Satechi</a> today announced the availability of its two new Qi2 charging stands, the 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand and the 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand. Qi2 is the latest version of the Qi standard, and it is comparable to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/satechi-3-in-1-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929700" /><br/>
Qi2 uses magnets to ensure that smartphones are aligned properly with charging coils, and it is able to charge compatible iPhones at up to 15W. The faster Qi2 charging speeds are available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, and all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models. Future iPhones, such as the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, will also work with Qi2.<br/>
<br/>
While Qi2 is basically the same as &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, it has the benefit of not being controlled by Apple, so Qi2 accessories can be a bit cheaper than &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; technology that manufacturers have to license from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-3-in-1-fold.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948211" /><br/>
Both of the Satechi Wireless Charging Stands have the same design, featuring a square wireless charging pedestal for the AirPods, an arm attached by a hinge, and a round magnetic wireless charger for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The 3-in-1 model adds a fold-out Apple Watch charger to the back of the arm.<br/>
<br/>
These chargers collapse down flat, which makes them convenient to tuck into a bag or backpack, but the aluminum they're made from is on the heavy side. The option to fold them down is a plus, but because of the weight, they may not be a better option than something like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/mophie-3-in-1-travel-charger-magsafe/">Mophie's 3-in-1 travel charger</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The folding design is, however, a major improvement over most chargers, so if you want something that works well both on a desktop and when traveling, Satechi's Qi2 options are worth looking at. Compared to a flat charger, being able to unfold the arm and have an upright charger is useful because it enables features like StandBy on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Night Stand mode on the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
The base of each charger has a soft-touch vegan leather material and a little divot where the AirPods are meant to go. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charging puck also has a soft-touch silicone to ensure that it doesn't scratch the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and the Apple Watch charger is made from a standard white plastic.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-3-in-1-design.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948212" /><br/>
With the aluminum build, the chargers look like quality products, and they'll match well with most desk setups. It is worth noting that Satechi is only selling these in space gray, so if you prefer silver aluminum or shades of white, that's not an option.<br/>
<br/>
The best part about Satechi's Charging Stands is the Qi2 charging puck. It's attached to the arm of the device using a hinge, so the charger can be set to several different angles. It can be positioned straight up so it's essentially a flat charging surface, or tilted down all the way to take up minimal space. In between, there are angles ideal for watching videos or FaceTiming. As with most upright magnetic chargers, the Charging Stands can be used with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; positioned in landscape or portrait orientation. Satechi says that the hinges on the stand won't weaken over time, and they do seem firm while still being easy to manipulate.<br/>
<br/>
In testing, Satechi's Qi2 Charging Stands worked like &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging stands. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is able to attach magnetically, and charging speeds were about the same as &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; did get a little warm a few times, but that also happens with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; chargers. Over a 30-minute period, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max was able to charge from 22 percent to 52 percent, for a 30 percent total charge.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-2-in-1-folded.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948216" /><br/>
The AirPods charging spot charges the AirPods at 5W, and the 3-in-1 version's Apple Watch charger is a fast charger so it can charge the Apple Watch Series 7 and later and the Ultra models at the quickest speed. There is a small light at the front of the charger when it is in use, but it is not overly bright.<br/>
<br/>
For powering the Charging Stands, there's a USB-C port at the back, which is nice because the cable can be swapped out if it becomes damaged or if you need a cable of a different length. The more expensive 3-in-1 charger includes a 45W power adapter and interchangeable plugs for international travel, and both models come with a plain black USB-C cable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-2-in-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948213" /><br/>
One of the benefits of Qi2 is lower prices, but Satechi's Wireless Charging Stands are still expensive. The 3-in-1 model is priced at &#36;130, likely because Satechi is still licensing Apple Watch charging technology from Apple, while the 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand is &#36;80. For the build quality and the versatility afforded by the hinged design, the pricing does not seem unfair, and Satechi's 3-in-1 is &#36;20 cheaper than MagSafe-based 3-in-1 charging options sold by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand is priced at &#36;130, while the 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand is priced at &#36;80. Both products can be <a href="https://satechi.net">purchased from the Satechi website</a> as of today.<br/>

Whether you are the owner of a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or a longtime user looking to up your photography game, here are six camera tools and settings in iOS that are worth checking out and experimenting with.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="1._use_the_rule_of_thirds">1. Use the Rule of Thirds</h2><br/>
For a while now, Apple's Camera app has included a few optional settings that can help you line up your shots. Foremost in these settings is the Grid tool, which should be used when applying the rule of thirds. It divides the frame of your photo into a grid with two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, creating nine equal parts. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/grid-camera-tool.jpg" alt="" width="2716" height="1339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927774" /><br/>
The rule of thirds helps guide the viewer's eye to the most important parts of your photo and creates a more harmonious composition. Here's how to overlay a grid on the viewfinder.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap Camera. </li><br/>
<li>In the "Composition" section, toggle on the switch next to Grid.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/camera-grid-setting.jpg" alt="settings" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927655" /><br/>
<br/>
Here are five things to keep in mind when using the grid to apple the rule of thirds.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Identify the Key Elements</strong>: First, identify the main subjects or elements in the scene you want to photograph. These could be a person, a building, a tree, or any focal point.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Positioning the Subjects</strong>: Place these key elements along the lines or at the points where the lines intersect. For instance, if you're taking a photo of a person, you might position them along one of the vertical lines, rather than in the center of the frame.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Horizontal Elements</strong>: For horizontal elements like the horizon in a landscape, align them with one of the horizontal lines. For a more dramatic sky, place the horizon on the lower line. For more emphasis on the land or sea, place it on the upper line.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Balancing the Image</strong>: Use the rule of thirds to balance your photo. If you place a subject on the left, consider having something of lesser importance on the right to create a sense of balance.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Experimentation</strong>: While the rule of thirds is a guideline, it's not a strict rule. Feel free to experiment with it and see how shifting elements in your frame changes the photo's impact.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2._straighten_top-down_shots">2. Straighten Top-Down Shots</h2><br/>
If you're taking a picture of something from above like a plate of food or an ornament on the ground, consider using the camera level, as it helps you capture a balanced shot without having to use a tripod arm or mount. It's also useful for taking a shot of something directly above you, like an object on the ceiling or in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/level-camera-tool-setting.jpg" alt="" width="1338" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927776" /><br/>
The camera level tool used to be part of the Grid overlay, but Apple separated out the function in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, and it now has its own switch: Open the Settings app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, select Camera, then toggle on the switch next to Level. Now you are ready to use it.<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Open the Camera app, and set the capture mode to <strong>Photo</strong>, <strong>Portrait</strong>, <strong>Square</strong>, or <strong>Time Lapse</strong>, using the sliding menu above the shutter button.</li><br/>
<li>Point the camera straight down above your subject (or straight up if the subject/scene you want to capture is above you).</li><br/>
<li>Line up the floating crosshair with the fixed crosshair in the center of the screen by adjusting the angle of your phone's camera. The crosshairs will both glow yellow when in perfect alignment. </li><br/>
<li>Tap the shutter button to capture the shot.</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/camera-level-tool-in-action.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1058" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927779" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The aligned crosshairs turn yellow (right), indicating the lens is parallel with the ground.</em></div><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="3._straighten_your_horizontal_shots">3. Straighten Your Horizontal Shots</h2><br/>
By making the Level tool an individual option in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Apple has also included an additional horizontal level for more traditional straight-on photos.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-camera-level-no.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899126" /><br/>
Turning the Level option on makes a broken horizontal line appear on the screen when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; senses that you're lining up for a straight-on shot and you tilt your device slightly out of horizontal. The line appears white while your phone is out of level and then turns yellow once you achieve a level orientation to indicate success.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-camera-level.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899127" /><br/>
With the Level setting enabled (Settings ➝ Camera ➝ Level), try it for yourself. Open the Camera app and try shooting a subject at a straight angle, and you should see the broken horizontal lines in the center of the viewfinder. Straighten your angle up to connect the lines and make a single yellow line.<br/>
<br/>
The leveling pop-up only appears briefly and only within a narrow range of angles close to horizontal (in either portrait or landscape orientation), so it won't intrusively pop up when you're intentionally trying to take a photo at an angle.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="4._take_burst_photos">4. Take Burst Photos</h2><br/>
Burst Mode refers to when the camera on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; captures a series of photos in rapid succession, at a rate of ten frames per second. It's a great way to shoot an action scene or an unexpected event, since you're always more likely to end up with the picture you were aiming for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/burstmode.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="460" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-386450" /><br/>
To shoot in Burst Mode, go to Settings ➝ Camera and toggle on <strong>Use Volume Up for Burst</strong>, then simply long press on the Volume Up button when in the Camera app, and your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will take a series of photos in quick succession. Notice that a counter increases inside the on-screen shutter button for as long as you hold down the volume button. This indicates how many shots are being captured in the current burst. Simply take your finger off the volume when you want to end the burst of shots.<br/>
<br/>
When you take a series of burst photos, they automatically appear in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app under the Album name Bursts. You'll also find them in your main Photo Library. Follow the link to learn <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/delete-redundant-burst-mode-photos-iphone-ipad/">how to view and select the best of your Burst photos</a> in the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="5._mirror_your_selfies">5. Mirror Your Selfies</h2><br/>
When you take a selfie with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; using the Camera app, it automatically flips – or mirrors – the image so that it's an inverted version of the mirror image you see in the preview before you take the shot.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/stop-flipped-selfie-iphone-ipad.jpg" alt="selfie" width="2710" height="2616" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757877" /><br/>
This can look odd, since it makes a big difference to how selfies look. It can also be annoying, since most third-party social media apps automatically take mirrored selfies, which means you're more likely to be used to the mirroring functionality than the flipped selfies that your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ takes.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, you can change this default behavior of the Camera app, meaning that you can get the mirrored selfie you're probably more accustomed to seeing. Here's how.<br/>
<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app, then scroll down and select <strong>Camera</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle the switch next to <strong>Mirror Front Camera</strong> to the green ON position.</li></ol><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/mirror-front-camera-setting.jpg" alt="settings" width="1338" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927784" /><br/>
That's all there is to it. From now on when you use the Camera app to shoot a selfie, you'll capture the same shot that you saw in the app's preview mode.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="6._view_outside_the_frame">6. View Outside the Frame</h2><br/>
On &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 and later models, there is an optional camera setting that allows you to see what is outside the bounds of your photo's frame, so you can correct the alignment of photos (and videos) without having to resort to cropping.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/capture-shot-outside-frame-iphone-11-camera-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927787" /><br/>
With the "View Outside the Frame" setting enabled, when shooting using the wide lens or the telephoto lens, the camera will simultaneously shoot using the next widest sensor. So the wide lens is active when you shoot with the telephoto lens, and the ultra-wide is active when you shoot with the wide. <br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap Camera.</li><br/>
<li>Under the "Composition" section, toggle on the switch next to View Outside the Frame.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/view-outside-frame-setting.jpg" alt="settings" width="1338" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927786" /><br/>
<br/>
You may have to play around with zoom levels to switch between lenses, but you'll know the feature is active when the camera interface turns semi-transparent to reveal the surroundings outside of the viewfinder.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photography/">Photography</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/camera-tips-every-iphone-user-should-know/">6 iPhone Camera Tips Every User Should Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/6-iphone-camera-tips-every-user-should-know.2424903/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://twitter.com/quinneverett/status/1783365286961332734">sent an email</a> to some iPhone Upgrade Program members to inform them that their previously-completed iPhone trade-in has been "canceled," but the email was almost certainly sent in error based on the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iPhone-Trade-In-Box.jpg" alt="" width="1472" height="828" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902097" /><br/>
Apple told customers it never received their iPhone, even though they sent it in months ago. In many cases, the customers physically handed their iPhones to an Apple Store employee in person, so there is no possible way they could be at fault. <br/>
<br/>
"Because you didn't trade in your iPhone, we are unable to complete the trade-in process," the email says, according to a screenshot shared with us by reader Quinn Everett. "The associated loan on this iPhone will resume."<br/>
<br/>
Everett and others said the Apple Store app also shows their iPhone's trade-in status has changed to "canceled," suggesting that Apple's email is legitimate. The email has been widely shared across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/weird-iphone-upgrade-program-email-questions.2424868/">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/1ccjcsk/your_tradein_has_been_canceled_the_associated/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/helloandrewc/status/1783352173675315592">X</a>, with many customers receiving it in the early hours of Thursday morning in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Many customers who received the email completed their iPhone trade-in last September, when the iPhone 15 series launched, so the delayed timing of the email suggests that it was sent as a result of a system glitch. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but we will update this story if we receive an explanation.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple chipmaker TSMC has <a href="https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3136">announced</a> plans to produce highly advanced 1.6nm chips that could be destined for future generations of Apple silicon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-silicon-1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1422" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924673" /><br/>
TSMC yesterday unveiled a series of technologies, including the "A16" process, which is a 1.6nm node. The new technology significantly enhances chip logic density and performance, promising substantial improvements for high-performance computing (HPC) products and data centers. <br/>
<br/>
Historically, Apple is among the first companies to adopt new, state-of-the-art chip fabrication technologies. For example, it was the first company to utilize TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> node with the A17 Pro chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, and Apple is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker's upcoming nodes. Apple's most advanced chip designs have historically appeared in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> before making their way to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac lineups, and ultimately trickling down to the Apple Watch and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The A16 technology, which TSMC plans to begin producing in 2026, incorporates innovative nanosheet transistors along with a novel backside power rail solution. This development is expected to provide an 8-10% increase in speed and a 15-20% reduction in power consumption at the same speeds compared to TSMC's N2P process, alongside up to a 1.10x chip density improvement.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC also announced the rollout of its System-on-Wafer (SoW) technology, which integrates multiple dies on a single wafer to boost computing power while occupying less space—a development that could be transformative for Apple's data center operations. TSMC's first SoW offering, which is already in production, is based on Integrated Fan-Out (InFO) technology. A more advanced chip-on-wafer version leveraging CoWoS technology is slated for readiness in 2027.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/next-gen-chip-tech-for-apple-silicon-on-schedule/">making progress</a> toward manufacturing 2nm and 1.4nm chips that are likely destined for future generations of Apple silicon. Its 2nm "N2" node is scheduled for trial production in the second half of 2024 and mass production in late 2025, to be followed by an enhanced "N2P" process in late 2026. Trial production of the 2nm node will begin in the second half of 2024, with small-scale production ramping up in the second quarter of 2025. In 2027, facilities in Taiwan will start to shift toward production of "A14" 1.4nm chips.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's upcoming A18 chips for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup are expected to be based on N3E, while the "A19" for the 2025 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models is expected to be Apple's first 2nm chip. The subsequent year, Apple will likely move to an enhanced version of this 2nm node, followed by the newly announced 1.6nm process.<br/>
<br/>
Each successive TSMC node surpasses its predecessor in terms of transistor density, performance, and efficiency. Late last year, it emerged that TSMC had already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology/">demonstrated prototype 2nm chips to Apple</a> ahead of their expected introduction in 2025.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/25/tsmc-unveils-1-6nm-process/">Apple Partner TSMC Unveils Advanced 1.6nm Process for 2026 Chips</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-partner-tsmc-unveils-advanced-1-6nm-process-for-2026-chips.2424895/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[New iPhone activations are down to a low not seen in the U.S. smartphone market for the last six years, according to a new <a href="https://cirpamazon.substack.com">Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) report</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iphone-15-sizes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912524" /><br/>
While CIRP notes that Apple's installed smartphone base is higher than recorded activations, the figures show its share of new iPhone activations fell from 40% to 33% over the past year, suggesting a shift away from the higher market shares Apple enjoyed in previous years. <br/>
<br/>
Historically, around the time when competitors like Blackberry and Windows phones were more prevalent, iPhone's activation share hovered around one-third. This increased steadily until the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic when various factors contributed to a spike in activations. However, Apple's iPhone share appears to have reverted to its long-term average, with two out of three new smartphone activations now from Android devices.<br/>
<br/>
CIRP suggests the decline is due to the increased price of modern smartphones as well as better durability. While innovation has slowed, there has been a shift from two-year subsidized purchases to more transparent buying plans, which has prompted consumers to hold onto their devices for longer. This trend appears to impact iPhone sales more significantly than those of Android devices, suggesting Apple may need to adjust its strategy to regain market momentum.<br/>
<br/>

The report covers a 12-month period ending each quarter and includes data from CIRP's quarterly survey of mobile phone customers. The aim of this approach is to remove the seasonal spikes typically associated with new device launches and holiday sales, providing a clearer view of ongoing trends, according to the firm.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/">CIRP</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/25/iphone-activation-market-share-decline/">Android Bosses iPhone in Smartphone Activation Market Share</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/android-bosses-iphone-in-smartphone-activation-market-share.2424891/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most of us stare at our iPhones for far too long, and this constant exposure to a bright screen can strain our eyes, especially in low-light conditions or during the twilight hours. That's where the ability to dim your iPhone screen beyond the standard brightness settings becomes a game-changer. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iphone-in-bed.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948101" /><br/>
If the screen of your iPhone or iPad is too bright for comfort, the usual solution is to go to Settings ➝ Display & Brightness and drag the Brightness slider to the left, or open Control Center and adjust the corresponding setting from there. However, if the lowest setting offered by the Brightness level just isn't dim enough for you, there's another way to make your screen even darker. <br/>
<br/>
This feature is particularly useful if you find yourself needing to use your device in dark environments, such as in a bedroom where a partner is sleeping, or in a dimly lit theater. It's also a boon for anyone with light sensitivity, providing a more comfortable viewing experience that minimizes eye strain and fatigue. Let's look at how to set it up below.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Reduce White Point</h2><br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open Settings on your iPhone.</li><br/>
  <li>Select <strong>Accessibility</strong> from the list of options.</li><br/>
  <li>Scroll down and select <strong>Accessibility Shortcut</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Reduce White Point</strong>, then drag it up near the top of the list using the three lines icon.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/reduce-white-point-setup.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942525" /><br/>
<br/>
Now that's set up, simply triple-click your iPhone's <strong>Side button</strong> to display the Accessibility Shortcut menu, then tap <strong>Reduce White Point</strong>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/reduce-white-point.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942527" /><br/>
Your iPhone display will now be dimmer than the dimmest setting offered by the standard Brightness level.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Reset White Point</h2><br/>
To return the white point to its normal level, simply triple-click the <strong>Side button</strong> again and tap <strong>Reduce White Point</strong> to uncheck it. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Adjust White Point</h2><br/>
If the White Point is still too bright (or too dim), you can adjust it manually: In Settings, go to <strong>Accessibility ➝ Display & Text Size</strong>, then scroll down and turn on the switch next to <strong>Reduce White Point</strong>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/adjust-white-point.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942529" /><br/>
This will reveal a slider that you can move left or right to change the brightness level.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Trigger Reduced White Point at Bedtime</h2><br/>
It's possible to make the Reduced White Point setting come on when Bedtime starts, or when your Sleep focus is enabled. This offers an automated approach to minimizing screen brightness, which is particularly beneficial for winding down before bedtime. <br/>
<br/>
Blue light is known for its potential to disrupt natural sleep patterns by inhibiting the production of melatonin, a hormone crucial for sleep regulation. That makes an automation especially useful if you have a habit of reading or browsing on your iPhone as part of your nighttime routine, allowing you to do so without significantly impacting your sleep quality. Here's how it's done.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open the Shortcuts app, then tap the <strong>+</strong> icon in the top-right corner of the screen.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Add Action</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/add-action-shortcuts.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942532" /><br/>
  <li>Type "White Point" in the search field, then choose <strong>Set White Point</strong> when it appears below.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap the blue "Turn" text, then choose <strong>Toggle</strong> from the dropdown menu.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top-right corner of the screen.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/toggle-white-point-shortcut.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942533" /><br/>
</ol>After following the above steps, you should see your new "Set White Point" shortcut in the Shortcuts menu. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/set-white-point-shortcut-gallery.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942541" /><br/>
The Shortcut is now ready to use in a new custom automation. It's easy to make, just follow these steps.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>In the Shortcuts app, select the <strong>Automation</strong> tab, then tap the <strong>+</strong> icon in the top-right corner of the screen.</li><br/>
  <li>Under "Personal Automation," choose <strong>Sleep</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/white-point-bedtime1.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942534" /><br/>
  <li>On the "When" screen, choose <strong>Bedtime Begins</strong> and <strong>Run Immediately</strong>, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>On the "When Bedtime Starts" screen, choose your custom <strong>Set White Point</strong> shortcut.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/white-point-bedtime2.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942535" /><br/>
</ol>You're all done. In the future, when Bedtime starts or when you enable the Sleep focus, your screen's white point will be automatically reduced. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Trigger White Point When Bedtime Ends</h2><br/>
To make sure the white point on your iPhone's display is reset when bedtime ends in the morning, you just have to create an additional automation. This basically involves the same steps you just used to create the first custom automation, except instead of choosing Bedtime Begins in step 3, select <strong>Waking Up</strong>. Here are those steps again for your convenience, but with a modified step 3.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>In the Shortcuts app, select the <strong>Automation</strong> tab, then tap the <strong>+</strong> icon in the top-right corner of the screen.</li><br/>
  <li>Under "Personal Automation," choose <strong>Sleep</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>On the "When" screen, choose <strong>Waking Up</strong> and <strong>Run Immediately</strong>, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>On the "When Bedtime Starts" screen, choose your custom <strong>Set White Point</strong> shortcut.</li><br/>
</ol>That's it! The white point on your iPhone display will now return to normal when your bedtime ends.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shortcuts/">Shortcuts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/make-iphone-display-dimmer-white-point/">How to Make Your iPhone Screen Less Bright in Bed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-make-your-iphone-screen-less-bright-in-bed.2424882/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Threads is testing an option that allows users to archive old posts so that they don't appear on their profile, according to Instagram head Adam Mosseri. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/instagram-threads-app.jpg" alt="" width="1079" height="607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902359" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C6Jq-r-xVpM">post</a> on the Meta-owned social media platform, Mosseri said that the archive option being tested with a small number of people included a manual setting for individual posts, as well as the ability  to automatically archive all posts after a certain period of time. <br/>
<br/>
Users also have the option to unarchive a post to make it public again. If beta testing goes well, the ability to archive posts is likely to be rolled out globally as an option rather than a default behavior, which Mosseri said was the overwhelming preference based on user feedback.<br/>
<br/>
When it launched back in July, Threads was very barebones, with Meta working to add new functionality on a regular basis to bring the network in line with X (Twitter). It has since gained a web app, an ability to search for posts, and a post editing feature. Just last week, Threads began rolling out an option to some users to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C5yvw9LP4j8">filter search results</a> by the most recent posts, rather than just posts suggested by its algorithm. <br/>
<br/>
The slow trickle of new features appears to be gradually paying off: The app now has more than 150 million monthly users, according to Mark Zuckerberg, who revealed the figures on Wednesday during Meta's <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q1/META-Q1-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">first-quarter earnings call</a>. <br/>

The number indicates an increase of about 20 million new users since February, suggesting steady growth, albeit at a slower rate than its initial rapid popularity, when the app racked up 100 million users in its first week. Zuckerberg said in October he believes Threads has a good chance of becoming Meta's next billion-user app.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/">Threads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/25/threads-tests-archive-option-150m-users/">Threads Tests Option to Archive Posts as Platform Hits 150M+ Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-tests-option-to-archive-posts-as-platform-hits-150m-users.2424881/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 193 includes fixes and updates for Accessibility, CSS, Forms, JavaScript, Rendering, Web API, and Web Inspector.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp <a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1783169135221846430">today announced</a> that it is rolling out support for passkeys on iOS, a feature that will let WhatsApp users log in to their accounts on iOS devices using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, or their device passcode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
Passkeys serve as a replacement for a traditional password, and because device authentication is required, passkeys put a stop to online attacks like phishing. With a passkey, there's no password to steal, and no one-time SMS or authentication code that can be intercepted.<br/>
<br/>
Passkeys are also more convenient, because logins are done with a quick &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; scan rather than a password. WhatsApp passkeys can be enabled by opening up the app settings, choosing the Account section, and tapping on "Passkeys."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has supported passkeys since 2022, and they work on devices that run iOS 16 and later, iPadOS 16 and later, and macOS Ventura and later. Many companies have been implementing support for passkeys, including X (formerly Twitter), Google, TikTok, PayPal, Best Buy, Microsoft, PlayStation, and eBay.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/whatsapp-ios-passkey-support/">WhatsApp for iOS Gains Support for Passkeys</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-for-ios-gains-support-for-passkeys.2424850/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
