		<description><![CDATA[Back in 2018, Apple held talks with DuckDuckGo to replace Google as the default search engine in private browsing mode, but ultimately rejected the idea, according to transcripts unsealed by the judge overseeing the US government's antitrust trial against Google in Washington.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/duckduckgo.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="773" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-745060" /><br/>
Testifying in closed sessions, DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg said that his company had about 20 meetings and phone calls with Apple executives, including the head of Safari, in 2018 and 2019 about becoming the default search engine for private browsing mode. <br/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-04/apple-considered-switch-to-search-engine-duckduckgo-from-google?srnd=technology-vp">Bloomberg</a></em>, Apple did not move forward with the deal because John Giannandrea, who joined Apple as head of search in 2018, assumed that since DuckDuckGo relies on Bing for its search information, it also likely provides Microsoft some user information. <br/>
<br/>
That led Giannandrea to believe that DuckDuckGo's privacy marketing is "somewhat incongruent with the details." In a February 2019 email to other Apple executives, Giannandrea said it was therefore "probably a bad idea" to switch to DuckDuckGo for private browsing in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple seriously wanted to switch to DuckDuckGo, "I would probably insist on doing a lot more due diligence with DuckDuckGo," he said. <br/>
<br/>
The trial is between the U.S. Department of Justice and Google, with the DoJ pointing toward Google's dominance on Apple devices as evidence that Google has a search engine monopoly. A multi-billion dollar deal between Apple and Google sees that Google is set as the default search engine on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Last week the trial revealed that Microsoft considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/">selling</a> its Bing search engine to Apple. Had the acquisition happened, Bing would have replaced Google as the default search engine on Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's services chief ‌Eddy Cue‌ also had to testify, and he <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/">explained</a> why Google is the ‌iPhone‌'s default search engine. "We make Google be the default search engine because we've always thought it was the best," Cue said. He went on to say that Apple has not gone with another search engine provider because there is no "valid alternative."<br/>

While Google is the default search engine on Apple devices, users can choose to swap to Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Ecosia as an alternative. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/">Apple Privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duckduckgo/">DuckDuckGo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-considered-duckduckgo-default-private-search/">Apple Considered Making DuckDuckGo Default Search Engine in Safari Private Browsing Mode</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-considered-making-duckduckgo-default-search-engine-in-safari-private-browsing-mode.2406400/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.aspx">announced</a> that it will report its earnings results for the fourth quarter of the 2023 fiscal year on Thursday, November 2. The report will be available at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time on that day, and Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the results on a conference call with analysts at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
A live audio stream of the call will be available on Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">Investor Relations page</a>, and a recording will be available later in the day for replay.<br/>
<br/>
The quarter ran from July 2 through September 30. During this period, Apple's key product launches included the iPhone 15 lineup, Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and updated AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not provided formal guidance since early 2020, but analysts expect the company to report quarterly revenue of around &#36;89.2 billion on average, according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis?p=AAPL">Yahoo Finance</a>. Apple reported &#36;90.1 billion revenue in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Maestri provided the following commentary on Apple's earnings call last quarter:<blockquote>We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.</blockquote>AAPL closed at &#36;173.66 today, down from a 52-week high of &#36;198.23.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-q4-2023-earnings-results-date/">Apple to Report Earnings on November 2 Following iPhone 15 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-report-earnings-on-november-2-following-iphone-15-launch.2406383/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">release of iOS 17.0.3</a> earlier today, Apple has <a href="https://twitter.com/iSpeedtestOS/status/1709731118893666762">stopped signing iOS 16.6.1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/iSpeedtestOS/status/1709731196417016280">iOS 17</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/iSpeedtestOS/status/1709731196417016280">iOS 17.0.1</a>, preventing iPhone users from downgrading to any of those software versions. Apple continues to sign iOS 17.0.2 for now.<br/>
<br/>

Notably, this means that it is no longer possible to downgrade an iPhone from iOS 17 to iOS 16. It is not possible to downgrade to iOS 16.7.<br/>
<br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older iOS releases over time in order to prevent users from downgrading to previous software versions.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 is expected to be released later this month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238">iOS 16</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-stops-signing-ios-16-6-1-through-17-0-1/">Downgrading an iPhone From iOS 17 to iOS 16 is No Longer Possible</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/downgrading-an-iphone-from-ios-17-to-ios-16-is-no-longer-possible.2406380/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The software update also includes other important bug fixes and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213961">security updates</a>, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>

In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213892">support document</a>, Apple revealed that iOS 17.0.3 includes several enterprise-related bug fixes. The update resolves an issue where devices managed via Apple Business Essentials are unable to complete setup after updating to iOS 17, and it fixes bugs related to managed Wi-Fi networks and Microsoft Exchange event invitations.<br/>
<br/>
From the support document:<blockquote><strong>iOS 17.0.3</strong><br/>
<br/>
- Resolves an issue where Apple Business Essentials users were unable to complete setup after updating to iOS 17.<br/>
- iOS 17 devices no longer become unresponsive when joining a managed Wi-Fi network.<br/>
- The Calendar app will no longer resend invitations to all participants after accepting or declining an Exchange event invitation.</blockquote>The device enrollment issue with Apple Business Essentials had been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/16muwkz/apple_business_essentials_ipad_stuck_on/">mentioned on Reddit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.0.3 is available for the iPhone XS and newer. The update can be installed in the Settings app under General → Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
The same enterprise-related bug fixes are also included in iPadOS 17.0.3.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 180 includes fixes and updates for Accessibility, CSS, JavaScript, Loading, Media, Web Animations, and Web API.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-180/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 180 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-180-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2406351/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is currently testing iOS 17.1, the first major update to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> operating system that came out in September. Apple plans to release iOS 17.1 later in October, so we still have several betas to go before the software sees a public debut.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.1-Feature-Fall.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915265" /><br/>
In this guide, we've rounded up all of the feature additions and changes in the iOS 17.1 beta, and we'll be updating it throughout the testing period.<br/>
<h2 id="apple_music_favorites">Apple Music Favorites</h2><br/>
You can favorite songs, albums, playlists, and artists in the iOS 17.1 Music app. Favorited music is added to the Library and improves recommendations. Favoriting replaces the prior "Love" system and favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen's Now Playing widget.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914260" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-music-favorite.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="822" /><br/>
A star next to a track in an album means that it's a favorite, while a dot is next to the most played track. With the favorites system, the Music app is suggesting songs to add to playlists.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914261" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-music-song-suggestions.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="1229" /><br/>
Eventually, Apple plans to provide a Favorite Songs playlist and offer collaborative playlists, but these features do not appear to be implemented as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_music_playlists">Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 provides color-matched playlist artwork options that can be selected as a new customization option for your playlists. There are eight artwork styles that feature geometric shapes and gradients, with the colors featured pulled from the album artwork of the first song in the playlist.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914404" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17-Playlist-Artwork-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
<h2 id="airdrop_over_internet">AirDrop Over Internet</h2><br/>
AirDrop transfers can now be completed over a cellular connection or Wi-Fi if you walk out of the range of the person you're sharing with. That means you will not have to stay close to someone if you are transferring a large number of files.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914263" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ios-17-1-airdrop.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="1796" /><br/>
There is a new "Out of Range" toggle in the AirDrop section of the Settings menu that you can toggle to allow or disallow transfers over cellular.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="play_favorite_songs_quick_action">Play Favorite Songs Quick Action</h2><br/>
If you long press on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> icon on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, you can now choose a "Play Favorite Songs" option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="double_tap_on_apple_watch">Double Tap on Apple Watch</h2><br/>
Double Tap is enabled in the watchOS 10.1 update that is also in beta testing, and the settings for it can be managed using the Apple Watch app.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915258" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/watchos-10-1-double-tap.jpg" alt="" width="2901" height="1632" /><br/>
<br/>
Double Tap allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> owners to tap their thumb and index fingers together to control the Apple Watch with one hand. The gesture can be used for opening up the Smart Stack, answering/ending calls, playing/pausing music, stopping alarms and timers, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="standby_display_options">StandBy Display Options</h2><br/>
Apple added a new "Display" section to the StandBy section of the Settings app, which houses some new customization options. The display can be set to turn off automatically, after 20 seconds, or never.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915259" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/standby-display-settings-ios-17-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
The existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/">Night Mode</a> function that adds a red tint and dims the screen has been relocated to this section, as has the Motion to Wake toggle. The Display section also replaces the prior Always On toggle that limited the display to turning off intelligently.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="uk_bank_balances_in_the_wallet_app">UK Bank Balances in the Wallet App</h2><br/>
UK users can <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2405112/post-32568420">add their UK bank accounts</a> to the Wallet app in iOS 17.1, allowing them to see their account balances, payments, purchases, and deposits.<br/>

<h2 id="books_app">Books App</h2><br/>
The "Reading Now" section in the Apple Books app has been renamed to "Read Now."<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="dynamic_island_flashlight_indicator">Dynamic Island Flashlight Indicator</h2><br/>
When the flashlight is activated on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, or &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, there is now a flashlight icon in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> that lets you know that It is on. The flashlight icon for the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; was previously limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="controller_support">Controller Support</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1707161935358157268?s=20">includes support</a> for the Nintendo Switch N64 Controller.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="extend_wallpaper">Extend Wallpaper</h2><br/>
When you are setting up a new wallpaper, Apple has added an "Extend" option that can be used if the image does not fit the display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="photo_shuffle">Photo Shuffle</h2><br/>
When you add a Photo Shuffle Lock Screen in iOS 17.1, you can select a specific album of photos that will be shown on the Lock Screen rather than having to rely on Apple's pre-selected options like People, Pets, or Nature.<br/>
<br/>
When selecting any of the main Photo Shuffle images, you're brought into a customization screen where you can choose your Favorites album or opt for any other album you have created, giving you complete control over the images that show up on the Lock Screen. There was previously a tool for manually selecting photos, but being able to choose an entire album is quicker.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915205" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ios-17-1-photo-shuffle.jpg" alt="" width="2595" height="2796" /><br/>
Photo Shuffle frequency remains the same at on tap, on lock, hourly, or daily.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="reachability">Reachability</h2><br/>
On iPhones with a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, you'll now see a black background when you use the Reachability feature. In prior versions of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, a blurred version of the device's wallpaper was shown. The change to a black background prevents the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; from being displayed twice when Reachability is used.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915195" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-1-reachability.jpg" alt="" width="1363" height="767" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="journal_app">Journal App</h2><br/>
There is no sign of the promised Journal app in iOS 17.1, but there are mentions of Journaling Suggestions in the code, which indicates that it could be coming before too long.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="80_charging_limit_fix">80% Charging Limit Fix</h2><br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, Apple added a toggle that prevents the devices from charging past 80 percent in order to keep the battery healthy for a longer period of time. In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> could ignore this setting and charge past 80 percent, but that no longer happens following the second beta update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915260" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-1-80-percent-charge.jpg" alt="" width="2166" height="1218" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Award-winning iPhone camera app <a href="http://halide.cam/download">Halide</a> was today updated for iPhone 15 Pro models, and features a set of in-app triggers that work with the devices' new Action button. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/halide-action-button.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915427" /><br/>
With the Halide 2.13 app open on an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Action button can be pressed to trigger manual focus, auto/manual exposure, RAW capture, 12/48-megapixel capture, cycle through lenses, take a picture, and more.<br/>
<br/>
To achieve the feat, Halide developers built a custom Shortcut that when selected in iOS Settings ➝ Action Button, automatically triggers a pre-set option in the app's dedicated new Action button menu when the app is active. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-how-to-customize-action-button/">iPhone 15 Pro: How to Customize the Action Button</a></li></ul><br/>
During setup, Halide's Action button menu explains to users how to set up custom triggers. Alternatively, users can set the Action button to enable a single-click "Open Halide" shortcut or open a Shortcut Menu with a list of options. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, Halide includes new optimizations for capturing with 5× telephoto on iPhone 15 Pro Max, taking advantage of zero shutter lag for iPhone 15 Pro, and other enhancements. <br/>
<br/>

<a href="http://halide.cam/download">Halide 2.13</a> is a free update for existing users. There's a free one-week trial of the app, after which users can choose an annual &#36;11.99 subscription or a &#36;59.99 one-time purchase. The Halide developers have also published their annual deep dive into the new camera enhancements in Apple's latest iPhone 15 series, which can be read on the <a href="http://lux.camera/iphone-15-pro-max-review">Halide website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/halide/">Halide</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/action-button/">Action Button</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/halide-app-action-buttion-triggers-iphone-15-pro/">Halide 2.13 Features In-App Action Button Triggers on iPhone 15 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/halide-2-13-features-in-app-action-button-triggers-on-iphone-15-pro.2406313/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released an iOS 17.0.3 update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, with the software coming a week after the launch of iOS 17.0.2. Apple has also released a new version of iPadOS, 17.0.3, for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.0.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915213" /><br/>
The iOS 17.0.3 and iPadOS 17.0.3 updates can be downloaded on eligible iPhones and iPads over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.0.3, which is build 21A360, addresses a significant overheating issue on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. Shortly after the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models launched, customers began complaining that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max were getting too warm, and even shutting down due to heat problems in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">confirmed that there was a bug</a> in late September, and said that it would be fixed with an update to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. Some third-party apps had also been overloading the A17 Pro chip, leading to problems with heat dissipation. Apps affecting performance included Instagram, Uber, and more, and in addition to releasing an update to address the &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; issue, Apple has also been working with app developers to optimize apps causing problems.<br/>
<br/>
In comments to <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple clarified that customers experiencing temperature problems would see the issue resolved with an update, and that the titanium frame of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/">is not at fault</a>. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> claimed that the overheating was likely caused by "compromises made in the thermal system design," and he suggested that Apple would only be able to fix the issue by lowering processor performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said that it has no intention of tweaking the A17 Pro chip, and that the titanium and aluminum design of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; in fact provides better heat dissipation than the stainless steel frames used in previous models.<br/>
<br/>
The iOS 17.0.3 and iPadOS 17.0.3 updates also <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213961">address a kernel vulnerability</a> that could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges. Apple claims that it is aware that this security flaw was exploited on versions of iOS before iOS 16.6. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">Apple Releases iOS 17.0.3 With Fix for iPhone 15 Pro Overheating</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3-with-fix-for-iphone-15-pro-overheating.2406303/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week began selling the seven-year-old Beats Solo3 wireless on-ear headphones in <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MT283LL/A/beats-solo3-wireless-headphones-gold">Gold and Silver color options</a> again for &#36;199.95 on its online store. The headphones also remain available in Black, Rose Gold, and (PRODUCT)RED.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Beats-Solo3-Gold.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915448" /><br/>
Apple previously offered the Beats Solo3 in Satin Gold and Satin Silver, but the colors had been discontinued in late 2020.<br/>
<br/>
Released in 2016, the Beats Solo3 are now very old headphones with outdated technologies, such as micro-USB charging and Bluetooth 4.0, but they do have a W1 chip for quick and easy pairing with Apple devices. The headphones are more affordable than the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/beats-studio-pro-debut/">Beats Studio Pro</a>, which are regularly priced at &#36;349.95.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear how long Apple will continue to sell the Solo3, so keep in mind that the headphones could be discontinued sooner rather than later.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/beats-solo3-now-available-in-gold-and-silver/">Apple&#039;s Old Beats Solo3 Headphones Available in Gold and Silver Again</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-old-beats-solo3-headphones-available-in-gold-and-silver-again.2406288/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today refreshed its product lineup with new Pixel smartphones, a new Pixel watch, and updated Pixel earbuds, all of which will compete with Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/google-pixel-announcements.jpg" alt="" width="2060" height="1159" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915310" /><br/>
The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are Google's latest smartphones, and the Pixel 8 Pro is the high-end model that has all of Google's most recent technological advancements. It features a 6.7-inch 1 to 120Hz display, similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max, while the standard Pixel 8 has a 120Hz 6.2-inch display.<br/>
<br/>
Google has updated the design of its Pixel smartphones, adding a polished aluminum frame and matte glass for the Pro and a satin metal frame and polished back glass for the standard Pixel. Google says the devices have softer silhouettes compared to the prior-generation models, and they come in new colors. Google is using Gorilla Glass Victus for both, but the Pro has Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for better durability.<br/>
<br/>

The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are equipped with Google's Tensor G3 chip with enhanced AI capabilities that can filter out more spam calls, improve image processing, erase background noise from videos, and boost call quality. There's also a Titan <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> security chip, and with this combo, the Pixel phones have facial recognition secure enough to be used to sign in to apps and make payments.<br/>
<br/>
According to Google, the triple-lens rear camera system of the Pixel 8 Pro features better performance in low light and improvements to zoom and video capture Google added a new Video Boost technology for HDR+ and enhanced color grading, and the camera also supports Night Sight Video.<br/>
<br/>
With the updated Tensor chip, Google is promising that the Pixel 8 devices will get operating system and security updates for seven years, which will rival what Apple delivers with iOS.<br/>
<br/>
One of the main selling points of the Pixel 8 Pro is a new thermometer, which can tell you the temperature of an object with just a camera scan. Google is also touting updated Google Assistant functionality, with the Assistant able to translate, read aloud, and summarize web pages, as well as distill key points about what's on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
The Pixel 8 Pro is priced starting at &#36;999, which is the same starting price as Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, and the Pixel 8 is priced starting at &#36;699. Best Buy is currently offering pre-order bonuses for both devices, with <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMzlP4MXC">Pixel 8 Pro purchases including a free Pixel Watch 2</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMzmouv1Q">Pixel 8 pre-orders including free Pixel Buds Pro</a>, with more details on those devices below. Pre-order customers can also receive up to &#36;800 off with a qualified trade-in.<br/>
<br/>
Google's new smartphones were introduced alongside the Pixel Watch 2 (<a href="https://howl.me/ckIMATg3ne2">&#36;349.99 for Wi-Fi</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMASGbw3K">&#36;399.99 for cellular</a>), which incorporates more advanced heart rate tracking and stress detection from Fitbit. There are new body-response and skin temperature sensors that work alongside heart rate and heart rate variability to detect potential signs of stress or reactions from alcohol, caffeine, and other substances.<br/>
<br/>

The Pixel Watch 2 directly adopts an Apple feature, Safety Check. Google says that with Safety Check, you can let friends and family know where you are, setting a timer for a check in. When that timer expires, Safety Check prompts you to confirm that you are okay, and if there is no response, real-time location information is shared with emergency contacts.<br/>
<br/>
As for battery life, the Pixel Watch 2 is now able to last for up to 24 hours, and it charges to full in 75 minutes. Design wise, it is lighter than the prior model, and it has a thinner domed cover over the circular face.<br/>
<br/>
Google is also updating the <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMFeCRY5e">&#36;199.99 Pixel Buds Pro</a> with new colors and new AI-powered features such as clearer calling for reduced noise, hearing wellness measurements that keep track of how loud your music is, conversation detection that pauses music when you start speaking, and improved latency through a new low-latency mode. Aside from the new colors, the updated feature set is available to all Pixel Buds Pro through a software update.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook netted around &#36;41.5 million after taxes this week after selling 511,000 shares of Apple stock that he received as part of a performance-based award, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019323000089/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1696381457.xml">filing</a> released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Tim-Cook-MacBook-16x9.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894618" /><br/>
The stock award was determined based on Apple's total shareholder return relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 between the first day of Apple's 2021 fiscal year and the final day of Apple's 2023 fiscal year. Based on this metric, Apple ranked 141 of the 480 companies that were included in the S&P 500.<br/>
<br/>
Cook still owns nearly 3.3 million shares of Apple following the sale, the filing indicates.<br/>
<br/>
Cook was awarded an additional 73,010 restricted stock units, with one-third of the units to vest on April 1 each year in 2026, 2027, and 2028. He was also awarded 219,030 performance-based restricted stock units that are scheduled to vest on October 1, 2026, but this amount is subject to change based on Apple's S&P 500 performance.<br/>
<br/>
In a 2015 interview with <em><a href="https://fortune.com/2015/03/26/tim-cook/">Fortune</a></em>, Cook said that he planned to give away all his wealth, after paying for his nephew's college education. Cook said that he would take a "systematic approach to philanthropy."<br/>
<br/>
Cook has been CEO of Apple since 2011, and he has worked at the company for 25 years.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/tim-cook-nets-41-million-from-apple-stock-sale/">Tim Cook Nets &#36;41.5 Million After Selling Over 500,000 Apple Shares</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-nets-41-5-million-after-selling-over-500-000-apple-shares.2406274/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 have been out for a few weeks now, and Amazon is still offering launch discounts on both wearables. You can get &#36;9 off the Apple Watch Series 9 and up to &#36;25 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with no coupon code required.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-and-Ultra-2-Deals-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913210" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Although not particularly steep discounts, Amazon's prices are solid for anyone who's planning to pick up one of the new Apple Watches soon. Most models can be delivered as soon as October 6 for Prime members and around October 9 for free delivery options.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWYVS23%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;25 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;774.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Amazon only has one Apple Watch Ultra 2 model at the new all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWYVS23%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;774.00</strong></a> (Indigo Alpine Loop, Large). You'll find a large collection of other models at &#36;779.99, which is still a solid &#36;19 discount for these brand new watches. <br/>
<br/>
Another highlight is the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDJM3151%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;219.99</strong></a> with an on-page coupon discount, down from &#36;249.99. Only one color is available at this second-best price, the Midnight Aluminum with Midnight Sport Band. You can also get the 44mm GPS Apple Watch SE model at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDJ9M1HG%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;249.99</strong></a> with an on-page coupon discount, down from &#36;279.00. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> are now Apple's most inexpensive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> options, starting at &#36;429 and &#36;599, respectively. Apple released the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; in late 2021 and has bumped it down in price since then to make it more accessible as new models have been released. On the other hand, the third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-announces-new-iphone-se/">launched in early 2022</a>, refreshing the most affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; option in the lineup.<br/>

With just &#36;170 between them, should you get the smaller entry-level &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that still has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> Home button or the all-screen model that has come down in price over time?

<br/>
Overall, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; remains an excellent entry-level &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; option for just &#36;429. It contains the A15 Bionic chip, which is still widely available across Apple's lineup of devices and offers more than sufficient performance. With &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj;, wireless charging, water resistance, a capable rear camera, and the latest version of iOS, it is a great smartphone for those new to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and have basic needs. Some users value the more traditional design, Home Button, and size of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;, but there is no escaping the fact that the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; offers an older and more basic &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; experience with a design dating back to 2014's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6.<br/>
<br/>
For &#36;170 more, the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; offers a decidedly more modern and advanced smartphone experience thanks to a much more modern design and a brighter, OLED display, as well as &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, an Ultra Wide camera, Cinematic mode, Night mode, considerably better front-facing and rear cameras, &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, and longer battery life. There is also the benefit of improved water resistance, the ultra wideband chip for Precision Finding with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>, and Dolby Atmos audio playback. There are even additional color options to choose from. All of this makes for a significant upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; if you can afford the &#36;170 extra, but it is worth bearing in mind that they are not essential capabilities for many users.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is an excellent device if your needs or budget are limited, but there is no doubt that the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;'s larger display, more modern and durable design, brighter OLED display, better cameras, longer battery life, and &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; compatibility are universally beneficial. In most cases, this is worth the &#36;170 extra if you can afford it.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that the next-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, which is not expected to launch until 2025, is expected to be based on the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;'s all-screen design. This means that buying an &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; is also likely to be a much more future-proof purchase, looking reasonably up to date compared to Apple's other devices in the coming years.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-vs-iphone-13/">iPhone SE vs. iPhone 13 Buyer&#039;s Guide: Comparing Apple&#039;s Cheapest iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-vs-iphone-13-buyers-guide-comparing-apples-cheapest-iphones.2406264/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models are set to receive a new Double Tap gesture later this month in an upcoming software update. Here's everything Double Tap can do, and how you can get it working on your watch today. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910334" /><br/>
Double Tap is a new gesture-based feature for the latest Apple Watch models that lets you control watch functions by tapping your thumb and index finger together twice. The feature aims to make it easier to navigate the Apple Watch when you have only one hand free, like when you're walking a dog, carrying groceries, or holding a cup of coffee.<br/>
<br/>
The new Double Tap gesture is <strong>exclusive to the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2</strong>, and will be enabled with the release of watchOS 10.1 in October. watchOS 10.1 is currently available today as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">developer beta</a>. If you want to install the beta on your watch, it will need to be paired to an iPhone running the iOS 17.1 beta, which you can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-ios-17-beta-iphone/">download for free</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What Double Tap Can Do</h2><br/>
Double Tap's functionality is pretty simple. You raise your watch to wake, and then you double tap your thumb and index finger together to control what's happening on the screen of your watch. <br/>
<br/>
By default, Double Tap selects the primary button in whatever app you're in. So for example, if you get a call, you can double tap to answer, and use it to hang up when you're done. Likewise, if you're watching/listening to media, you can pause it and resume it (or skip). <br/>
<br/>
Some other use cases: If you've set a timer, double-tapping will pause it. Performing the gesture again will resume the countdown, and when the timer goes off, a double-tap will stop it. Similarly, you can use it to do other everyday things like snooze alarms, trigger the Camera Remote app's shutter button, and dismiss notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-double-tap.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913385" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Double Tap activation is indicated by a blue icon at the top of the screen</em></div><br/>
As you might expect, the gesture is also set up to assume your other hand is preoccupied. If you receive a text, for instance, a double tap lets you reply with a voice message, while another double tap sends the message.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Double Tap can be used to invoke the Smart Stack from the watch face and advance through your widgets, offering you a one-handed glance of your most regularly viewed information. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Set Up Double Tap</h2><br/>
Double Tap is disabled by default, so you will need to enable it manually for it to work. This can be done from your wrist or in the Watch app on iPhone, and both menus include options to customize Media Playback and Smart Stack functionality. <br/>
<br/>
Note that to enable Double Tap, setup involves giving watchOS permission to disable some Accessibility options, including Assistive Touch, Zoom with Hand Gestures, VoiceOver with Hand Gestures, and Quick Actions.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>On Apple Watch:</h3><br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Double Tap</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Double Tap</strong> on the next screen.</li><br/>
<li>If prompted, tap <strong>Turn off Accessibility Features</strong> at the bottom of the on-screen alert.</li><br/>
<li>Choose your preferred setting for "Playback" (<strong>Play/Pause</strong> or <strong>Skip</strong>) and "Smart Stack" (<strong>Advance</strong> or <strong>Select</strong>).</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/enable-double-tap2.jpg" alt="settings" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915348" /><br/>
<br/>
<h3>On iPhone:</h3><br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Watch</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>With the "My Watch" tab selected, tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Double Tap</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Double Tap</strong> on the next screen.</li><br/>
<li>If prompted, tap <strong>Turn off Accessibility Features</strong> in the on-screen alert.</li><br/>
<li>Choose your preferred setting for "Playback" (<strong>Play/Pause</strong> or <strong>Skip</strong>) and "Smart Stack" (<strong>Advance</strong> or <strong>Select</strong>).</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/enable-double-tap1.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915349" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple says Double Tap is enabled by the S9 chip's faster Neural Engine, which is why the feature is only available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2. Apple said it developed an algorithm that detects the "unique signature" of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb are tapped together.<br/>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/paypal.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915339" /><br/>
The new integration means users can use the cards to make contactless payments in-store, and use iPhones, iPads, and Macs to make purchases in apps and on the web using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
To get started, users should open the Apple Wallet app, tap the + button, then select the add "Debit or Credit Card" option. Cards can then be scanned or card details entered manually. PayPal says that users will be able to do this directly in the PayPal or Venmo apps in the coming months. <br/>
<br/>
When making payments with &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, users can earn 2% on purchases with the PayPal Cashback Credit Card, earn PayPal Rewards points when shopping with the PayPal Debit Card and redeem them for cash back or other rewards, and earn cashback with the Venmo Debit Card at participating businesses.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second beta of an upcoming iOS 17.1 update, and the software further refines some of the new features that were added both in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and the initial iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.1-Feature-Fall-Muted.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915266" /><br/>
This guide covers everything new in the second iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>StandBy Display Options</h2><br/>
Apple added a new "Display" section to the StandBy section of the Settings app, which houses some new customization options. The display can be set to turn off automatically, after 20 seconds, or never.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/standby-display-settings-ios-17-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915259" /><br/>
The existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/">Night Mode</a> function that adds a red tint and dims the screen has been relocated to this section, as has the Motion to Wake toggle. The Display section also replaces the prior Always On toggle that limited the display to turning off intelligently.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Ringtones and Text Tones</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 beta 1 removed the more than 20 ringtones and text tones that were added in the launch version of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, but they have been reintroduced.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-1-ringtones.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915262" /><br/>
The new ringtones include Arpeggio, Breaking, Canopy, Chalet, Chirp, Daybreak, Departure, Dollop, Journey, Kettle, Mercury, Milky Way, Quad, Radial, Scavenger, Seedling, Shelter, Sprinkles, Steps, Storytime, Tease, Tilt, Unfold, and Valley. Reflection continues to be the default ringtone option.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the old ringtones, many of the new ringtones are longer in length and sound more modern. Apple has moved all of the prior ringtones to the "Classic" section so they are still accessible for those who prefer options like Illuminate, Night Owl, Constellation, and Twinkle.<br/>
<br/>
There are more than 10 new text tones that can be used for incoming text messages, voicemails, incoming mail alerts, reminder alerts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>80% Charging Limit Fix</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, Apple added a toggle that prevents the devices from charging past 80 percent in order to keep the battery healthy for a longer period of time. In the prior beta, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> would ignore this setting and charge past 80 percent, but that no longer happens following the second beta update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-1-80-percent-charge.jpg" alt="" width="2166" height="1218" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915260" /><br/>
<h2>Double Tap</h2><br/>
Double Tap is enabled in the second watchOS 10.1 beta that was provided to developers today, but the settings for it can be managed using the Apple Watch app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/watchos-10-1-double-tap.jpg" alt="" width="2901" height="1632" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915258" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix plans to increase the price of its ad-free subscription plans a few months after the end of the Hollywood actors strike, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/netflix-price-increase-actors-strike-792de9be">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884792" /><br/>
Prices will go up in the United States and Canada first, and it is not yet clear how much more Netflix will charge. Netflix <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/14/netflix-raises-prices/">last raised prices</a> at the beginning of 2022, charging &#36;9.99 per month for the Basic plan, &#36;15.49 per month for the Standard plan, and &#36;19.99 per month for the Premium plan.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix has since eliminated the Basic plan and added a Standard with ads plan that is priced at &#36;6.99 per month. The company has also ended all multi-household sharing, so Netflix users must reside in the same location to share a Netflix plan, otherwise there is an additional cost for another member slot.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple streaming services have been raising their prices this year. Ad-free Disney+ streaming will soon be &#36;13.99 per month, and ad-free Hulu is going to be &#36;17.99 per month following price hikes set to go live this month. There is no specific word yet on when Netflix will raise prices.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/netflix-price-increase/">Netflix to Raise Ad-Free Subscription Prices Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-to-raise-ad-free-subscription-prices-soon.2406185/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> code that was added to the second beta of iOS 17.1 references USB-C charging for the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, a function that does not exist for either of the two current &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models that Apple sells.<br/>
<br/>

"Connect to USB-C to recharge soon," reads the text, which is accompanied by another line that says "&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Battery Very Low."<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if this is a reference to a new version of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; or text that is related to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQLU3AM/A/usb-c-to-apple-pencil-adapter">USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter</a> that allows the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; to be charged using a 10th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. With this adapter, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; plugs in to the Lightning end of the Adapter and the USB-C connector plugs into the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, facilitating a charge over USB-C.<br/>
<br/>

Given that this adapter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/21/apple-pencil-adapter-shipping-delay/">came out last year</a>, it is not quite clear why Apple is just now adding the text, but it is a logical explanation and could be related to the possible launch of a next-generation low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The other option is that Apple is working on a new version of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with a USB-C connector.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could in theory refresh the original &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; to replace the Lightning connector with a USB-C connector without too much hassle, allowing the company to carry on offering the higher-end, slimmer magnetic &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and other iPads, and the lower-cost, rounder &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that charges via a connector and works with Apple's low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
A USB-C port might not make sense if Apple has plans for a third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; compatible with all iPads, as the new version would likely take after the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and charge magnetically via an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. A single &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that has no connector at all and is able to work with all iPads would simplify the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; lineup and cut down on any confusion.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is transitioning its products to USB-C because of new European Union regulations that require electronics to use a universal port. Apple could opt for a USB-C charging option for fast charging purposes, but a future &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; would also be able to skirt the USB-C requirement with wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not a new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; has USB-C, there seems to be a third-generation version in the works. Earlier this week, a rumor suggested that the next &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; would feature magnetic tips with different shapes for drawing, sketching, and painting.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/ios-17-1-apple-pencil-usb-c/">iOS 17.1 Code References Apple Pencil With USB-C</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-code-references-apple-pencil-with-usb-c.2406180/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
