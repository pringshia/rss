		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that it will be opening a new retail store at the Square One shopping mall in the Canadian city of Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. Apple's existing store in the mall will be permanently closed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/New-Apple-Square-One.jpg" alt="" width="3800" height="2138" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940947" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The new Apple Square One</em></div><br/>
"A brand-new Apple Store is coming soon," the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/squareone/">store's page</a> says. The teaser message was <a href="https://mastodon.social/@michaelsteeber/112084399504297364">spotted by Michael Steeber</a>, who writes a <a href="https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/">weekly newsletter about Apple retail called Tabletops</a>, and tipster <a href="https://twitter.com/ApolloZhaoD/status/1767589911169839393">Apollo Zhao</a> also alerted us to the news.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's existing store at Square One opened in August 2009. The new location is significantly larger, and will better accommodate the heavy customer traffic at Square One, the second-largest indoor shopping mall in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to share an exact opening date for the new store, and the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-teases-new-square-one-store-canada/">Apple Teases New Store &#039;Coming Soon&#039; at Square One Mall Near Toronto</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-teases-new-store-coming-soon-at-square-one-mall-near-toronto.2421756/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Video Comparison: M3 MacBook Air vs. M3 MacBook Pro</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With the refresh of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models in March, Apple now has M3 versions of the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, 14-inch MacBook Pro, and 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, all with the same chip inside. For those trying to decide between the MacBook Pro and the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, we did a comparison video to highlight what you're getting with each machine.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dsTKUHdjzVE" title="M3 MacBook AIR vs M3 MacBook PRO: Real World Differences!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
While the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and the 14-inch MacBook Pro have the same M3 chip, there is a difference with the low-end &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. At the entry-level &#36;1,099 price, the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU. The more expensive &#36;1,299 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has an 8-core CPU and upgraded 10-core GPU, with all 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and 14-inch MacBook Pro models also starting with the upgraded 10-core GPU.<br/>
<br/>
So you can get a &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for as little as &#36;1,099, but at that price point, the GPU is downgraded. That won't matter for general day-to-day use, but it's something to keep in mind. The 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;1,299, and the 14-inch MacBook Pro is priced starting at &#36;1,599, so there is a major price difference.<br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro is priced higher because it starts with a 512GB SSD instead of 256GB like the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, and because it has a better display. Apple uses a mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR display that has ProMotion with refresh rates up to 120Hz and up to 1,600 nits peak brightness. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has an LCD display with up to 500 nits brightness, so the real notable difference between the machines is the display quality.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/">Mini-LED</a> offers deeper blacks, more vivid colors, and it overall just looks better, especially for work where color is important like photo editing and for watching movies or other HDR content. There are no fans inside the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, while the MacBook Pro has fans for active cooling. In theory, you could see better performance out of the M3 with the active cooling when using very system intensive tasks. Ports are another difference, with the MacBook Pro featuring an HDMI 2.1 port and an SDXC card slot in addition to two Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; doesn't have the extra ports, and is limited to the two Thunderbolt 4 ports.<br/>
<br/>
Both versions of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; are thinner and lighter than the 14-inch MacBook Pro, so the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; wins out when it comes to portability, but the MacBook Pro has longer battery life (18 hours for the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; vs. 22 hours for the MacBook Pro. Other specs are largely the same, though there are some differences in speaker and microphone quality.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro is more expensive but has better display quality, while the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; wins out when it comes to portability and price. Choosing one will depend on workload, but the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is the computer that we recommend for most people. You'll want to go with the MacBook Pro if display quality is important or if there are specific ports you need.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch Ultra project</a> may have lost another key supplier, according to Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-hero-feature-white.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911671" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ixviewer/ix.html?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/56978/000005697824000042/klic-20240311.htm">filing</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, manufacturing equipment company Kulicke & Soffa said that one of its "strategic customers" has canceled a project related to the "advanced display" market:<blockquote>Previously referred to as Project W, the Company has been engaged with one of its strategic customers (the "Customer") to support the Customer with the development and future mass production of certain technologies relating to advanced display (the "Project"). In connection with the Customer's strategic review of its business, the Customer has informed the Company that it has cancelled the Project.</blockquote>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1767341370845598076">social media post</a> on Monday, Young suggested that "Project W" was potentially related to the microLED Apple Watch. The company said it expects to incur charges of up to &#36;130 million as a result of ceasing operations related to the project.<br/>
<br/>
Kulicke & Soffa's website advertises a "next generation LED die transfer" system for microLED and miniLED displays with "an unprecedented transfer rate at high precision." <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Apple supplier AMS-Osram <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled-for-now/">similarly announced</a> it would "re-assess its microLED strategy" after a "cornerstone project" was "unexpectedly cancelled." Young believes that project also related to the microLED Apple Watch, so there are now at least two major suppliers that have indicated they are no longer involved.<br/>
<br/>
Both <a href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/blog/apple-cancels-microled-project">Display Supply Chain Consultants</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/kuo-says-microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> believe that Apple has outright canceled the microLED Apple Watch project for now, but other sources like <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and <em>DigiTimes</em> have <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1763297383046365515">cast doubt</a> and believe that Apple has or is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-still-dedicated-microled-apple-watch-ultra/">actively seeking alternative suppliers</a> for the project.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, a microLED Apple Watch Ultra appears to remain several years away at a minimum.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/microled-apple-watch-potential-supplier-lost/">MicroLED Apple Watch Ultra Project Potentially Loses Another Supplier</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microled-apple-watch-ultra-project-potentially-loses-another-supplier.2421730/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Resale value trends suggest the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> 4 may not hold its value as well as Apple's flagship models, according to <a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/is-iphone-se-4-worth-the-wait/">SellCell</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
According to the report, Apple's &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; models have historically depreciated much more rapidly than the company's more premium offerings. The third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, which launched in March 2022, experienced a significant drop in resale value, losing 42.6% within the first month post-launch.<br/>
<br/>
This depreciation rate contrasts starkly with that of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, which only saw an 18.7% decrease in the same time frame. The &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;'s value stabilized after three months, a resilience not seen in the third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, which continued to depreciate. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and 15 models have also demonstrated stronger value retention compared to the third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, further illustrating the gap between Apple's budget and flagship lines.<br/>
<br/>
These trends suggest that, despite a host of rumored upgrades, the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; may still face steeper depreciation than Apple's higher-end models. This pattern of value loss might discourage some consumers from investing in the next-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, particularly those who prioritize resale value in their purchase decision.<br/>
<br/>
The faster depreciation rate of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; could be attributed to several factors, including the perception of these devices as entry-level options, technological advancements that make models that use older technologies obsolete more rapidly, and consumer preference for high-end features.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is rumored to feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14-like design with a 6.1-inch OLED display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> instead of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, a USB-C port, an Action button, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. It is expected to launch in 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/">SellCell</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-4/">iPhone SE 4</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/iphone-se-4-expected-to-depreciate-heavily/">iPhone SE 4 Expected to Depreciate Heavily</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-expected-to-depreciate-heavily.2421724/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Citing two individuals familiar with the matter, <em>Business Insider</em> claims that the AI-powered tool mirrors the functionalities of Google's Performance Max and Meta's Advantage+, which allow advertisers to specify their budget, target cost-per-acquisition, desired audiences, and geographical targets. Apple's algorithm then automatically determines the most effective placement of ads across the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;'s existing formats.<br/>
<br/>
The initiative is said to be part of Apple's broader ambition to refine and expand its advertising offerings. Currently, Apple provides a variety of ad formats within the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, including search tab ads, search results page ads, "you might also like" suggestions on app product pages, and ads on the "today" tab.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Business Insider</em> speculates that the move toward AI-enhanced ad placements suggests a future where Apple could extend advertising to other apps and services within its ecosystem, such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a>, Stocks, and the recently launched Sports app. The website also today reported that a number of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/ads-for-apple-tv-job-hires-suggest/">recent Apple hiring decisions</a> may indicate plans to introduce an ad-supported <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> tier.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/businessinsider-com/">Business Insider</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-testing-ai-ad-tool/">Apple Reportedly Testing AI-Powered Ad Technology</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-testing-ai-powered-ad-technology.2421712/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[TikTok appears to be planning to expand into photo sharing via the launch of a new "TikTok Photos" app, according to <a href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Tiktok-Photo-Sharing-Platform.html">TheSpAndroid</a> blog.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-752609" /><br/>
A large number of references to the app were discovered in the latest version of TikTok, revealing some of its functionality, integrations, and even its app icon. Among these, phrases like "Open TikTok Photos," "Get TikTok Photos," and "Share this post to TikTok Photos" suggest direct connections between the existing video platform and the new photo-sharing app. <br/>
<br/>
TikTok has allowed users to post photo-based content in a video or carousel format for some time, but the app currently has no real alternative to dedicated photo-sharing social media platforms. TikTok Photos likely seeks to directly challenge Instagram's dominance in the photo-sharing space. Instagram has increasingly focused on video content, including Reels, in an effort to compete with TikTok's video dominance.<br/>
<br/>
The official launch date and regional availability of "TikTok Photos" is unknown, but the presence of extensive references to it within TikTok's code suggests that an announcement could be imminent.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple could be accelerating plans to introduce an ad-supported <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> tier, based on a number of recent hires by the company.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/apple-tv-plus-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-812603" /><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-hired-nbcu-tv-exec-video-ad-ambitions-2024-3">Business Insider</a></em> reports that Apple recently recruited Joseph Cady, who worked as an ad executive for NBCUniversal for over 14 years. Cady's focus was on data-driven and targeted advertising, including responsibility for the Comcast subsidiary's partnerships with Amazon, Google, TikTok, and others, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
Cady is expected to work with Winston Crawford, Apple's head of global ad sales. Apple's TV+ team reports to Crawford, who also helped lead Apple's Major League Soccer ad sales pitch with Todd Teresi, lead of Apple's ads division.<br/>
<br/>
The report also mentions several other recent recruits to Apple's ads team, such as Chandler Taylor (formerly a video ads account manager with Peacock), Jacqueline Bleazey from FanDuel's ad sales team, and Jason Brum, who has worked for DirecTV, NBCUniversal, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not indicated one way or the other whether an ad-supported tier for TV+ is in the works, but it would make sense given that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/04/netflix-basic-with-ads-plan-doesnt-work-apple-tv/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/10/disney-plus-price-changes-ad-supported-tier/">Disney+</a>, and Max all now offer ad-based plans at a discounted price.<br/>
<br/>
Apple increased its TV+ subscription prices in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">October</a> to &#36;9.99 a month from &#36;6.99 a month, while the annual subscription price increased from &#36;69 per year to &#36;99 per year, so a more affordable option would make sense from a competitive perspective.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/ads-for-apple-tv-job-hires-suggest/">Cheaper Apple TV+ With Ads Plan a Possibility, Recent Job Hires Suggest</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cheaper-apple-tv-with-ads-plan-a-possibility-recent-job-hires-suggest.2421704/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="http://developer.apple.com/news">announced</a> three further changes for developers in the European Union, allowing them to distribute apps directly from webpages, choose how to design in-app promotions, and more. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-933094" /><br/>
Apple last week enabled alternative app stores in the EU <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/">in iOS 17.4</a>, allowing third-party app stores to offer a catalog of other developers' apps as well as the marketplace developer's own apps. As of today, Apple is allowing third-party app stores to offer apps solely from their own catalog. For example, a games studio could create an app store on iOS that exclusively offers their own games.<br/>
<br/>
When directing users to complete a transaction on their website, developers can also now choose how to design their in-app promotions, discounts, and deals. Apple's templates for designing these links out to websites are optional as of today.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, developers will soon be able to distribute apps directly from their websites, providing they meet Apple's specific criteria, such as being a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and having an app with more than one million first installs on iOS in the EU in the prior year, and commit to ongoing requirements, such as publishing transparent data collection policies. Apps distributed in this way must meet Apple's notarization requirements like all other iOS apps and can only be installed from a web domain registered in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Connect.<br/>
<br/>
Authorized developers will gain access to APIs to facilitate app distribution from the web, integration with system functionality, back up and restore, and more. Web distribution will become available following a software update later in the spring – allowing app downloads directly from a website for the first time on iOS. <br/>
<br/>
The latest changes are part of Apple's Digital Markets Act (DMA) compliance plan and only apply within the European Union.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">Apple Announces Ability to Download iPhone Apps From Websites in EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-ability-to-download-iphone-apps-from-websites-in-eu.2421702/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

In a statement shared with the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3255102/apple-expand-applied-research-labs-shanghai-and-shenzhen-iphone-sales-weaken-worlds-largest"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a>, Apple said that it plans to expand its research center in Shanghai "to support all of its product lines," as well as open a new lab in Shenzhen later in 2024 that will work on testing and research of major products including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Vision Pro headset. The company added that the new facility in Shenzhen will strengthen its collaboration with local suppliers and support local employees.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's vice-president and managing director of Greater China, Isabel Ge Mahe, said that the company is proud to cultivate deeper ties in China and expand its presence in the country. Apple has already invested &#36;139.2 million into its Shanghai research center, she added.

Apple first added cycling directions to &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; in iOS 14, providing specific directions for bike riders with bike lanes, bike paths, and bike-friendly routes that highlight steep inclines, stairs, and other obstacles.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in Europe, &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; currently provides cycling routes across France and Germany, as well as in Barcelona, Spain, and London, England. Coverage is more widespread in other parts of the world, such as mainland China, Japan, the United States, and select cities in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#maps-cycling">maintains a list</a> of all of the areas where cycling directions are available on its website, but Belgium, Austria, and Sweden have yet to be added.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in collaboration with other browser engine developers has <a href="https://browserbench.org/announcements/speedometer3/">announced</a> the release of Speedometer 3.0, <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/15131/speedometer-3-0-the-best-way-yet-to-measure-browser-performance/">described by Apple</a> as "the best way yet to measure browser benchmark performance." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/speedometer-3-0.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940788" /><blockquote>Apple's WebKit team is excited to introduce Speedometer 3.0, a major update that better reflects the Web of today. It's built together by the developers of all major browser engines: Blink, Gecko, and WebKit with hundreds of contributions from companies like Apple, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Mozilla. </blockquote>Apple's WebKit team originally released the benchmark tool in collaboration with the Google Chrome team in 2014, but this is the first time the Speedometer benchmark has been developed through a cross-industry collaboration supported by each major browser engine.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of developing and releasing Speedometer under a joint multi-stakeholder governance model is to "create a shared understanding of web performance so that improvements can be made to enhance the user experience," according to the announcement. The latest version improves how Speedometer captures and calculates scores, shows more detailed results and introduces a wider variety of workloads.<br/>
<br/>
"A few tests and workloads can't simulate the entire web,"  admit the contributors. "But while building Speedometer 3 we have established some criteria for selecting ones that are critical to user's experience. We are now closer to a representative benchmark than ever before."<br/>
<br/>
Speedometer 3.0 takes into account the most common versions of popular frameworks including React, Vue, Angular, Preact, Lit, Backbone, and Svelte. It also features an updated set of simulated workloads to measure more of the work the browser does in response to user actions, such as painting and asynchronous tasks.  <br/>
 <br/>
In addition, there is improved developer tooling so that browser engineers can better understand results, profile, and customize the test. The test runner architecture has also been redesigned to make it easier to write and maintain complex test cases. <br/>
<br/>
Speedometer 3.0 is available to use today on the <a href="https://browserbench.org/Speedometer3.0/">BrowserBench.org website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/">Benchmarks</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/webkit/">WebKit</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-speedometer-3-0-browser-benchmark/">Apple, Google, and Others Announce Speedometer 3.0 Browser Benchmark</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-google-and-others-announce-speedometer-3-0-browser-benchmark.2421695/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models are expected to be announced in a matter of weeks, so what can customers expect from the highly anticipated new machines?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
The 2022 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was a minor update that added the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> hover, and specification upgrades like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; as a whole has generally only seen relatively small updates in recent years, but rumors indicate that the next-generation ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ will be the first major update to the product since 2018, introducing "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">fundamental changes</a>." Below are some of the most important rumors about the new machines to be aware of as we approach their announcement.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Revamped, Thinner Design</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has retained the same design through four successive generations since 2018. Multiple reports suggest that the biggest design change coming to the new models will be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">substantial reduction in thickness</a>, reducing from 5.9 mm to 5.1mm and 6.4mm to 5.0 mm, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/13-inch-ipad-pro-2024.jpg" alt="" width="3832" height="1316" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938781" /><br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/2024-ipad-pro-cad-drawings/">CAD renders</a> indicate that there will be no other major design changes, but there have been vague <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">reports</a> about the device potentially featuring a landscape front-facing camera like the 10th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, a much more natural placement for video calls when using a Magic Keyboard. Rumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/24/rumor-ipad-pro-horizontal-cameras-apple-logo/">dating back to 2021</a> have suggested that a relocated front-facing camera is headed to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Such a change would likely also require changes to the location or charging system of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, since the wireless charging components for the accessory are currently located where the camera would move to.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier rumors suggested that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">glass back</a> could come to a future &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; model, which would be a major design change for the device, but it is no longer clear if this is still a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Chip for Improved Performance</h3><br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is widely expected to feature Apple's M3 chip to deliver improved performance and efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/m3-feature-black.jpg" alt="" width="1810" height="1018" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-827879" /><br/>
The M3 is based on the A17 Pro chip, which is manufactured using TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> fabrication process. In benchmark tests, the M3 outperforms the ‌‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌‌ by about 17% in single-core tasks and approximately 21% in multi-core tasks. A tentpole feature of the M3 is a completely redesigned GPU with hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, leading to dramatically improved graphics capabilities. In GPU performance, measured by Metal benchmarks, the M3 exhibits a notable improvement of around 15% over the ‌‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌‌.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>4TB Storage Option</h3><br/>
Apple will offer next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models with a 4TB storage option, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/ipad-pro-may-have-4tb-storage-option/">rumor</a> coming out of Asia claimed. Since 2021, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has been available with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple increases the maximum storage of its forthcoming &zwnj;OLED &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro&zwnj; models to 4TB, it would likely also increase the base storage to 256GB to maintain five capacity categories, making all seventh-generation models capable of recording ProRes in 4K at 30fps.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; RAM is variable based on storage capacity, so &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage come with 8GB of RAM, while &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with 1TB or 2TB of storage feature 16GB of RAM. Whether that means a 4TB &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; would feature 24GB or 32GB of RAM is unknown, but not improbable.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>OLED Display Technology</h3><br/>
OLED display technology is perhaps the most anticipated upgrade coming to the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. The current 11-inch model features an LCD display, while the 12.9-inch model has a mini-LED display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
Apple already uses OLED displays on the Apple Watch and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but has yet to bring the technology to larger devices. OLED displays use less power, sport greater color accuracy, and provide much better and more consistent contrast than LCD displays. As a significant upgrade, the change will likely be very prominent in the Apple's marketing materials for the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Bigger Screens and Slimmer Bezels?</h3><br/>
The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are also rumored to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/">display size increases</a> from 11- to 11.1-inches and 12.9- to 13-inches, facilitated by slimmer borders around the screen. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/ipad-pro-m1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1780" height="1001" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-800056" /><br/>
This would allow the footprint of the devices to remain the same while increasing display size. The slight increases are unlikely to add any meaningful functionality to the device, but they would provide a more modern "all-screen" appearance. However, display analyst Ross Young has since cast doubt on this rumor as it may simply be a misinterpretation of screen size rounding.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Higher Prices</h3><br/>
The more advanced OLED display technology in the next-generation models is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">drive up the iPad Pro's price</a>, with current estimates starting at &#36;1,500 and &#36;1,800 for the 11-inch and 13-inch models, respectively. Pricing on the current 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;799, while the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,099. Models with cellular connectivity are available for an additional &#36;200 over the base price for each storage tier.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/oled-ipad-pro-price-lower-than-first-thought/">More recent reports</a> suggest that the price hikes may have been overstated and they may not exceed a &#36;160 increase, but it does look like higher prices are on the way.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Improved Cameras</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has had the same 12-megapixel main rear camera with a ƒ/1.8 aperture since 2017. The 12-megapixel ultra wide camera with an ƒ/2.4 aperture and brighter True Tone flash have also remained the same since its introduction on the 2021 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Camera upgrades are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">rumored for other future iPad models</a> with related hardware such as the seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, so it follows that similar improvements are on the way for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2021, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has also featured a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an ƒ/2.4 aperture. With 2022's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, Apple introduced an upgraded 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an ƒ/1.9 aperture and autofocus. It seems plausible that this hardware could be ready to trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; in its next incarnation.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pros support Smart HDR 4, so an upgrade to Smart HDR 5 is likely. The Photonic Engine and other iPhone-only photography and videography features could also make their way to the next &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>MagSafe Wireless Charging</h3><br/>
In 2022, it was reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">testing a new iPad Pro with a glass back</a> to enable wireless charging capabilities. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPad-Pro-Magsafe-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-926995" /><br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/14/ipad-pro-glass-apple-logo-prototype-report/">subsequent report</a> suggested that Apple may have ultimately scrapped the glass back design after testing due to concerns over breakability. Citing sources familiar with Apple's design plans, the report claimed that Apple has developed &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; prototypes with a larger Apple logo made of glass, which would still allow for wireless charging. One of the prototypes was said to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> with stronger magnets than on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to prevent accidental damage, and it was also said to support faster wireless charging speeds compared to &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There is no guarantee that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with a glass back or Apple logo will ever be released, but rumors do seem to agree that Apple has extensively explored some kind of wireless charging solution for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. In December, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">obtained information</a> suggesting that the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models might include support for &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging, and this now appears to be Apple's chosen wireless charging technology for the device.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">reverse wireless charging</a> for the ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌, which would allow users to charge their iPhones, AirPods, and other accessories by laying them on the back of the ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/apple-researching-wireless-charging-ecosystem/">filed multiple patents</a> related to this feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Redesigned Magic Keyboard for 'Laptop' Experience</h3><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">complete revamp</a> of its Magic Keyboard accessory for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; that makes the device more laptop-like. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/11/m1-ipad-pro-magic-keyboards.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-795764" /><br/>
The updated version of the Magic Keyboard for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will offer a larger trackpad, addressing criticisms of the current model, and "makes the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; look even more like a laptop than the current setup." The area around the keyboard itself will apparently be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">made of aluminum</a>, resembling the top case of MacBooks, to provide a sturdier structure.<br/>
<br/>
The exterior shell of the keyboard will retain the silicone cover material used on the current model and a single USB-C port. Gurman mused that the redesign using more premium materials could lead Apple to raise the accessory's &#36;299 price point.<br/>
<br/>
The Weibo leaker known as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">"Instant Digital" claims</a> that the next-generation Magic Keyboard will also be 100% carbon neutral thanks to its redesign and use of different materials. Last year, Apple unveiled its first carbon neutral products: The aluminum <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> when paired with a new Sport Loop, as well as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> when paired with a new Trail Loop or Alpine Loop. The company plans for all of its products to be carbon neutral by 2030.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New Apple Pencil</h3><br/>
A new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/">actively rumored</a> to arrive alongside the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. The current, second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is now well over five years old.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Pencil-on-iPad-Close.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939788" /><br/>
In March 2021, the leaker known as "Mr. White" shared an image purporting to depict a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/">next-generation Apple Pencil prototype</a> that featured a shorter design, glossy finish, and a larger, deeper tip. Apple was believed to have worked on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-working-on-smaller-apple-pencil/">smaller Apple Pencil</a> designed for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, as well as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/apple-planned-iphone-apple-pencil/">&#36;49 model for the iPhone</a>, but both products never emerged and are said to have been canceled entirely.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">Multiple rumors</a> suggested that the third-generation will include range of interchangeable magnetic tips to emulate different drawing styles. There have also been report about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/">color-sampling capabilities</a>, but little else is known about what the new accessory could offer later this month.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>No Apple Event, But Announcement Any Day Now</h3> <br/>
Reports from a wide range of sources are consistent that the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be announced in March. While it was initially speculated that Apple would host an event to introduce the new models, the company is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">no longer expected to hold a traditional event</a> for the announcements. Instead, Apple is reportedly planning to announce new products on its website with a "series of online videos and marketing campaigns."<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Apple announced the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models featuring the M3 chip, so this rumor now seems to be true. As a result, Apple is highly likely to reveal the new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pros via a press release on its website during a morning in the next few weeks, likely on a Monday or Tuesday, followed by launch on a following Friday. The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models may launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/">toward the end of the month or in April</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj;, but they could appear as soon as tomorrow.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/2024-ipad-pro-key-rumors/">2024 iPad Pro: Key Rumors to Be Aware of Ahead of Announcement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2024-ipad-pro-key-rumors-to-be-aware-of-ahead-of-announcement.2421676/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shortly after the Vision Pro launched, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made it clear that he believes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">Quest 3 is the better VR headset</a>, and over the weekend, he again <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C4Rrh9wrbU0">took to Threads</a> to reiterate his belief that the &#36;3,500 Vision Pro is inferior to the &#36;500 Quest 3 (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/11/zuckerberg-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3/"><em>9to5Mac</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914163" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg" alt="" width="1385" height="779" /><br/>
Analyst Benedict Evans said that the Vision Pro is the "device Meta wants to reach in 3-5 years," and that it is confusing that Meta VR engineers have suggested the Vision Pro is "basically just the same thing" as the Quest. In response, Zuckerberg said that the Quest "is better" than the Vision Pro now, and that if the Meta Quest has the "motion blur," weight, or "lack of precision inputs" as the Vision Pro in the future, then Meta will have "regressed significantly."<br/>
<blockquote>I don't think we're saying the devices are the same. We're saying Quest is better. If our devices weigh as much as theirs in 3-5 years, or have the motion blur theirs has, or the lack of precision inputs, etc, then that means we'll have regressed significantly. Yes, their resolution is higher, but they paid for that with many other product tradeoffs that make their device worse in most ways. That's not what we aspire to.</blockquote><br/>
Zuckerberg also took offense to the Meta Quest being called "a games device," and clarified that some of the top apps on the Quest are social, browser, and video player apps.<br/>
<blockquote>Actually, 3 of the top 7 Quest apps are already social apps - Horizon, VR Chat, and Rec Room. Browser and video player are top apps too. Fitness isn't as high up there, but has a passionate community as well. So I think the narrative that these headsets are only for games is out of date. And yes, more resolution is better - but trading off ergonomics and motion blur isn't a clear win when Quest's resolution is also quite good.</blockquote><br/>
Device weight and "motion blur" have been two points that Zuckerberg has focused on in his criticism of the Vision Pro, and he has dismissed the higher resolution of Apple's headset as unnecessary given the "tradeoffs" that he sees.<br/>
<br/>
Zuckerberg in February said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">the Quest 3 is superior</a> because it is 7x less expensive than the Vision Pro, it's more comfortable, the Quest is "crisper," there are "precision controllers," and there's a "deeper" immersive content library.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>'s 4K microLED displays, the Quest 3 has two 2K LCD panels. It also weighs in at 515 grams, while the Vision Pro weighs 600 to 650 grams depending on the Light Seal combination used, and the Quest does not have a separate battery pack.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg-comments/">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Again Disparages Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-again-disparages-apple-vision-pro.2421672/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today held a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-03-11/apple-car-canceled--live-q-a-with-bloomberg-s-mark-gurman">Q&A session focused on the Apple Car</a>, in which he revealed that the vehicle's chip would have been equivalent to four M2 Ultra chips combined. He also said the vehicle had an underlying "safetyOS" system that was one part of the overall operating system, but he did not elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
Gurman also briefly touched on a few other topics, including that Apple apparently "just started formal development" of a new MacBook Pro with an M4 chip. He did not provide any additional details about the chip, which has yet to be announced by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the M1 chip for Macs in November 2020, followed by the M2 chip in June 2022 and the M3 chip towards the end of October 2023, so there has been around a year-and-a-half gap between each of the chips being introduced. If that pattern continues, the M4 chip would be released in the first half of 2025. However, a late 2024 release is also possible if the interval shrinks to one year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last updated the MacBook Pro lineup in October with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips. As part of that refresh, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> and replaced it with a new base model 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip. Apple has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-imac-with-m3-chip/">updated the iMac</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">and MacBook Air</a> with the M3 chip, leaving the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro as the only current-generation Macs still equipped with the M2 family of chips.<br/>

Apple's chipmaking partner TSMC is expected to begin volume production of chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-designing-2nm-silicon-chips/">based on its 2nm process</a> in the second half of 2025, so the M4 chip will likely remain 3nm like the M3 chip. However, the M4 chip will likely be manufactured with an enhanced version of TSMC's 3nm process for improved performance and power efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, the Taiwanese publication <em>Economic Daily News</em> reported that the M4 chip will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">feature an upgraded Neural Engine</a> with "significantly" more cores for artificial intelligence tasks, but no other specific details are known about the chip at this time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macs/">M4 Macs</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-reportedly-developing-m4-macbook-pro/">Apple Reportedly &#039;Just Started Formal Development&#039; of M4 MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-just-started-formal-development-of-m4-macbook-pro.2421664/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently started distributing internal builds of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> to factories and relevant vendors, according to credible information shared on X by a private account with a track record of sharing accurate details on Apple's plans. The version of iOS that Apple provides at this stage is called "VendorUI," and access to it is strictly controlled. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909207" /><br/>
Sent out on an annual basis, VendorUI is a variant of iOS that is provided to factories for quality control testing. Because it has a pre-production version of the iOS user interface that Apple won't publicly unveil until WWDC, Apple is careful about where it is distributed. VendorUI can include references to new features, new settings or changes in branding. Unlike the versions of iOS used by Apple's software engineers, VendorUI often has certain apps omitted, ensuring that only the apps necessary for testing are present.<br/>
<br/>
With every iOS release, Apple develops several different versions of iOS:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Release</strong> – Stock iOS intended for end-consumers.<br/>
<li><strong>InternalUI</strong> – Created for Apple's software engineers, often contains pre-production version of the iOS user interface, with unreleased and unannounced features.<br/>
<li><strong>VendorUI</strong> – Designed for quality control testing in factories and can contain elements of pre-production iOS user interface.<br/>
<li><strong>NonUI</strong> – Developed for hardware engineers and calibration machines, does not feature the standard iOS user interface.<br/>
<li><strong>LLDiags</strong> – Intended for use in low-level diagnostics and has no user interface at all except for a simple diagnostics menu (Diags). <br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The distribution of the VendorUI version of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; means that we could soon start seeing more iOS features leak because the operating system is available to a larger number of people.<br/>
<br/>
Even without VendorUI, information about iOS has started to come out. We've heard that &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will have a heavy focus on AI, and there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/">will be new Accessibility features</a>, such as Adaptive Voice Shortcuts and Live Speech Categories. Internal versions of iOS can also contain hardware information, and back in December, we shared details <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/ios-18-code-four-new-iphone-models/">on the iPhone 16 hardware</a> sourced from &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; code.<br/>

		<title>iOS 18 and macOS 15 to Include Updated Freeform App With &#039;Scenes&#039; Feature</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and macOS 15, Apple intends to introduce a plethora of new features and enhancements affecting system applications and settings. Through industry sources, <em>MacRumors</em> has received details about the updated version of the Freeform app, which is set to include an interesting addition.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/Freeform-App-Icon.png" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-873728" /><br/>
Known as "Freeform Scenes," the new feature will give users the option to select specific sections or "Scenes" within their boards for easier navigation. Once selected and named, users will have the ability to easily return to them after viewing other areas of the board. Users will have the option to edit scenes after the fact as well, and will even be able to collaborate with others in doing so. Our sources claim that Freeform Scenes will be compatible with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, allowing for easier sharing and editing. <br/>
<br/>
The controls for the Freeform Scenes UI will be located near the zoom controls, towards the bottom left area within the app. Users will see a new sandwich-bar type icon with three vertical lines, and tapping or clicking the icon will show the Scenes UI. The Scenes UI includes a bar with individual arrow icons for easier navigation between Scenes, along with a square icon between the two arrows. Clicking or tapping the square icon will present the user with additional options to select or navigate between scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also developed the following keyboard shortcuts for Freeform Scenes:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Save</strong> – Shift + Command + S<br/>
<li><strong>Next Scene</strong> - Option + Command + ]<br/>
<li><strong>Previous Scene</strong> – Option + Command + [<br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Although this feature is in testing, it is worth noting that not all features make it to release, and Apple also sometimes delays new additions until a later version of iOS. While Freeform Scenes is in development for &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and macOS 18, it could be pulled or introduced at a later date. <br/>

Most products are in stock and ready to ship out today, and OWC offers free shipping on orders &#36;149.00 and over.<br/>

Look for that new hardware around the end of March or in April, as that's when the accompanying iPadOS 17.4 software should be ready to go.</blockquote>The following iPad-related announcements are expected in the March-April window:<ul><li>Two new iPad Pro models with the M3 chip, OLED displays, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">thinner enclosure</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, a redesigned rear camera bump and other design tweaks, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">possibly MagSafe wireless charging</a></li><br/>
<li>Two new iPad Air models with the M2 chip and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, including a first-ever 12.9-inch model</li><br/>
<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro with a larger trackpad, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">a partially-aluminum enclosure</a>, and other design tweaks</li><br/>
<li>A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/">new Apple Pencil</a></li></ul>Gurman previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">ruled out an Apple Event for the new iPads</a>. Instead, the devices will likely be announced in a press release on the Apple Newsroom website, like the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">were last week</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/">Gurman: New iPads to Launch Towards &#039;End of March&#039; or April</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-new-ipads-to-launch-towards-end-of-march-or-april.2421643/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
