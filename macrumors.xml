		<description><![CDATA[The Philips Hue app was today updated to version 5.14, adding support for widgets. Hue widgets can be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, Lock Screen, or Today View, and can be used for controlling lights and other accessories.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/philips-hue-app-widget.jpg" alt="" width="3084" height="1735" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944563" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> come in small, medium, and large sizes with the largest widget supporting eight actions or scenes. &zwnj;Widgets&zwnj; can be tailored to the entire Hue bridge or to lights that are located in specific rooms, so you can set up a widget for each of your rooms if desired.<br/>
<br/>
Each of the actions can be customized, and you can choose a scene from the Hue app or opt to turn lights in certain rooms on or off. Dimming lights is not an option, nor is activating automations, but some of that can be done through scenes. Adding a widget is a useful way to control frequently accessed lights or scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Along with widgets, the update also improves Friends of Hue switches like the Lutron Aurora Smart Bulb Dimmer Switch. Switches now support time-based light, the scene cycle mode, the natural light scene, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The Philips Hue app can be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/philips-hue/id1055281310">downloaded from the App Store</a> for free. It is designed to work with <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us">Philips Hue lights</a> and accessories.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/">Philips Hue</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/philips-hue-app-widgets/">Philips Hue App Gains Support for Widgets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-app-gains-support-for-widgets.2423410/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to release a new version of the Beats Solo 4 headphones, and hints of the refresh have been seen in both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-working-on-beats-solo-4-headphones/">iOS updates</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-beats-solo-4-headphones/">FCC filings</a> in recent weeks. We've already seen the design and some of the features, with rumors pointing to support for Spatial Audio, but the headphones' full specs were today shared by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/02/beats-solo4-specs/">9to5Mac</a></em> ahead of launch.<br/>

 	<li>3.5mm port will still be available for lossless audio.</li><br/>
 	<li>50 hours of playback time, up 10 hours from the Beats Solo 3.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced a new firmware update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A325, up from the 6A324 firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-releases-6a324-firmware-for-airpods-max/">released in January</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new, and the notes often only list generic bug fixes. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade the software on the AirPods, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are powered on and connected to an iOS device or a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ Max‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌AirPods to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first beta of iOS 17.5 to developers, and as expected, the update introduces support for downloading apps from developer websites in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-933094" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" /><br/>
In iOS 17.4, Apple began allowing developers to offer their apps through alternative app marketplaces in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act. Apple initially intended for apps to only be available through these marketplaces, but in March, Apple said that it would in fact be adding support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">downloading apps directly from websites</a>.<br/>
<br/>
To offer an app for download from a website in the European Union, developers need to meet specific criteria. Developers need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and must have an app with more than one million first installs on iOS in the European Union in the prior year. Other requirements include submitting to Apple's notarization process and publishing transparent data collection policies.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will provide authorized developers with an API that allows them to offer their apps for download via the web. Apps downloaded this way will be able to be backed up, restored, updated, and more.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time that Apple has sanctioned downloading an app directly from a website. Support for this feature will allow apps like Spotify, Fortnite, and others to be downloaded directly on iPhones should the developers behind those apps opt in to Apple's terms.<br/>
<br/>
Apps offered through the web do not have to pay any commission to Apple, but they are subject to the 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee.<br/>
<br/>
As with alternative app marketplaces, app downloads from the web are available in the European Union only under the terms of the DMA. Note that apps can only be downloaded this way on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as the changes do not apply to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/ios-17-5-app-website-downloads-eu/">iOS 17.5 Lets EU iPhone Users Download Apps From Websites</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-5-lets-eu-iphone-users-download-apps-from-websites.2423395/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.5 update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.5 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a month after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-tvos-17-4/">release of tvOS 17.4</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/apple-tv-4k-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856182" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.5 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-tvos-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Beta of tvOS 17.5 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-tvos-17-5-to-developers.2423391/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new version of the popular Beats Solo on-ear headphones, and it looks like we are getting closer to a potential launch date. FCC documents for the Beats Solo 4 headphones were found today, and that typically happens in the weeks ahead of a debut. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/new-beats-solo-4.jpg" alt="" width="1129" height="635" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938522" /><br/>
Signs of the Beats Solo 4 were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-working-on-beats-solo-4-headphones/">first spotted in late February</a>, with images found in the iOS 17.4 beta. The headphones look similar to the Solo 3 headphones, but with some minor design tweaks that bring them in line with the Beats Studio Pro that came out last year. <br/>
<br/>
We are expecting the Beats Solo 4 to come in three colors, including black, pink, and blue. While we don't know the full feature set, we found code that suggests they will support Spatial Audio. <br/>
<br/>
The headphones are likely to adopt some of the changes that were brought to the Beats Studio Pro, including improved sound quality and a USB-C port instead of a micro-USB port. Gesture support will be included, with a press on the "b" button to play/pause and answer calls, a double press to skip songs, and a long press to activate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Beats Solo 3 headphones first came out in 2016, and while there have been new color releases, the line is long overdue for an update. There is no word as of yet when the Solo 4 will come out, but FCC filings usually show up around a month in advance. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-beats-solo-4-headphones/">New Beats Solo 4 Headphones Show Up in FCC Database as Launch Approaches</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-beats-solo-4-headphones-show-up-in-fcc-database-as-launch-approaches.2423381/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<category>iOS 18</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[A first look at iOS 18's rumored visionOS-style redesign may have been revealed by a new image of the Camera app.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Camera-App-Possible-Leak-16x9-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-944500" /><em>Alleged iOS 18 design resource.</em></div><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> received the above iPhone frame template from an anonymous source who claims they obtained it from an iOS engineer. It will allegedly be included as part of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/">Apple Design Resources</a> for iOS 18, which helps developers visually design apps using software like Sketch and Photoshop. We cannot attest to the authenticity of the image, but believe it is worth sharing because it is consistent with previous rumors.<br/>
<br/>
In February, Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em> claimed that iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">visionOS-inspired design elements</a>. The Vision Pro headset's OS features a high level of depth translucency with glass-like buttons that have reflective edges. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-design.jpeg" alt="" width="1800" height="1012" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935810" /><em>visionOS design elements.</em></div><br/>
<br/>
For example, the Apple TV app on iPadOS 18 will apparently feature the same translucent navigation bar that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">introduced in the tvOS 17.2 version of the app</a> last year. The design of this menu has clear similarities to visionOS. Apple also plans to redesign various other system menus and built-in apps on iOS 18, including Safari, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Verifier</em> has a mixed track record with Apple rumors over the years, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman subsequently said that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">working to update the design of iOS</a> as "early as this year." He agreed that iOS could take some design cues from visionOS going forward, but Gurman does not expect a "total overhaul that mirrors visionOS." The extent of the potential redesign is therefore still unknown.<br/>
<br/>
While Gurman implied that the redesign may not emerge this year, he was more firm about iOS 18 being redesigned in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-12/apple-aapl-plans-ambitious-ios-18-and-macos-15-updates-seeks-to-squash-bugs-lovjlsf6">November edition</a> of his newsletter, when he said Apple's senior management had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">described iOS 18 as "ambitious and compelling,"</a> with "major new features and designs."<br/>
<br/>
The purported iOS 18 Camera app design resource seemingly lines up with these reports, showing a substantial rethinking of Apple's visual elements in line with visionOS, but it may not be legitimate. Apple is expected to preview iOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC on June 10. The first beta should be available shortly after the announcement. The update should be released to all users in September alongside the iPhone 16 lineup.

This is one of the few times in 2024 the AirPods 2 have dropped below their typical &#36;99.00 deal price, so if you've been waiting to purchase now is a good time.<br/>

<br/>
The AirPods 2 feature Apple's H1 chip, providing seamless setup for iPhone and other Apple devices. They lack some of the more advanced features of the newer AirPods 3 and updated AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, but for anyone who just needs a reliable pair of wireless earbuds, they're perfect at this low price.<br/>

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/vision-pro-spatial-personas/">previewed Spatial Personas</a> at WWDC last year. Unlike the existing Personas feature, which is confined to a tile and facial expressions only, Spatial Personas allow Vision Pro users to "break out of the familiar <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> tile and feel more present, like they are gathered in the same physical space." They feature a transparent background and are able to show body language and additional movement such as hand gestures for a more lifelike experience.<br/>

<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I tried Spatial Persona on Apple Vision Pro yesterday.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Beats brand is known for participating in collaborations with various designers and others for special editions of Beats earphones and headphones, and the latest partnership is with luxury activewear brand Alo Yoga for a unique version of Beats Fit Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/beats-fit-pro-alo-yoga.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943440" /><br/>
The Beats x Alo Special Edition Beats Fit Pro come in a standard matte black color but with pearlized Beats "b" logos on both earbuds and a debossed Alo logo on the right earbud. The case is where the unique design is more immediately apparent, as it features a high-gloss coating with shimmering sparkles on the exterior and a reflective chrome-like finish with Beats and Alo logos on the interior of the lid.<blockquote>"The Beats x Alo collaboration felt truly predestined as both Los Angeles hometown brands have made a lasting impact on fitness and culture," said Chris Thorne, Beats CMO. "Beats and Alo have a shared passion for high-performance products that allow our customers to express their unique and distinct personalities. We're thrilled to join forces with Alo and bring the perfect tech accessory to the world of fitness."</blockquote>As part of a marketing campaign for the special edition earphones, Beats and Alo worked with Grammy Award-winning artist Tyla to feature her recent track "Safer." Tyla will participate in a <a href="https://apple.co/Tyla">conversation with Apple Music host Nadeska Alexis</a> at Apple SoHo in New York City on April 4 at 6:00 pm as part of a Today at Apple series on the intersection of music and wellness.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming watchOS 11 update will drop support for 2018's Apple Watch Series 4, according to <em><a href="https://iphonesoft.fr/2024/03/30/apple-watch-compatibles-watchos-11">iPhoneSoft</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/09/apple-watch-series-4-flames.jpg" alt="" width="1130" height="634" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-655494" /><br/>
After five years of receiving the latest software updates, Apple Watch Series 3 lost support upon the release of watchOS 9 in 2022. Last year's watchOS 10 update was compatible with all of the same Apple Watch models as watchOS 9, but a new rumor claims that watchOS 11 will drop support for the oldest currently supported Apple smartwatch: the Apple Watch Series 4. The full device compatibility list for watchOS 11 is said to be as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li>Apple Watch Series 5 (2019)</li><br/>
	<li>Apple Watch Series 6 (2020)</li><br/>
	<li>Apple Watch Series 7 (2021)</li><br/>
	<li>Apple Watch Series 8 (2022)</li><br/>
	<li>Apple Watch Series 9 (2023)</li><br/>
	<li>Apple Watch SE (first generation, 2020)</li><br/>
	<li>Apple Watch SE (second generation, 2022)</li><br/>
	<li>Apple Watch Ultra (first generation, 2022)</li><br/>
	<li>Apple Watch Ultra 2 (2023)</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 4 debuted alongside the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in 2018, introducing the device's first ever redesign, a larger display, double the amount of storage, Fall Detection, and the ability to take an ECG.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, iOS 17 dropped support for the iPhone X, but iOS 18 is rumored to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ios-18-compatible-iphones-rumor/">support all of the same models</a> as its predecessor. Apple is expected to preview watchOS 11, iOS 18, and its other next-generation software updates at WWDC on June 10. The updates will likely release to the public in the fall. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/watchos-11-to-drop-support-for-series-4/">watchOS 11 Rumored to Drop Support for Apple Watch Series 4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-rumored-to-drop-support-for-apple-watch-series-4.2423361/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Researchers Reveal New AI System That Can Beat GPT-4</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple researchers have developed an artificial intelligence system named ReALM (Reference Resolution as Language Modeling) that aims to radically enhance how voice assistants understand and respond to commands.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840591" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20329">research paper</a> (via <em><a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/apple-researchers-develop-ai-that-can-see-and-understand-screen-context/">VentureBeat</a></em>), Apple outlines a new system for how large language models tackle reference resolution, which involves deciphering ambiguous references to on-screen entities, as well as understanding conversational and background context. As a result, ReALM could lead to more intuitive and natural interactions with devices.<br/>
<br/>
Reference resolution is an important part of natural language understanding, enabling users to use pronouns and other indirect references in conversation without confusion. For digital assistants, this capability has historically been a significant challenge, limited by the need to interpret a wide range of verbal cues and visual information. Apple's ReALM system seeks to address this by converting the complex process of reference resolution into a pure language modeling problem. In doing so, it can comprehend references to visual elements displayed on a screen and integrate this understanding into the conversational flow.<br/>
<br/>
ReALM reconstructs the visual layout of a screen using textual representations. This involves parsing on-screen entities and their locations to generate a textual format that captures the screen's content and structure. Apple researchers found that this strategy, combined with specific fine-tuning of language models for reference resolution tasks, significantly outperforms traditional methods, including the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4.<br/>
<br/>
ReALM could enable users to interact with digital assistants much more efficiently with reference to what is currently displayed on their screen without the need for precise, detailed instructions. This has the potential to make voice assistants much more useful in a variety of settings, such as helping drivers navigate infotainment systems while driving or assisting users with disabilities by providing an easier and more accurate means of indirect interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has now published several AI research papers. Last month, the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-mm1-ai-model-details/">revealed a new method</a> for training large language models that seamlessly integrates both text and visual information. Apple is widely expected to unveil an array of AI features at WWDC in June.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-reveals-new-ai-system/">Apple Researchers Reveal New AI System That Can Beat GPT-4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-researchers-reveal-new-ai-system-that-can-beat-gpt-4.2423356/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cases purportedly designed for the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> have emerged online, further corroborating rumors that the device will feature a complete redesign to bring it in line with 2022's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iphone-se-4-case.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-944460" /><br/>
Screenshots of a video <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1774024470107210169">shared on X</a> by the leaker known as "Majin Bu" validate reports that the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14-like all-screen design with a notch housing a TrueDepth camera array for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, but with a single rear camera module like the current model. The images show a soft gel case around an aluminum mold engraved with the text "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE4." The current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; has an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8-like design with large top and bottom bezels, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> Home button. <br/>
<br/>
Last year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/"><em>MacRumors</em> revealed</a> that the next-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; would largely re-use the design of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, including &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; authentication and a 6.1-inch OLED display, but with a single rear camera, an Action button, and a USB-C port. The new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is not expected to launch until 2025, but there have been an unusually large number of reports about its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/">specific features</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/iphone-se-4-design-revealed-in-cad-renders/">design elements</a> in recent months.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-4/">iPhone SE 4</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/iphone-se-4-case-corroborates-design-rumors/">iPhone SE 4 Case Corroborates iPhone 14-Like Design Rumors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-case-corroborates-iphone-14-like-design-rumors.2423350/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple favors podcasts in its "Browse" tab that participate in its subscriptions program, according to <em><a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/31/2024/apple-muscles-in-on-subscription-podcasts">Semafor</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Podcasts-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-798617" /><br/>
To be featured at the top of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a>' Browse tab, creators simply have to submit a form to Apple, but the report noted that, last week, five of the first seven shows in the "Browse" carousel in the &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; app were participants in &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; Subscriptions. <br/>
<br/>
Apple launched podcast subscriptions in 2021, allowing creators to offer premium content to their audience, such as bonus episodes and exclusive segments, in exchange for a small subscription fee. Apple, in return, takes up to a 30 percent cut of the revenue generated from these subscriptions. <br/>
<br/>
One executive at an independent podcast told <em>Semafor</em> that Apple explicitly said to them that podcast subscription enrolment would help their chances of being promoted in the carousel, while another remarked that &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; Subscriptions was worth participating in simply for in-app placement advantages. An individual at Apple added that the &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; app is now designed to offer more features to shows that participate in the subscription program, with several key slots reserved for this purpose.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts-subscriptions/">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-podcasts-favors-subscription-shows/">Report: Apple Podcasts Favors Shows With Subscriptions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-podcasts-favors-shows-with-subscriptions.2423348/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
