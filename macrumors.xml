		<description><![CDATA[Apple TV+ is currently available at a much lower price than usual, but time is running out if you want to take advantage of the offer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-TV-Plus-Feature-2-Magenta-and-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959290" /><br/>
In the U.S., new and qualified returning customers can subscribe to Apple TV+ for just &#36;2.99 per month, for three months. Afterwards, regular pricing of &#36;9.99 per month applies. The offer is available in the Apple TV app, and at <a href="http://tv.apple.com/">tv.apple.com</a>, through April 24. Unfortunately, existing subscribers are not eligible to receive the discount.<br/>
<br/>
The promotion is running in other countries, too. In Canada, for example, the special price is set at &#36;3.99 per month. In the U.K., it is set at Â£2.99.<br/>
<br/>
With an Apple TV+ subscription, you can watch all of Apple's original shows and films. You can also watch select MLB and MLS games with weekly Friday Night Baseball and Sunday Night Soccer doubleheaders, at no additional cost.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/18/apple-tv-plus-lower-price-offer/">Apple TV+ Available at Significantly Lower Price Until Next Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-available-at-significantly-lower-price-until-next-week.2455592/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just in time for the start of the NBA and NHL playoffs this weekend, the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-sports/id6446788829">Apple Sports app</a> has received a new Game Card Sharing feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Apple-Sports-Game-Card-Sharing.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999242" /><br/>
With this feature, Apple Sports users can generate and share game cards for all supported leagues, whether the matchup is upcoming, live, or completed. The game cards can be shared via iMessage, on social media, and elsewhere. In addition to the NBA and NHL, the feature will be available for MLB, MLS, Formula 1, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's example screenshots show a game card for the recent Memphis Grizzlies vs. Golden State Warriors play-in game, complete with the final score.<br/>
<br/>
The feature is available starting today, with no app update required.<br/>
<br/>
Launched in February 2024, the Apple Sports app shows scores, stats, standings, upcoming games, and more for a variety of leagues. The free app is currently available on the iPhone only, in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-sports/">Apple Sports</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/18/apple-sports-app-game-card-sharing/">Apple Sports App Now Lets You Share Game Cards via iMessage and Social Media</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sports-app-now-lets-you-share-game-cards-via-imessage-and-social-media.2455586/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Daring Fireball</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/john-gruber/">John Gruber</a> joins us on this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/john-gruber-talks-apple-intelligence-controversy-and/id1602394741?i=1000704009899">The MacRumors Show</a> to discuss <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> and the future of the company.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6g4QZ9hKzog?si=uajKbn6yAoS2Q0ZI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
We talk through the reaction to John's influential "<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a>" piece on <em>Daring Fireball</em>, which pointed out that Apple's credibility has been "damaged" by the delay in releasing key &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features such as personalized <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chaos-behind-siri-revealed/">Subsequent reports</a> revealed that Vision Pro chief Mike Rockwell has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/">taken over the Siri team</a> at Apple, which until recently was led by artificial intelligence chief John Giannandrea. Software chief Craig Federighi is also believed to have taken on more responsibility to turn &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; around.<br/>
<br/>
The company has altered its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-abruptly-changes-marketing-materials/">marketing strategy</a> away from the "Hello, &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;" tagline and the features are finally expected to launch sometime within the next year. With this recent context, we get John's thoughts on how the situation has evolved since he wrote his article, including on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/apple-hit-with-more-siri-delay-lawsuits/">proposed class-action lawsuits</a> against Apple over false advertising. We also look at how Apple may present its suite of AI features at WWDC later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, we reflect on the Vision Pro almost two years after its announcement, and John explains why he believes that the headset avoided the mismanagement that has mired apple Intelligence. We also talk through rumors about the second-generation Vision Pro headset that is expected to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/vision-pro-2-now-in-production/">between fall 2025 and spring 2026</a> as a minor spec bump, simply upgrading from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> to the M5 chip. We also explore the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/">lower-cost Vision headset</a>, dubbed "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-vision-air-rumored-with-new-design/">Vision Air</a>," and how this could be positioned when it launches.<br/>
<br/>
We look at the state of Apple's smart home proposition and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> amid rumors that the company's first smart home hub product has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-smart-home-hub-postponed/">delayed to 2026</a>. The device is believed to be finished and was originally scheduled to launch in March 2025, but due to its reliance on &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; its release has reportedly been shelved until next year.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we discuss the long-rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">foldable iPhone</a>, pondering on what Apple is likely to do differently when it launches the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/">next year</a>. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> also has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix is testing a new search feature powered by OpenAI technology that aims to improve how users discover content on the streaming platform, according to multiple reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-4.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884794" /><br/>
The new AI-powered search capability will allow subscribers to use more natural language queries beyond traditional searches for genres or actors. Users will be able to search for content based on more specific criteria, including their mood, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-11/netflix-tests-new-ai-search-engine-to-recommend-shows-movies">Bloomberg</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix spokesperson MoMo Zhou confirmed to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647518/netflix-openai-search-beta-test-ios">The Verge</a></em> that the feature is currently being tested with select users in Australia and New Zealand on iOS devices. Zhou added that the test will expand to the United States "in the coming weeks and months," although there are currently no plans to extend the feature beyond iOS.<br/>
<br/>
During Netflix's first-quarter earnings call, CEO Greg Peters spoke about the importance of improving content discovery on the platform.<br/>
<br/>
"There is more room to improve the discovery and recommendation experience, and therefore provide more value for members, and therefore find the biggest audiences for our titles," Peters said.<br/>
<br/>
The new search functionality is opt-in for users, suggesting Netflix is taking a cautious approach with its latest AI feature-in-testing. "It's early days for the feature and we're really in a learn and listen phase for this beta," Zhou said.<br/>
<br/>
AI search comes alongside other user experience improvements, including a redesign of Netflix's TV app homepage â the first major structural change to the interface in over a decade, according to Peters. The company plans to roll out the redesign later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix has employed AI and machine learning for its recommendation algorithms in the past, but this new search function will be an expansion of the company's use of generative AI technology.<br/>
<br/>
Co-CEO Ted Sarandos has previously stated that AI will help improve filmmaking, but it won't replace creative personnel like screenwriters and actors. It's a sensitive topic in Hollywood where many have expressed concerns about AI potentially cutting jobs and reducing costs.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix reported a 12.5% increase in first-quarter revenue, reaching &#36;10.54 billion compared to the same period last year.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/18/netflix-ai-search-feature-openai-discovery/">Netflix&#039;s New AI Search Feature Will Understand Your Viewing Moods</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflixs-new-ai-search-feature-will-understand-your-viewing-moods.2455573/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Despite being more than two years old, Apple's AirPodsÂ ProÂ 2 still dominate the premium wirelessâearbud space, thanks to a potent mix of topâtier audio, classâleading noise cancellation, and Apple's habit of delivering major new features through software updates. With AirPodsÂ ProÂ 3 widely expected to arrive in 2025, prospective buyers now face a familiar dilemma: snap up the proven <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>Â 2 at today's prices, or hold off for the nextâgeneration model that could raise the bar once again.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/AirPods-Pro-3-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-999276" /><br/>
Apart from their sonic strengths, the enduring popularity of AirPodsâ¯Proâ¯2 owes much to Apple's ongoing feature rollouts. iOSâ¯17 (2023) introduced Adaptiveâ¯Audio, mute controls, and faster device switching. iOSâ¯18 (2024) followed up with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-airpods-pro/">headâgesture Siri commands</a>, Voice Isolation, finer Adaptiveâ¯Audio sliders, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-airpods-pro/">Personalized Spatial Audio mode</a> for gamers. Apple then used iOSâ¯18.1 and iOSâ¯18.2 to add <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/12/airpods-pro-2-hearing-aid-fda-authorization/">FDAâauthorized</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/airpods-pro-2-to-gain-new-hearing-features/">hearingâaid functionality</a> in supported regions, letting &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;â¯2 double as overâtheâcounter hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>2025 AirPodsâ¯Pro: What the Rumors Say</h2><br/>
<h3>Design and Case Tweaks</h3><br/>
Every credible report agrees that AirPodsâ¯Proâ¯3 will inherit today's software feature set, but hardware refinements are also expected. Multiple supplyâchain sources point to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/airpods-lineup-overhaul-2024/">refreshed look for both the buds and the case</a>, with rumors of a slimmer form factor, a concealed status LED, and a frontâfacing capacitive pairing button â an approach taken for Apple's fourthâgeneration AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Audio Processor and ANC Upgrades</h3><br/>
Under the hood, Apple is said to be testing a faster audio chip that drives <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/airpods-pro-3-much-better-anc-rumor/">"much better" Active Noise Cancellation</a> than the alreadyâimpressive &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;â¯2 manage. That bump will be crucial if Apple hopes to stay ahead of rivals like Sony's WFâ1000XM5 and Bose's QuietComfort Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Health Sensors: HeartâRate Monitoring</h3><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Markâ¯Gurman, Apple is developing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/airpods-pro-3-heart-rate-feature-rumor/">inâear heartârate tracking</a> for &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;â¯3. The company's recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-announced/">Powerbeatsâ¯Proâ¯2</a> already capture heart data during workouts but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/powebeats-pro-hr-tracking-gym-equipment-no-music/">cannot stream music to gym equipment simultaneously</a>. Apple will need to nail seamless audio playback alongside biometric reporting if &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;â¯3 are to satisfy fitnessâfocused users.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>InâEar Temperature Detection</h3><br/>
Apple is also researching earâcanal temperature sensing, which â if it ships â could offer faster, more reliable bodyâtemperature readings than the skinâtemperature estimates produced by Appleâ¯Watch Seriesâ¯8 and later. Whether the sensor will be productionâready in time for a 2025 release remains unclear.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>OnâDevice Live Translation</h3><br/>
One rumor claims &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;â¯3 will partner with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s Translate app to deliver <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/airpods-live-translation-ios-19/">realâtime conversation translation</a> directly through the earbuds. Imagine an English speaker hearing an instant English rendition of a Spanish counterpart's words (and vice versa) without fumbling with handheld devices. Implementation details are still thin, but the idea fits in with Apple's broader AI push.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2><br/>
Longerâterm, analyst MingâChiâ¯Kuo believes Apple is prototyping <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/">AirPods with infrared cameras</a> to enhance spatialâaudio experiences, while Gurman has heard of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-still-exploring-airpods-with-cameras/">small cameras being explored</a> for AIâdriven features. The infrared cameras could potentially enable "in-air gesture control" as well, allowing for device interaction with hand movements. Both projects are said to be high priority inside Apple, but neither is likely to debut before 2026.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPodsâ¯4 Hints</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/02/airpods-4-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964768" /\><br/>
The fourthâgeneration AirPods offer useful clues to Apple's design cues for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>. Apple has replaced the rear setup button with a hidden capacitive sensor under the status light on the case front, and the LED itself now disappears when inactive. These stealth touches make for Apple's smallest and lightest charging case yet, and it is hard to imagine the company not extending them to the Pro line.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Release Date</h2><br/>
Gurman's most recent guidance places AirPodsâ¯Proâ¯3 in 2025, or only "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/airpods-with-heart-rate-monitoring-months-away/">months away</a>" as of February. A lone leaker has floated a <a href="https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1893959582344430024">May or June unveiling</a>, but the same source made a similar claim in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/airpods-pro-3-much-better-anc-rumor/">Augustâ¯2024</a> that failed to materialize. Historically, Apple has launched significant AirPods updates alongside new iPhones, so a September event, likely shared with the upcoming &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;â¯17 series, remains the most plausible window.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Summing Up</h2><br/>
With AirPodsâ¯Proâ¯3 potentially arriving in roughly five months, Apple device users face a choice. AirPodsâ¯4 put Active Noise Cancellation within reach at &#36;179, while AirPodsâ¯Proâ¯2 continue to satisfy with topâtier sound, proven ANC, and hearingâaid mode. But if heartârate tracking, live translation, and even better ANC sound appealing, AirPodsâ¯Proâ¯3 promise the biggest leap since the original Pros, and hopefully without raising the &#36;249 price tag. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/18/airpods-pro-3-upgrades-worth-waiting-for/">AirPodsÂ ProÂ 3 Just Months Away â Here&#039;s What We Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpodsÂ proÂ 3-just-months-away-â-heres-what-we-know.2455572/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone shipments in China declined by 9 percent in the first quarter compared to the year earlier, and it was the only major smartphone vendor to see a decline, according to data from <a href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53329125">research firm IDC</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iPhone-16-Apple-Store-Levels.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976828" /><br/>
Shipments of iPhones fell to 9.8 million units, giving Apple a market share of 13.7 percent, down from 17.4 percent in the previous quarter. Apple has now had seven straight quarters of decline.<br/>
<br/>
For local vendors, it was another story. Market leader Xiaomi saw shipments rise 40 percent to 13.3 million units. Meanwhile, industry-wide shipments rose by 3.3 percent.<br/>
<br/>
According to IDC, Apple's premium pricing structure prevented the company from capitalizing on new government subsidies introduced at the start of the year that fuelled growth in the first quarter.<br/>
<br/>

Under the subsidies, consumers of electronics get a 15 percent refund of products that are priced under 6,000 yuan (&#36;820).

High-speed data worldwide is capped at 15GB per month, and after that, speeds are limited to 1.5Mb/s.<br/>
<br/>
Verizon's Unlimited Ultimate plan is &#36;100 per month, but it drops to &#36;90 per month with Auto Pay enabled. It offers 5G UWB data, up to 4K video streaming, 50 percent off data plans for a watch and tablet, and talk, text, and unlimited data in Mexico and Canada.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Instagram today announced the launch of Blend, a new feature that's designed to allow users to connect to their friends in new ways over DMs. Blend is essentially a shared feed of Reels that combines recommendations that users and their friends might like.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Instagram-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786417" /><br/>
To start a Blend with a friend or a group of friends, users can go to a DM and then tap on the Blend icon. From there, everyone in the DM group is able to participate.<br/>
<br/>
The Blend will include Reels that users in the group are interested in, based on what they've browsed individually and what's been shared in the DM thread. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIjbqOGqjse/">Instagram chief Adam Mosseri</a> said that it's a way for users to share their interests with their friends, and to start new conversations.<br/>
<br/>
Blend feeds will refresh with new content each day as a way to keep participants coming back to the conversation. Every chat can have a unique Blend with different participants.<br/>
<br/>
Instagram has been testing Blend with a small group of Instagram users since March, but it is now rolling out more widely.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/instagram-blend-shared-reels/">Instagram Announces &#039;Blend&#039; Shared Reel Feeds</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-announces-blend-shared-reel-feeds.2455553/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When U.S. President Donald Trump levied 145 percent tariffs on goods imported from China, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> started working to score Apple an exemption that would keep <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> costs down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990894" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/17/apple-iphone-tariff-exemption-trump/">The Washington Post</a></em>, Cook had a phone call with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week, explaining how the tariffs would cause &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; prices to increase. He talked to senior White House officials about the tariffs, and made sure not to say anything negative in public about Trump's policies that would anger Trump. For Trump's inauguration, Cook also personally donated &#36;1 million.<br/>
<br/>
Cook's efforts paid off, and last weekend, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/12/apple-tariff-exemptions/">the Trump administration exempted</a> the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Mac, Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and other electronics from the bulk of tariffs put in place on Chinese goods.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's tariff exemption could be temporary, however, as the day after the announcement, Trump said that there was "no tariff exception" and that no one would be "getting off the hook." Apple and other tech companies will be "moving to a different tariff bucket" as Trump and his administration will be "taking a look" at semiconductors and the electronics supply chain in planned National Security Tariff Investigations.<br/>
<br/>
With the on-again, off-again tariffs, Apple stock has fluctuated quite a bit over the course of the last few weeks. Stock was down as much as 20 percent, but it recovered some of its value after the exemption.<br/>
<br/>
During the first Trump administration, Cook was able to prevent tariffs from impacting Apple devices like the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the Apple Watch by convincing Trump that the fees would give South Korean company Samsung an edge over Apple.<br/>
<br/>
This time around, Trump has claimed he won't be pressured by companies into lowering tariffs. On Monday, though, he said that he "helped &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; recently," a sign that Cook has an in with Trump that could keep Apple from being hit hard by future tariffs.<br/>
<br/>
Trump insists that Apple could manufacture the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and other products in the United States, but there are significant barriers that would prevent Apple from doing so, including the cost of building factories, a lack of skilled laborers, and the cost of paying U.S. workers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has pledged a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/apple-announces-500b-us-investment-plan/">&#36;500 billion investment</a> in the United States, and it plans to manufacture Private Cloud Compute servers at a facility in Houston in partnership with Foxconn. Servers are a much lower volume product that isn't consumer facing, which makes them more feasible to assemble in the U.S.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/tim-cook-trump-apple-tariff-exemption/">How Apple CEO Tim Cook Convinced Trump to Exempt Apple From Tariffs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-apple-ceo-tim-cook-convinced-trump-to-exempt-apple-from-tariffs.2455550/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google has an illegal monopoly in online advertising, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said today. Google is guilty of "willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power" in the publisher ad server market that websites use for ads and the open-web display ad exchange market that matches advertisers with websites.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837104" /><br/>
Publishers that wanted to use Google's ad exchange were also required to use its ad server, which disadvantaged competing platforms. Google's "First Look" feature gave its ad exchange the first right of refusal for impressions, and "Last Look" let its platform assess bids from competitors before making its own bid.<br/>
<br/>
Google later rolled out Unified Pricing Rules limiting the pricing strategies that publishers used to reduce dependence on Google ads and screen out low-quality content, which the court says favored Google's ad tech growth while harming rival ad tech products. Google's scale and "vast repositories" of data about advertisers, publishers, and users limits competition.<br/>
<br/>
According to the court, Google's actions have resulted in significant harm to advertisers, publishers, and consumers.<br/>
<br/>
Google could be required to divest its publisher ad server and exchange products, make changes to how it operates to prevent anticompetitive practices in the future, and pay fines. The court plans to decide on appropriate remedies at a future hearing.<br/>
<br/>
Today's antitrust ruling comes as Google gears up to face off with the U.S. Department of Justice over its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/google-search-antitrust-monopoly/">online search monopoly</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 18.4, Apple added a new Shortcuts action to open a specific conversation in the Messages app. This means it's now possible to open a chat thread with someone important to you straight from your Lock Screen, for example. Keep reading to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/lock-screen-open-conversation-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-999256" /><br/>
If you'd like to reduce the time it takes to chat with a frequently contacted person, this new shortcut action is for you. Placing a shortcut on your Lock Screen to a spouse or family member's chat thread allows you to contact them without navigating through the app, making it perfect for quick updates, urgent communications, or daily check-ins.<br/>
<br/>
The feature also streamlines interactions by minimizing distractions, since it lets you bypass the Messages interface, so you won't be tempted to engage with other messages or notifications. It could be handy in situations where rapid access matters, such as emergencies or business communications. The following steps show you how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Create Your Shortcut Action</h2><br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the top-right corner of the app.</li><br/>
  <li>Start typing "Open Conversation" in the Search Actions input field, then select the action in the results.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap "Conversation" in blue, then select the Messages conversation you want from the dropdown.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> to finish.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/shortcut-open-conversation.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999134" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Add Shortcut to Your Lock Screen</h2><br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Long press your Lock Screen, tap <strong>Customize</strong> on the Lock Screen you want to use, then tap <strong>Lock Screen</strong> again.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap the minus symbol on one of the bottom buttons to remove the existing control.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap the plus symbol that replaces it, then select <strong>Shortcut</strong> from the Controls menu.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap "Choose" in blue, then select <strong>Open Conversation</strong> from the shortcuts menu.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> on the Lock Screen customize screen to finish.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/add-conversation-lock-screen.jpg" alt="Lock Screen" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999135" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. The "Open Conversation" is more versatile than you might think. For example, you could use it to add a neat shortcut to a particular chat thread on your Home Screen, or even pop one on your Control Center. Have a play around with it, and see what works for you.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/open-messages-conversation-from-iphone-lock-screen/">Open Your Favorite Messages Chat From Your iPhone Lock Screen</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/open-your-favorite-messages-chat-from-your-iphone-lock-screen.2455530/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The cables are available in a variety of colors and lengths, with USB-C to USB-C, USB-C to USB-A, and USB-C to Lightning options. All of the cables have a Beats logo, along with a woven design that increases durability and helps to prevent tangles. In the U.S., prices range from &#36;18.99 to &#36;34.99 for one to two cables.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, this is Apple's first own USB-C to USB-A cable, which could be popular for CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, there is nothing extraordinary about these cables, and many cheaper alternatives that are functionally equivalent are available on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
Beats has shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GtnMh38LuA">another ad for the cables</a> on its YouTube channel.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[More images of a redesigned power cable allegedly for a future Apple "Vision Air" headset were today shared online by the prototype collector and leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/vision-air-cable.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-999087" /><br/>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-vision-air-rumored-with-new-design/">the leaker explained</a> that the Apple "Vision Air" will feature a thinner design and switch the battery enclosure and several of its internal structures to titanium to reduce the device's overall weight. Most of the exterior of the device will continue to be aluminum, except with a "Midnight" bluish-black finish. Today's Vision Pro is only available in silver.<br/>
<br/>
The latest images of the power cable show an anodized aluminum connector finished in Apple's distinctive Midnight color. Initial pictures of the Lightning-style connector in Midnight purportedly for the next-generation Vision device were first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-vision-air-rumored-with-new-design/">shared yesterday</a>:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our next Vision <a href="https://t.co/VGAK9rNsrU">pic.twitter.com/VGAK9rNsrU</a></p>&mdash; Kosutami (@Kosutami_Ito) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1911069453170999702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro uses a similar connector, except with 12 pins instead of eight, suggesting that the new cable is part of a more significant redesign, at least of the external battery. The audio strap connector appears to be the same design as that of the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not the same size with OG lightning plug. It&#39;s wider than that <a href="https://t.co/LFEdV40fpB">pic.twitter.com/LFEdV40fpB</a></p>&mdash; Kosutami (@Kosutami_Ito) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1912518056087003253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to launch a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/vision-pro-2-now-in-production/">second-generation Vision Pro headset</a> with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/">M5 chip</a> between <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/vision-pro-2-now-in-production/">fall 2025 and spring 2026</a>, but the company's work on a lower-cost headset is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/">widely reported</a>. The latter could be the "Vision Air" device Kosutami has referred to.<br/>
<br/>
Kosutami has a mixed track record for Apple rumors, but they were the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/new-apple-watch-magnetic-band/">first to say</a> that Apple would replace its leather Modern Buckle band with a FineWoven version in 2023.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models simultaneously, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-models-1.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964745" /><br/>
If you skipped the iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 17 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for Apple's successor lineup, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released around mid-September.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">1. iPhone 17 "Air" </span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Plus?</span><br><br/>
Apple plans to launch an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">all-new iPhone 17 model</a> with a "significantly thinner" design, reports <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slim-iphone-17-top-center-cameras-rumor/">The Information</a></em>. The device, which could be called "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/slim-iphone-17-could-be-iphone-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>," will feature a "major redesign" that will feature a single rear camera located on a horizontal camera bar running along the top of the device, along with a narrower Dynamic Island, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 17 Air will be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, which likely means it will have a 5.5mm chassis with a thicker rear camera bump area. The device is rumored to have a 6.6-inch display size, and is likely to replace the Plus model in Apple's lineup. Other reported features include an aluminum chassis, an A19 chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">Apple's C1 modem</a>, an Action button, a Camera Control button, and a 24MP front camera. See our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">iPhone 17 "Slim" rumor roundup</a> for more.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    2. New All-Aluminum Design</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 17 Models</span><br><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/">reportedly</a> planning to bring all its devices back to aluminum with the iPhone 17 lineup. The two flagship iPhone 17 Pro models will mark the return of aluminum frames to high-end iPhones for the first time since Apple began distinguishing between Pro and non-Pro models. In recent years, aluminum frames have been reserved for lower-end devices like the iPhone SE and iPhone 16, while premium models featured stainless steel frames until the iPhone 15 Pro, which introduced a titanium chassis as a major upgrade. This shift in materials for the iPhone 17 lineup signals a unified approach, with aluminum frames set to return across the entire device range.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    3. Significantly Redesigned Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
This year's iPhone 17 Pro models will have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/iphone-17-pro-redesign-backed-by-supply-chain-info/">major redesign</a>, specifically centering around changes to the rear camera module. Apple will move away from the familiar square camera bump to a distinctive aluminum camera bar that spans the device's width, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/revealed-entire-iphone-17-lineups-camera-designs/">recent reports</a>. The camera area will be the same color as the rest of the device. The redesigned camera module is not expected to extend to the regular iPhone 17.<br/>
<br/>
The devices are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/">rumored</a> to feature a new rear design combining aluminum and glass. The top half of the back will be aluminum, incorporating a new camera bump made from aluminum instead of the traditional 3D glass. The bottom half will remain glass to enable wireless charging. While Apple has used a glass back since the âiPhoneâ 8 and âiPhoneâ X in 2017, earlier âiPhoneâ modelsâexcept the âiPhoneâ 3G, âiPhoneâ 3GS, and âiPhoneâ 5Câhad aluminum rears. Additionally, the aluminum camera bump on the âiPhone 17â Pro will reportedly be larger than in previous models, according to <em>The Information</em>.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    4. New Display Sizes</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
Last year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max got bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For 2025, Apple is also expected to bring the larger 6.27-inch display size to its standard âiPhoneâ model, while the equivalent "iPhone 17 Plus" model (provisionally called "iPhone 17 Air") could adopt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">completely new display dimensions</a>. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    5. 120Hz ProMotion (Always-on Display)</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple intends to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/">expand</a> ProMotion to all iPhone models in 2025, allowing all models to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/ltpo-for-all-iphone-17-models-report/">ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate</a> for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Previously, only "Pro" models in Apple's iPhone lineup have had the feature. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor/">iPhone 17 "Air"</a> to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">6. Apple-Designed Wi-Fi 7 Chip</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's premium 2025 models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-apple-wifi-7-chip-rumor/">expected</a> to be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip for the first time. Wi-Fi 7 support would allow the "Pro" models to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. The Wi-Fi chip would also allow Apple to further reduce its dependance on external suppliers like Broadcom, which currently supplies Apple with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">7. 48MP Telephoto Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
An upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto lens on Apple's premium devices is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/">expected</a> to be optimized for use with Apple's Vision Pro headset, although we don't how any details on how it will interface with the Vision Pro. The upgraded Telephoto would make the iPhone 17 Pro models the first iPhones to have a rear camera system <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-pro-rumored-features/">composed entirely of 48-megapixel lenses</a>, making it capable of capturing even more photographic detail. The new Telephoto lens will offer 3.5x zoom (85mm equivalent) instead of the 5x zoom (120mm equivalent) currently available, according to one rumor. This focal length is generally better suited for portraits and everyday photography, since it allows users to frame shots without having to move as far away from the subject. However, the big shift allegedly comes from the new 48MP sensor, in that the extra resolution allows for digital cropping to simulate longer focal lengths, offering less quality loss than normal digital zoom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">8. 8K Video Recording</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/iphone-16-pro-4k-at-120fps-video-rumor/">tested 8K video recording</a> on the iPhone 16 Pro models, but such functionality is still not available. With the iPhone 17 Pro models expected to have entirely 48-megapixel rear cameras, there is a good chance that 8K video recording will debut on those devices. Several rival smartphones currently offer 8K video recording capabilities, such as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Google Pixel 9 Pro (via AI upscaling). Even though 8K video recording isn't widely used by content creators right now, there are still use cases for it. For example, shooting 8K would allow videographers to record using the Ultra Wide camera and then crop in 50% and still achieve 4K resolution. Notably, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman in February <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-23/apple-abandons-budget-phones-inside-apple-s-modem-m4-macbook-air-launch-timing">reported</a> that Apple plans to emphasize the iPhone 17 Pro's improved video recording capabilities when it unveils the device later this year, so it's quite possible that 8K video recording will be one of the capabilities that Apple will tout when the new lineup launches.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">9. 24MP Selfie Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 17 Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 lineup will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">24-megapixel front-facing camera</a> with a six-element lens, according to one rumor. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and last year's iPhone 16 lineup features the same hardware. The upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">10. Scratch Resistant Anti-Reflective Display</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 17 Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">according to one rumor</a>, although the new iPhone 16 Pro models do have the latest-generation Ceramic Shield, which has an advanced formulation that is 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 is said to have a "super-hard anti-reflective layer" that is "more scratch-resistant." It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">11. More Memory</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
At least one model in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup will come with 12GB. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">Jeff Pu</a> of investment firm Haitong has claimed that both Pro models will come with the upped RAM, while Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes only the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/kuo-12gb-ram-iphone-17-pro-max-exclusive/">iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature 12GB</a>. In contrast, another <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/iphone-17-feature-12gb-ram-up-from-8gb/">reliable source</a> has claimed that all iPhone 17 models will have 12GB of RAM. For comparison, the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have 6GB of RAM, and the iPhone 15 Pro models have 8GB of RAM, while all iPhone 16 models have 8GB of RAM. Any such increase would allow for improved multitasking on the iPhone, as well as provide additional resources for Apple Intelligence features that require large-language models to be resident in memory.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">12. Smaller Dynamic Island</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's highest-end 2025 iPhone will feature a significantly narrower Dynamic Island, thanks to the device's adoption of a smaller "metalens" for the Face ID system, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">claims</a> Haitong's Jeff Pu and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-max-smaller-dynamic-island/">Chinese leaker</a>. While a traditional iPhone camera has curved lenses that redirect light towards the image sensor, a metalens is a thin and flat lens with microscopic patterns etched onto it that can focus light more precisely. Assuming this results in a narrowed Dynamic Island, it would be the first time that Apple has changed the feature since it debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">13. A19 Processor</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 17 Models</span><br><br/>
Apple typically upgrades iPhones with faster and more efficient chip technology each year. While we are not expecting the iPhone 17 series to get TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/iphone-17-unlikely-to-get-2nm-chip/">next-generation 2-nanometer chips</a>, Apple's A19 chip technology is likely to be built on an upgraded 3-nanometer process. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to include an A19 Pro chip, while the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air could have the standard A19 chip. TSMC is working on its N3P process, with mass production set to begin in late 2024, so that's the chip technology that we're <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/kuo-iphone-17-3nm-chips/">expecting Apple will use for the iPhone 17 lineup</a>. Compared to <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21394/tsmc-performanceoptimized-3nm-process-technology-on-track-for-mass-production-this-year">earlier versions of 3nm chips</a>, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">14. Custom Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Chip</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 17 Models</span><br><br/>
Apple is switching over to a new Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">designed in-house starting in 2025</a>. The combined Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip will replace iPhone components from Broadcom, allowing Apple to reduce its reliance on the company. Apple's Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip is distinct from the C1 modem chip that Apple recently debuted in the new iPhone 16e, but eventually, Apple wants to combine these into a single component. The new Wi-Fi chip means that all four iPhone 17 models will support Wi-Fi 7 chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-17-air-wifi-7-rumor/">according to Jeff Pu</a>, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">15. New Thermal Design</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 17 Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 lineup will feature a vapor chamber heatsink to improve thermal performance, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/iphone-17-major-thermal-upgrade/">according to one report</a>. Vapor chamber technology is already used in many high-end Android devices. Vapor chambers work by spreading heat evenly across a larger surface area, preventing thermal throttling and maintaining consistent performance, which is particularly beneficial in slim devices. The report claims that the every model in the iPhone 17 series will adopt the improved thermal heat spreader.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">16. Reverse Wireless Charging</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple has reportedly tested a wireless reverse charging feature for its upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models that would make the iPhone capable of delivering power to other Apple devices, according to the Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-17-pro-reverse-charging-feature/">Instant Digital</a>. The Chinese leaker claims that Apple is testing a 7.5W wireless charging feature for iPhone 17 Pro models, and it could be used to charge other Apple accessories like AirPods, Apple Watch, or potentially an upcoming MagSafe Battery Pack.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">17. Larger Battery</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to have increased the depth of the iPhone 17 Pro Max to 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which would be a 0.475mm difference in thickness. The increase "surely means a larger battery," <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/">according to one leaker</a>. Apart from depth, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame reportedly remains unchanged, and is otherwise identical to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/17-reasons-to-wait-for-the-iphone-17/">17 Reasons to Wait for the iPhone 17</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/17-reasons-to-wait-for-the-iphone-17.2455515/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has seemingly had one of its most useful AI tools blocked from Meta's apps. Writing Tools, which is an Apple Intelligence feature, is not available to use in Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-writing-tools.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960221" /><br/>
Apple's Writing Tools include options to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text almost anywhere you can type in iOS 18. A long press in a text input field usually brings up the feature, but not in any of Meta's apps currently. <br/>
<br/>
Brazilian blog <em><a href="https://sorcererhat.tech/articles/meta-impede-o-uso-da-apple-intelligence-em-seus-apps">Sorcererhat Tech</a></em> spotted the lack of Writing Tools across Meta's apps, which appears to have been the case since late last year. Developers can choose whether to allow the tools in their apps, so it looks as if Meta has declined the offer. <br/>
<br/>
According to a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-meta-talks-ai-model-ios-18/">June 2024</a>, Apple held discussions with Meta about integrating the Facebook owner's AI model into iOS 18 as part of its Apple Intelligence feature set. However, Apple turned down the AI partnership due to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-meta-ai-privacy-concerns/">privacy concerns</a>. Apple instead ended up signing a deal with OpenAI to include optional ChatGPT access in its Siri responses.<br/>
<br/>
Given the history of acrimony between the two companies â from Apple device interoperability demands to App Store feuds â it's not all that surprising that Meta would choose to keep Apple's AI out of its apps. Meta has also since rolled out its own AI features across its platforms.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/apple-intelligence-not-available-in-meta-apps/">Apple Intelligence Feature Not Available in Meta Apps Like Facebook, Instagram</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-feature-not-available-in-meta-apps-like-facebook-instagram.2455511/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[xAI has <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1912670182012801156">rolled out</a> a new memory feature for Grok, its conversational AI, making the chatbot smarter and more personalized over time. With memory enabled, Grok can now recall past interactions â like your preferences or previous questions â to provide more relevant recommendations and responses.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/grok-ai-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990433" /><br/>
According to xAI, this feature brings Grok in line with memory capabilities already found in platforms like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chatgpt-memory-improvements/">ChatGPT</a> and Gemini, where chat history can be revisited and used to enhance future conversations. Users can now rely on Grok to pick up where they left off, improving long-term usability.<br/>
<br/>
The memory feature is currently available in beta on the Grok website and through its iOS and Android apps. However, users in the EU and UK will have to wait, as the feature isn't yet supported in those regions. xAI says it plans to integrate memory into Grok's built-in version on X (formerly Twitter) "soon."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Grok now remembers your conversations. When you ask for recommendations or advice, youâll get personalized responses. <a href="https://t.co/UXhX7BjS57">pic.twitter.com/UXhX7BjS57</a></p>&mdash; Grok (@grok) <a href="https://twitter.com/grok/status/1912670182012801156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div><br/>
Just like with other memory-enabled AI tools, users have the ability to <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1912670183472476653">manage what Grok remembers</a>, although telling Grok to "Forget" referenced chats won't delete them from the user's history.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/grok/">Grok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/grok-ai-chatbot-gains-memory-feature/">Grok AI Chatbot Gains Memory Feature for Smarter, Personalized Chats</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/grok-ai-chatbot-gains-memory-feature-for-smarter-personalized-chats.2455509/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone 18 models will adopt TSMC's 2nm manufacturing process for the next-generation A20 chip, which will bring substantial performance and power efficiency improvements to next year's iPhones, but it may also incur significantly more costs that Apple could pass onto the customer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/a20-chip-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995953" /><br/>
The latest corroboration that Apple will use TSMC's 2nm process in next year's iPhone models comes from Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PnFnbnHSO">Digital Chat Station</a>, who has sources in the Chinese supply chain. Industry analysts <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/kuo-iphone-17-3nm-chips/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/iphone-18-a20-chip-2nm-rumor/">Jeff Pu</a> have previously claimed as much, so it seems all but confirmed that Apple will adopt the more advanced silicon wafer technology.<br/>
<br/>
In 2023, Apple adopted 3nm chips for its iPhones and Macs, an upgrade over the prior 5nm mode. The switch to 3nm technology brought 20 percent faster GPU speeds, 10 percent faster CPU speed, and a 2x faster Neural Engine to the iPhone, and similar improvements on Macs. The upcoming iPhone 17 series is expected to feature processors made using TSMC's N3P chip technology â an enhanced version of the 3nm process â but 2nm adoption in the iPhone 18 is expected to bring significantly more performance and efficiency gains.<br/>
<br/>
The terms "3nm" and "2nm" describe generations of chip manufacturing technology, each with its own set of design rules and architecture. As these numbers decrease, they generally indicate smaller transistor sizes. Smaller transistors allow more to be packed onto a single chip, typically resulting in increased processing speed and improved power efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC plans to start manufacturing 2nm chips in late 2025, and Apple is expected to be the first company to receive chips built on the new process. TSMC is building two new facilities to accommodate 2nm chip production, and working on approval for a third. TSMC generally builds new fabs when it needs to increase production capacity to handle significant orders for chips, and TSMC is expanding in a major way for 2nm technology.<br/>
<br/>
However, with Apple expected to be the first major beneficiary of the new process, it is also likely to face significantly increased costs, which could see the iPhone 18 face another round of price hikes on top of possible price increases on this year's iPhone 17 models due to U.S. import tariffs. Apple scored a reprieve from the 145 percent tariff impacting goods imported from China and the 10 percent tariff on goods imported from other countries, but it doesn't sound like that's going to last.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. President Donald Trump is currently working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/trump-semiconductor-tariffs-apple/">new semiconductor levies</a> that will likely impact all Apple devices. Trump earlier this week said that no one is "getting off the hook" and there "was no tariff exception." Apple and other tech companies are "just moving to a different tariff bucket," with the 20 percent "Fentanyl Tariffs" still in place, and additional tariffs coming.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2nm/">2nm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/iphone-18-costly-2nm-process-price-hikes/">iPhone 18&#039;s Costly 2nm Process Adoption Could Lead to Price Hikes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18s-costly-2nm-process-adoption-could-lead-to-price-hikes.2455503/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
