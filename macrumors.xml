		<description><![CDATA[Tile, known for its Bluetooth tracking devices, was recently hacked, according to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/hacker-accesses-internal-tile-tool-that-provides-location-data-to-cops/">report from <em>404 Media</em></a>. A hacker was able to gain access to Tile's internal tools that are used for processing location data requests for law enforcement officers, and that gave the hacker customer names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/tile-sticker-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-797864" /><br/>
Data breaches are not uncommon these days, but Tile was not forthcoming about the attack and did not mention it until being contacted by <em>404 Media</em>. The site learned about the breach from the hacker. Tile parent company Life360 published a statement about the attack on its website after being prompted to do so by <em>404 Media</em>.<br/>
<blockquote>Similar to many other companies, Life360 recently became the victim of a criminal extortion attempt. We received emails from an unknown actor claiming to possess Tile customer information. We promptly initiated an investigation into the potential incident and detected unauthorized access to a Tile customer support platform (but not our Tile service platform). The potentially impacted data consists of information such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and Tile device identification numbers. It does not include more sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, passwords or log-in credentials, location data, or government-issued identification numbers, because the Tile customer support platform did not contain these information types.<br/>
<br/>
We believe this incident was limited to the specific Tile customer support data described above and is not more widespread. We take this event and the security of customer information seriously. We have taken and will continue to take steps designed to further protect our systems from bad actors, and we have reported this event and the extortion attempt to law enforcement. We remain committed to keeping families safe online and in the real world.</blockquote><br/>
While no location information was obtained, the incident is alarming because of the nature of the tool that the hacker was able to access. The hacker was able to get into Tile's system using credentials from a former Tile employee, and was able to get into a tool that could be used to look up Tile customers by phone number. Part of that tool allowed for searching location history.<br/>
<br/>
Tile told <em>404 Media</em> that the hacker would not have been able to access location data from the platform that was attacked, but did not confirm whether the hacker had the appropriate authentication to perform a location request once the internal tool was accessed.<br/>
<br/>
Tile is one of Apple's main competitors in the item tracking space, with Tile's trackers available as an alternative to Apple's AirTags.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/tile-hacked-customer-data-obtained/">Hackers Access Tile&#039;s Internal Tracking Tools, Customer Data</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hackers-access-tiles-internal-tracking-tools-customer-data.2429059/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The watchOS 11 update that Apple plans to release this fall offers several new widgets, including a built-in Shazam widget. Shazam has been able to be downloaded on the Apple Watch from the Apple Watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> or accessed via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, but it hasn't been available through the Smart Stack feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/shazam-for-mac.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857861" /><br/>
Apple plans to add a Shazam widget to Smart Stack with the watchOS 11 update, making it quicker to get to without &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; or downloading an app. You can access the Apple Watch Smart Stack by turning the Digital Crown.<br/>
<br/>
The Smart Stack is improving with the update, and widgets will be displayed based on time, location, and other factors, plus Live Activities are supported for keeping up with sports games or an approaching ride right from the wrist.<br/>
<br/>
Along with Shazam, other new Smart Stack widget additions include severe weather alerts, Translate, Training Load (a new watchOS 11 Workout feature), <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, and Distance. watchOS 11 is currently available to developers for testing purposes, with Apple planning to release the software to the public this fall. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shazam/">Shazam</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/watchos-11-shazam-widget/">watchOS 11 Gains Integrated Shazam Widget for Identifying Songs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-gains-integrated-shazam-widget-for-identifying-songs.2429057/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> have an Adaptive Audio feature that includes Adaptive Noise Control, Personalized Volume, and Conversation Awareness, which are all features that adjust sound and Active Noise Cancellation in response to the environment around you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/airpods-adaptive-audio.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955239" /><br/>
Right now, Adaptive Audio is an all or nothing setting, but that's set to change in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple added a "Customize Adaptive Audio" menu that lets you adjust the setting to allow for more or less noise.<br/>
<br/>
When the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware/">latest beta firmware</a> are connected to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, you can open up the AirPods section of the Settings app to see a new Adaptive Audio section.<br/>
<br/>
Tapping into it presents a slider bar where you can adjust Adaptive Audio for Less Noise or More Noise, impacting the Adaptive Audio settings. The feature will mostly apply to Adaptive Noise Control, a feature that blends Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation. It is designed to tweak the level of noise control based on changing conditions in the environment, so being able to set it to allow for more noise or less noise will come in handy.<br/>
<br/>
The setting will also impact Personalized Volume, an option that adjusts the volume of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 based on your personal volume preferences and environmental conditions.<br/>
<br/>
These settings will be widely available to &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 owners when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; launches in the fall. The earbuds will also be able to be adjusted using iPadOS 18 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-adaptive-audio-options/">iOS 18 Adds More Control Over Adaptive Audio on AirPods Pro 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-adds-more-control-over-adaptive-audio-on-airpods-pro-2.2429056/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> has had a Power Reserve function that holds back a small amount of battery life to allow features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> and NFC unlocking to work even when your device has died, and in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple seems to be improving the feature further for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
As demonstrated on Reddit, when the battery on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is exhausted, the phone can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1ddpgb4/ios_18_db1_you_can_now_see_the_time_even_after/">continue to show the time</a> in the upper left corner of the device, which is a small but useful upgrade. The battery icon still shows up, and you'll see "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is Findable" while reserve battery is left. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-iphone-time-off.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955275" /><br/>
It appears that this feature is limited to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models. We tested on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro Max and were not ale to get the time to show up, but it did work as expected with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max. <br/>
<br/>
Power Reserve has been a feature on iPhones dating back to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XR and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS, so it's not clear what the limiting factor is in terms of showing the time on display when the battery has drained on older devices. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-time-no-battery-life/">Your iPhone 15 Can Show the Time When It&#039;s Out of Battery in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/your-iphone-15-can-show-the-time-when-its-out-of-battery-in-ios-18.2429053/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just months after naming AllTrails the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-unveils-app-store-award-winners-the-best-apps-and-games-of-2023/">iPhone App of the Year in 2023</a>, Apple has added new hiking features of its own to the Maps app on iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Hiking-Trails-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955271" /><br/>
Apple Maps users in the U.S. can browse thousands of hikes across all 63 national parks in the country, filtered by length, elevation, and route type. Users can also create and save their own custom walking and hiking routes, with one-way, out-and-back, and loop routing options to choose from where available. <br/>
<br/>
Apple Maps added topographic maps on the Apple Watch with watchOS 10 last year, and these maps are now available on the iPhone too with iOS 18. Topographic maps and hikes can be saved for offline access with turn-by-turn voice guidance.<br/>
<br/>
These features are mostly limited to the U.S., but topographic maps are also available in Japan, according to fine print <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18-preview/">on Apple's website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes all of the features:<blockquote>Apple Maps introduces even more ways to explore the world, including hikes and custom walking routes. Users can browse thousands of hikes across national parks in the United States — filtered by length, elevation, and route type — and save them to use while offline. Users can also create their own custom walking routes with just a few taps to plan everything from a local exercise route to a full-day walking tour in a new city. Additionally, they can save their favorite national park hikes, custom walking routes, and places to an all-new Places Library, and add personal notes about them.</blockquote><em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a> exclusively revealed that these features were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/">coming to Apple Maps on the iPhone</a> earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is currently in beta and should be released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/apple-maps-hiking-features-on-ios-18/">Apple Maps Rivals AllTrails on iOS 18 With New Hiking Features in U.S.</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-rivals-alltrails-on-ios-18-with-new-hiking-features-in-u-s.2429049/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 18 Will Let You Activate Third-Party Camera From iPhone&#039;s Lock Screen or Action Button</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> includes a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/lockedcameracapture">LockedCameraCapture framework</a> for developers, which will bring some useful new functionality to third-party apps with camera features. The update will let a third-party camera app be opened directly from the Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iphone-locked-camera-capture.jpg" alt="" width="852" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955234" /><br/>
The expansion of Control Center in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; allows for third-party apps to be added to Control Center for quick access, and Control Center integrates with both the Lock Screen and the Action button. With this integration, third-party camera apps such as Halide will be able to create a Control Center camera button, which can then be added to the Control Center and stored in the new Control Center gallery.<br/>
<br/>
The Lock Screen's standard Camera and Flashlight quick access buttons can be replaced with other Control Center integrations, including third-party ones, plus the Action button can be set to a Control Center control. So the ultimate result of all of this interconnection is the option to have a quick access camera button for a third-party camera app on the Lock Screen, rather than being limited to Apple's built-in Camera.<br/>
<br/>
Further, with the specific LockedCameraCapture framework, the third-party camera app will be able to be opened into camera mode while an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is locked, mimicking the functionality that's available with the standard Camera app.<br/>
<blockquote>Use the LockedCameraCapture framework to create an extension that allows people to launch your app's camera experience and capture content quickly when the device is locked. This extension makes your camera experience accessible to people from Control Center, the Lock Screen, or the Action button.</blockquote><br/>
The framework allows for a button that opens directly into the camera of an app, even if the camera is not the app's only feature. Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and similar social networks could use this option to create a Control Center camera button able to be added to the Lock Screen that will allow for the quick capturing of photos and videos that could then be uploaded after unlocking a device.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this would not upload content directly, as there is wording in the framework that requires the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to be unlocked to view or complete a task with the video or photo captured from a locked &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
This option will also be useful for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who prefer to capture images with a third-party camera app like Halide, as it will make the Halide camera feel much more like a default camera app able to be opened up by means other than activating it from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Developers will need to add this framework to their apps, so it is a capability that we'll start seeing in action following the public launch of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-activate-camera-app-lock-screen/">iOS 18 Will Let You Activate Third-Party Camera From iPhone&#039;s Lock Screen or Action Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-will-let-you-activate-third-party-camera-from-iphones-lock-screen-or-action-button.2429039/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models have an Action button in place of the Ring/Silent switch on older iPhones, and iOS 18 makes it even more useful.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Control-Center-Toggles-for-Action-Button-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955224" /><em>Screenshot Credit: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a></em></div><br/>
iOS 18 allows the Action button to be assigned to one of the dozens of controls available in the new Control Center gallery, allowing the Action button to invoke Dark Mode, Airplane Mode, Personal Hotspot, and more. Options like Low Power Mode and Orientation Lock do not appear to be available as of iOS 18 beta 1, but the Shortcut action already allows the Action button to be assigned to those options if desired.<br/>
<br/>
These new options are in addition to the actions that were already available for the Action button on iOS 17, including Ring/Silent, Do Not Disturb, Camera, Flashlight, Voice Memo, Magnifier, Translate, Shortcut, and Accessibility. Some of the new Control Center options were already possible with the Shortcut or Accessibility options.<br/>
<br/>
It has been rumored that the Action button will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">expanded to all four iPhone 16 models</a> later this year, so these new controls will come to even more devices.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is currently in beta and should be released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/action-button/">Action Button</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-control-center-options-action-button/">iOS 18 Adds Control Center Options to Action Button on iPhone 15 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-adds-control-center-options-to-action-button-on-iphone-15-pro.2429032/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the WWDC keynote on Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook discussed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence</a> and more with popular tech content creators Justine Ezarik (iJustine), Marques Brownlee (MKBHD), and Safwan AhmedMia (SuperSaf). The videos are now on YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Tim-Cook-WWDC-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955202" /><br/>
Cook touched on how Apple Intelligence features are designed to improve the lives of customers, with strong privacy safeguards in place.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence will allow users to summarize text and notifications, create custom emoji and images, and more. Siri is also getting smarter with Apple Intelligence, with richer language understanding and more per-app controls. These features will require an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, or a Mac or iPad with an M1 chip or newer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence will be available when iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia are released later this year, but the features will have a beta label at launch. Developers will be able to start testing the features on the iOS 18 beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-ios-18-beta/">later this summer</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On iPhone 15 models, iOS 18 will recommend that users set a particular charging limit for their device based on their recent usage habits, with the aim of potentially improving their iPhone battery's lifespan by reducing the time that the battery is fully charged.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iphone-battery-charge-limit-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955180" /><br/>
All four iPhone 15 models feature a setting that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-battery-charging-limit/">prevents the devices from charging beyond 80%</a> while toggled on, and iOS 18 expands the feature by adding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-introduces-more-charging-limits/">new 85%, 90%, and 95% charging limit options</a>. With the new limit options, iOS 18 now takes a proactive approach to improving battery longevity by recommending a specific charging limit to users via a notification.<br/>
<br/>
The recommendation also appears in the Settings app under Battery → Charging. The charging limit feature remains exclusive to the iPhone 15 lineup on the first iOS 18 beta, with the option not found on the iPhone 14 Pro or older.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-recommended-charge-limit.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955190" /><br/>
In a related change, anecdotal reports suggest that iOS 18 could be recalibrating some devices' maximum battery capacity percentage. In Settings ➝ Battery ➝ Battery Health, "Maximum Capacity" is a measure of battery capacity relative to when the device was new. Lower capacity can result in fewer hours of usage between charges.<br/>

The first iOS 18 beta is available for Apple Developer Program members, and a public beta will follow in July. After beta testing is complete, the update should be widely released to all users with an iPhone XS or newer in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-charging-limit-recommendations/">iOS 18 Actively Recommends Charging Limit Based on iPhone 15 Usage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-actively-recommends-charging-limit-based-on-iphone-15-usage.2429011/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Vision Pro launches in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the U.K. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/vision-pro-launching-in-more-countries/">on Friday, July 12</a>, and you will be able to try out the spatial computer at your local Apple Store in those countries starting on the same day next month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Demo.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933882" /><br/>
Starting on Friday, July 12 at 8 a.m. local time, until the end of the day on Sunday, July 14, Apple Stores in the five aforementioned countries will allow customers to receive a Vision Pro demo on a first-come, first-served basis. As happened in the U.S., demos will likely shift to an appointment basis starting on the following Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the Vision Pro costs thousands of dollars, the 30-minute demo provides customers with a free way to experience spatial computing without having to spend a fortune. During the demo, customers will learn how to navigate the visionOS operating system, and explore built-in apps such as Apple TV, Photos, and Safari.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro will be available to pre-order in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the U.K. starting Friday, June 28 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time. The spatial computer is also launching in China, Japan, and Singapore, with pre-orders starting on Thursday, June 13, at 6 p.m. Pacific Time in those countries, ahead of a June 28 launch.<br/>
<br/>
visionOS 1.2 adds support for languages in these additional countries and regions, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-announces-visionos-2/">visionOS 2 with a range of new features</a> will be available later this year.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple has some additional features in Safari 18 that are likely to be welcomed by Mac users. Here's a quick rundown of what's new.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/safari-highlights.jpg" alt="" width="2752" height="1850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955139" /><br/>
Safari's headline feature in macOS 15 is something called Highlights, which aims to make it easier to discover information on the web. <br/>
<br/>
Highlights can be accessed via a new site menu icon that appears in the address bar, from which you can quickly pull up relevant information about a site, such as directions, summaries, or quick links to learn more about people, music, movies, and TV shows. <br/>
<br/>
As of writing this, Highlights does not appear to work outside of the United States, so it is likely to be region-specific at this early state. However, there are other changes to Safari that are live wherever you are located.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/safari-18-reader.jpg" alt="" width="2940" height="1912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955125" /><br/>
The Reader mode in Safari has received an overhaul, and now offers more customization options once you have enabled it on a site using the Reader button in the address bar.<br/>
<br/>
If you click the button again, a dropdown menu lets you change the theme (white, off-white, gray, black) and choose your preferred font (Athelas, Charter, Georgia, Iowan, New York, Palatino, San Fransisco, Seravek, and Times New Roman). <br/>
<br/>
In this menu, you can also find text size options by percentage (from 50% to 300%), as well as a "Find..." option to find a word or phrase on a page, and a button to Hide Reader mode.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that Reader can also provide a summary of an article, along with a table of contents in a sidebar, but we could not get this to work, likely because it is an aspect of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence</a>, which will not be introduced until later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/safari-video-viewer.jpg" alt="" width="2940" height="1912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955129" /><br/>
Meanwhile, when Safari detects a video on the page, a new Video Viewer mode puts the media front and center, which allows you to adjust the window without obscuring the video. It also helpfully presents system playback controls within an overlay, including Picture in Picture. <br/>
<br/>
In other Safari-related changes, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta adds support for opening links directly in web apps. Now, when you click a link, that link should open in the web app instead of your default web browser.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's stock price continues to surge following its WWDC keynote this week, where it introduced an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence suite of AI features</a> coming to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. In intraday trading today, Apple overtook Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company again, but the two tech giants may trade places throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Mint.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834995" /><br/>
Apple's stock crossed the &#36;200 mark and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/aapl-all-time-high-wwdc-2024/">set a new all-time high</a> on Tuesday, and it has rose another 3% today as of writing. Generative AI has been a buzz topic for investors since ChatGPT debuted in 2022, and Apple finally unveiling its own strategy for the technology has likely contributed to this surge.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features will allow users to summarize text, create custom emoji and images, receive priority notifications, and more. Siri is also getting smarter with Apple Intelligence, with richer language understanding and more per-app controls. The features will require an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, or a Mac or iPad with an M1 chip or newer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple had a market cap of &#36;3.28 trillion as of writing, compared to &#36;3.25 trillion for Microsoft.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/apple-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-company-again/">Apple Passes Microsoft to Become World&#039;s Most Valuable Company Again</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-passes-microsoft-to-become-worlds-most-valuable-company-again.2428993/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> has added a new multicolor swatch to the Font & Color customization options on the Lock Screen, so now you can display the time in rainbow colors against your chosen wallpaper.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/clock-color-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955111" /><br/>
Unlike the other color swatches, the multicolor option does not currently apply to widgets and the date, which turn white when the rainbow effect is applied. However, there's a good chance this is something Apple intends to implement but has not yet got around to doing so in the developer beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; also allows users to change the two Flashlight and Camera shortcut buttons on the Lock Screen to an action of their choice for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
The ability to change these Lock Screen controls is part of a wave of new customization features in ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;‌, which includes app icon color-changing capabilities and more. The first public beta is set to arrive in July and the official release of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is scheduled for the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-lock-screen-multicolor-clock-option/">iOS 18 Lock Screen Customization Options Include Multicolor Clock</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-lock-screen-customization-options-include-multicolor-clock.2428985/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple has introduced a new window tiling management feature that aims to make it easy to arrange open windows into a layout that works best for you. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-15-tiling.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955093" /><br/>
PC users have had tiling since at least Windows 7 and Aero Snap, and if you've ever used those, the new window tiling feature in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; will be familiar. In the absence of the feature, Mac users have relied on several third-party tools like Magnet, Moom, and Rectangle to achieve similar results, but as things stand, in beta 1, window management in macOS still needs some work before it can approach the utility of those apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tiling-macos-two-apps.jpg" alt="" width="2940" height="1912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955097" /><br/>
When you drag a window to the edge of the screen, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; suggests a tiled position by displaying a frame, and you release the window to drop it right into place. This way, you can quickly arrange two app windows side by side, or place four windows in corners to keep several apps in view at once. When a window has been dragged to tile on one side or the other, dragging it back immediately resizes it to its original width and height, which is a nice touch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-tiled-two-apps.jpg" alt="" width="2940" height="1912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955098" /><br/>
The dragging system is far from infallible though. If you drag a window to the side of the screen and hold it for more than a couple of seconds, you can sometimes unintentionally switch to an adjacent desktop space if one is active. It can also be quite tricky to place certain app windows so that they snap to corners.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-tiling-overlapping.jpg" alt="" width="2940" height="1912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955099" /><br/>
Also, some apps by design will not reduce down beyond a certain size, so you can end up with tiled windows overlapping each other or falling off the screen. If you have a group of apps that play nice together when tiled, the tiling system can leave unsightly gaps between the windows where the desktop wallpaper is exposed, but there's a setting that can rectify this.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/system-settings-tiling.jpg" alt="" width="1510" height="1052" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955095" /><br/>
In System Settings, you'll find tiling options in a new section in the Desktop & Dock menu. For example, tiling can be activated by holding the Option key while dragging windows. You can also toggle off "Tiled windows have margins," which reduces gaps between windows.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tiling-options-green-traffic-light.jpg" alt="" width="842" height="642" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955096" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: MacRumors forum member <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-15-all-the-little-things.2428658/post-33196329">Danbalsh</a></em></div><br/>
macOS 15 also adds new tiling options to the green traffic light in the top corner of windows. Hover your pointer over the green button, and a menu appears with options to move and resize or fill and arrange all open windows. These options generally seem to work better than the drag-to-snap tiling system in its current state.   <br/>
<br/>
Overall, tiling windows in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; does not feel properly implemented yet, but this is developer beta 1, and Apple will surely refine its functionality before we get to the public release of macOS 15 in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/macos-sequoia-window-tiling/">macOS Sequoia: How Window Tiling and Snapping Currently Works</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-how-window-tiling-and-snapping-currently-works.2428978/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://alogic.co/?ref=y2uwzwu">Alogic</a> today introduced several new display options that it plans to ship out later in 2024, including a 5K 27-inch touchscreen display, several ultrawide displays, and portable touchscreen monitors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/alogic-clarity-display-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955077" /><br/>
The Clarity Touch 5K 27" UHD Monitor has a resolution identical to that of the Studio Display or the LG UltraFine 5K, but with the added benefit of touch integration. We previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/alogic-clarity-pro-touch-displays/">reviewed a pair</a> of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/alogic-clarity-max-touch-display/">4K Clarity displays</a> with touchscreen capabilities and found the touchscreen to be useful in certain circumstances for scrolling through websites, accessing controls, and performing simple tasks in apps. The touchscreen can be interacted with using a finger or a stylus.<br/>
<br/>
Alogic's 5K touchscreen display supports HDR 400, is able to charge a connected Mac at up to 65 watts over USB-C, and it includes several connectivity options. There are two HDMI 2.1 ports, a DisplayPort 1.4 port, a USB-C port, two USB-A ports with 7.5-watt charging for accessories and 5 Gb/s data transfer speeds, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. Slim bezels maximize display area and there is an adjustable stand that works in either landscape or portrait orientation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/alogic-clarity-display-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955078" /><br/>
There are also three new ultrawide displays coming from Alogic, including the 34-inch Edge Ultrawide QHD Monitor, the 40-inch Ultrawide QHD Monitor, and the 34-inch Horizon Ultrawide QHD Touchscreen. The two Edge displays each have a 3440x1440 resolution and a slim design that prioritizes aesthetics, while the Horizon has a 3440x1440 touch display and a foldable stand so that it can be converted into a tablet mode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/edge-display-alogic.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955080" /><br/>
For extra display space on the go, Alogic has also introduced the Xtend 15-inch and Xpand 17-inch Portable 5K Touchscreen Monitors, both of which have a tablet-like design and a cover that folds out into a small stand. Pressure-sensitive stylus input is supported, with Alogic aiming these displays at artists and traveling workers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/alogic-portable-display.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955081" /><br/>
Alogic's final new display, the Slate 28-inch Double Vertical QHD Monitor, has a 16:18 resolution and it looks like two 2560x1440 resolution displays stacked vertically. It is ideal for web browsing, coding, and similar applications, and Alogic says it works well as secondary display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/alogic-slate-studio-updated.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955132" /><br/>
The two Edge displays and the Clarity 5K will launch in August, while the rest of the display options are set to come out in September 2024. More information can be <a href="https://alogic.co/?ref=y2uwzwu">found on the Alogic website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alogic/">Alogic</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/alogic-5k-touchscreen-display/">Alogic Unveils 5K 27-Inch Touchscreen Display and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alogic-unveils-5k-27-inch-touchscreen-display-and-more.2428976/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple introduced a new design for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app that replaces the Library and For You sections with a more integrated all-in-one view, and part of that redesign includes an overhauled Utilities section that makes it easier to find different types of images.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-photos-utilities.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955074" /><br/>
Rather than being limited to Imports, Duplicates, Hidden, and Recently Deleted as in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, the Utilities section of the app has all of the following categories:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Hidden</li><br/>
 	<li>Recently Deleted</li><br/>
 	<li>Duplicates</li><br/>
 	<li>Receipts</li><br/>
 	<li>Handwriting</li><br/>
 	<li>Illustrations</li><br/>
 	<li>QR Codes</li><br/>
 	<li>Recently Saved</li><br/>
 	<li>Recently Viewed</li><br/>
 	<li>Recently Edited</li><br/>
 	<li>Documents</li><br/>
 	<li>Imports</li><br/>
 	<li>Maps</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You've been able to search for things like receipts in prior versions of iOS, and still can, but having them in a dedicated Utilities section makes them quicker to locate.<br/>
<br/>
Along with Utilities, the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app also features Media Types, and while this section is largely the same, there is a new Animated category. The Animated category and the Illustrations utility section may be aimed at the image generation tools that are coming to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; as part of the Apple Intelligence feature set.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also added a "Pinned Collections" section to &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, which houses things that you might want quick access to like Videos, Favorites, Screenshots, and Selfies. Collections are a repeat of content that can be found elsewhere in &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, but you can customize it to your liking so you see your preferred content at the top of the app. These changes to &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; are in iPadOS 18 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> as well as &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-photos-app-utilities/">iOS 18 Photos App Adds New Utilities Categories for Finding QR Codes, Receipts, Illustrations and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-photos-app-adds-new-utilities-categories-for-finding-qr-codes-receipts-illustrations-and-more.2428937/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple updated the Battery section of the Settings app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> to add a feature that lets you know if you charged your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a "slow" charger.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-battery-slow-charging.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955071" /><br/>
Periods of slow charging are shown with an orange bar in the portion of the Battery settings that show battery usage and charging over the past 24 hours or the past 10 days.<br/>
<br/>
We saw the slow charging notice after charging with a 5W wireless charger, as did <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1ddhrju/ios_18_db1_warning_when_connected_to_a_slow/">a Redditor</a> who highlighted the feature. It's not clear what exactly is considered "slow," but the designation is useful for those who are seeing slow charging speeds and aren't sure why.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-slow-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1534" height="863" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955072" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Image via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1ddhrju/ios_18_db1_warning_when_connected_to_a_slow/">Reddit</a></div></em><br/>
Many wireless chargers claim to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> while being limited to Qi speeds or below, so this feature could help &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users understand why their devices aren't charging at optimum speed. There does not appear to be an option to enable an alert when charging from a slow charger, which could be an arguably better feature because the battery settings are somewhat hidden.<br/>
<br/>
There is a tappable information button that accompanies slow charging notices, but as of right now, it goes to a support document that does not yet exist.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-slow-charger-battery-settings/">iOS 18&#039;s Battery Section Tells You If You Used a Slow Charger</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18s-battery-section-tells-you-if-you-used-a-slow-charger.2428933/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

Saved to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; replaces Apps Using &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, and it provides more information at a glance. Rather than just listing whether &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; is on for an app, you can see how much storage space Messages takes up, how many Notes are stored, how many <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> are in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Tapping into each section provides additional detail and tools for managing storage, much of which was available before. While the main interface no longer shows where the majority of &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; storage is going by file type, tapping the Storage bar shows the full breakdown and list of apps using the most storage. <br/>
<br/>
If you subscribe to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+, there's a new "Subscriber Edition" icon, which is similar to the icon that Apple uses for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a>+. &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ features can be listed and managed through the &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ section.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a more prominent "Recommended For You" suggestions interface that recommends things like deleting inactive backups, upgrading to a new &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ plan, and more, along with quicker access to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; backups.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/icloud-interface-overhaul-ios-18/">iCloud Interface Gets Overhaul in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/icloud-interface-gets-overhaul-in-ios-18.2428927/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since there was so much to take in at yesterday's WWDC keynote event, we thought we'd revisit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and highlight some of the most exciting features that Apple introduced. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Note that we've left out Apple Intelligence, which is what Apple is calling the AI features that it plans to add. Apple Intelligence will be limited to Apple's newest iPhones, but the features we've listed will be available on older iPhones, too.<br/>
