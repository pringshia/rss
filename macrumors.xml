		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is hosting record low discounts on two AirPods models, including the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C and the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case. You can also find a solid discount on the AirPods 2 in these deals.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-2-and-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Blue-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895347" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C are available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. This is a match of the record low price on these AirPods, which feature a new USB-C port as well as improved dust resistance and 20-bit 48kHz lossless audio when paired with the Apple Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The AirPods 3 are on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;139.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;169.00. This is another match of an all-time low price, and for the AirPods 3 this is only the second time in 2024 that we're tracking a best-ever price on the model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;29 OFF</div>AirPods 3 for &#36;139.99</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/02/apple-arcade-takes-players-into-a-new-dimension-with-spatial-gaming/">highlighted</a> spatial gaming experiences on the Vision Pro headset, claiming that it is "the beginning of a new era in gaming."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Arcade-spatial-gaming-hero.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936556" /><br/>
While over 250 games are available on the Vision Pro via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, the company drew particular attention to 12 "unique spatial games" offered exclusively via the gaming subscription service.<blockquote>Spatial games built specifically for Arcade on Apple Vision Pro unlock amazing new gameplay opportunities by blending digital content with the physical world. visionOS delivers powerful spatial experiences with a brand-new three-dimensional user interface and input system controlled entirely by a user's eyes, hands, and voice. Players are able to slice apples with their hands as their living room transforms into their very own dojo in Super Fruit Ninja, tee up the perfect shot as they move freely around a quirky golf course right in their home in WHAT THE GOLF?, escape into a mesmerizing audiovisual experience in Synth Riders, and so much more.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The featured spatial games on &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; include:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li>Game Room</li><br/>
	<li>WHAT THE GOLF?</li><br/>
	<li>Cut the Rope 3</li><br/>
	<li>Jetpack Joyride 2</li><br/>

	<li>Bloons TD 6+</li><br/>
	<li>Super Fruit Ninja</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Apple added that "even more magical spatial gaming experiences" are coming soon to &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;, listing three upcoming titles:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li>Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City</li><br/>
	<li>Gibbon: Beyond the Trees</li><br/>
	<li>Spire Blast</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; launched in 2019 and is available for &#36;6.99 per month, providing access to hundreds of ad-free games across the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[TikTok today <a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokComms/status/1758129101800382905">announced</a> that it has released an app for Apple's Vision Pro headset. The app is optimized for visionOS's spatial design style, with TikTok promising a more "immersive" viewing experience for its short-form videos.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/TikTok-Vision-Pro-1.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936561" /><br/>
"Experience your For You feed in an entirely new way through this immersive content view," said TikTok, in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.<br/>
 <br/>
The app has a familiar layout on the Vision Pro, with a main "For You" video feed, along with profiles, comments, search, and more. TikTok is available now on the Vision Pro's App Store, and additional images of the app can be found below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/TikTok-Vision-Pro-2.jpeg" alt="" width="2234" height="1256" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936564" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/TikTok-Vision-Pro-3.jpeg" alt="" width="2792" height="1570" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936563" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/TikTok-Vision-Pro-4.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936562" /><br/>
There are still a handful of major social media, streaming video, and streaming music apps that are entirely unavailable on the Vision Pro, including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, and WhatsApp. In the meantime, developer Christian Selig <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/juno-youtube-app-vision-pro-new-features/">created an app called Juno</a> for watching YouTube videos on the Vision Pro.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/tiktok-app-for-apple-vision-pro/">TikTok Releases Vision Pro App With &#039;Immersive&#039; Viewing Experience</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-releases-vision-pro-app-with-immersive-viewing-experience.2419522/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung is preparing to join Apple's OLED display supply chain for future MacBook models, Korea's <a href="https://thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25932"><em>The Elec</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Oled-MackBook-Pros-23.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-891130" /><br/>
Apple's plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/macbook-pro-oled-three-years-away/">switch the MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> from mini-LED and LCD display technology to OLED have been widely rumored for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/future-ipad-pro-macbook-pro-oled-displays/">several years</a>. The latest report explains that Samsung is currently assembling an eighth-generation OLED panel production line focused on supplying Apple with OLED displays for future MacBook models. Panels from the production line will not reach new MacBook models until 2027, <em>The Elec</em> adds.<br/>
<br/>
Late last year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-plans-to-bring-oled-to-nine-new-devices/"><em>ETNews</em> said</a> that Apple plans to bring OLED display technology to nine new devices by 2027, starting with two new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models in March. The company is then expected to shift focus to an OLED 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2025, before launching new 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13- and 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, 10.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and 8.7-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> models with OLED displays the following year. As a result, the <em>The Elec</em>'s report seems to suggest that panels from the new production line will not be used in the first wave of OLED MacBooks in 2025. In 2027, Apple is expected to bring OLED to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/">rumored 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> model.<br/>
<br/>
Benefits of OLED displays include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio, greater color accuracy, and lower power consumption compared to existing models with LCDs. OLED panels are also thinner and lighter than LCDs. Apple already uses OLED displays for all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Apple Watch models, with the exception of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/">OLED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/">The Elec</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/samsung-to-join-oled-macbook-push-in-2027/">Samsung to Join OLED MacBook Push in 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-to-join-oled-macbook-push-in-2027.2419516/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Juno, developer <a href="https://christianselig.com">Christian Selig</a>'s YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro, has received its first update since launching <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/juno-app-youtube-apple-vision-pro/">earlier this month</a>, introducing several user-requested features like the ability to select video quality.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/juno-1-1-youtube.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936542" /><br/>
Juno automatically selects the quality of videos based on its "best guess," says Selig, but previously provided no manual control. As of Juno 1.1, however, the UI includes a playback quality option, allowing users to select the resolution of the videos they watch.<br/>
<br/>
The video player has also gained quick-access volume controls, allowing users to tweak Juno's playback volume without affecting the volume level of the whole system. Selig says that he's looking into ways to link the player's audio volume to the system volume, which hopefully comes as an option.<br/>
<br/>
Another handy addition is the ability to open a video in Juno via Shortcuts or another app. To do so, users can simply replace "http://" in the URL with "juno://" (for example, juno://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7I0vHIWyO4). In addition, when Juno's video playback controls fade out, the system "grab bar" now also fades out to increase viewer immersion.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, the app's code has been improved to increase load time speed, an improved video scrubbing control has been added with a new custom view that expands on selection, and it's now easier to jump between playback speeds. Several bugs have also been squashed based on user feedback, and the player will no longer pause the video if the middle of the screen is tapped.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons for Juno's popularity is that YouTube initially said it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/youtube-spotify-vision-pro/">did not plan to offer a dedicated app</a> on Apple's Vision Pro headset. While ‌iPad‌ apps are available on Vision Pro by default, developers can opt out of having their apps appear on the device, and YouTube opted out.<br/>
<br/>
That was before Vision Pro launched. YouTube has since changed its tune and now claims that it is "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/youtube-vision-pro-app-on-roadmap/">excited</a>" by the Vision Pro launch and that an app is on the company's roadmap, but it gave no hint of timing. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/juno-for-youtube/id6476961640">Juno for YouTube</a> is priced at &#36;4.99 and the app is available on the visionOS App Store.<br/>

As one of only a few third-party desktop 2FA code generator apps on Mac, the loss of Authy Desktop is likely to disappoint users who got used to signing into 2FA-protected accounts from their computer rather than having to get out their phone, where most 2FA apps usually live. <br/>
<br/>
For users in this position that own a Mac powered by Apple silicon, Authy suggests downloading the iOS version of the app to their computer. Otherwise, Authy recommends using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/twilio-authy/id494168017">mobile version</a> instead, or switching to a <a href="https://help.twilio.com/articles/22771146070299-User-guide-End-of-Life-EOL-for-Twilio-Authy-Desktop-app">different authenticator app</a>. The bad news is that anyone who wants to switch to another 2FA app entirely will have to disable 2FA on all of their stored accounts first, because Authy lacks an export feature.<br/>

At the beginning of the year, Authy said that it was shutting down its desktop app in August 2024, so it has brought forward its decision to sunset the app by several months. The company said its decision to kill its desktop versions was made to "streamline our focus and provide more value on existing product solutions for which we see increasing demand."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/two-factor-authentication/">Two-Factor Authentication</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/authy-desktop-apps-end-of-life-march-2024/">Authy Is Sunsetting Its Desktop Authenticator Apps on March 19, 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/authy-is-sunsetting-its-desktop-authenticator-apps-on-march-19-2024.2419505/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo Browser</a> users can now securely sync their favorites, bookmarks, and passwords across multiple devices, without having to set up an account or sign in to use it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/duckduckgo-sync.jpg" alt="" width="2080" height="1144" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936522" /><br/>
The privacy-first browser enables this through its new "Sync & Backup" feature, which generates a QR code on mobile devices or an alphanumeric code on a computer to establish syncing.<br/>
<br/>
As per DuckDuckGo's privacy, DuckDuckGo doesn't track users, and cannot access users' synced data, including passwords in the browser's built-in password manager, which encrypts passwords locally. When private sync is used, all data stays securely encrypted throughout the syncing process, since the unique key needed to decrypt it is stored only on the devices.<br/>
<br/>
Backup & Sync also enables users to migrate bookmarks and passwords to a new device, and sync their Email Protection account between devices. (DuckDuckGo Email Protection is a free email forwarding service that removes hidden email trackers and lets users create unique private email addresses on the fly.)<br/>
<br/>
According to DuckDuckGo, the new feature works across most Windows, Mac, Android, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> devices, and can be found in the browser's Settings (Sync & Backup ➝ Sync With Another Device). Those only working with one device can choose Sync and Back Up This Device from the Single-Device Setup section. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/duckduckgo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936521" /><br/>
After setup, the browser generates a Recovery PDF document that contains the user's unique, locally generated Recovery Code, which can be used to gain access to synced data if the associated devices are lost or damaged.<br/>
<br/>
DuckDuckGo's browser offers more than a dozen privacy protections, including ad tracker blocking and cookie pop-up removal. It is available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/duckduckgo-private-browser/id663592361?platform=iphone">iOS devices on the App Store</a> and for Mac on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/duckduckgo-private-browser/id663592361">Mac App Store</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/mac">DuckDuckGo website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duckduckgo/">DuckDuckGo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/duckduckgo-browser-password-sync/">DuckDuckGo Browser Gets Encrypted Bookmark and Password Syncing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/duckduckgo-browser-gets-encrypted-bookmark-and-password-syncing.2419502/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All of Apple's products have a 14-day return window, including the &#36;3,500 Vision Pro. For those who purchased a Vision Pro online or in a retail store on the February 2 launch date, the two week return window will end on Friday, February 16.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-case-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931669" /><br/>
With the Vision Pro positioned as Apple's first dedicated AR/VR device and the first new product category Apple has entered since 2015, many people may have purchased the headset to try it out without an intention to keep it. Multiple buyers on social media networks have also been reporting returns this week because of eye strain, the comfort of the device, the bulky size, a lack of apps and functionality, or an inability to find a day-to-day use case for it.<br/>
<br/>
If you bought a Vision Pro and haven't found it to be worth the purchase price, Apple will take it back, and the same goes for accessories like the &#36;200 Vision Pro Travel Case.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What a bummer of a day. Can’t believe it, but I’ve returned the Vision Pro. Just too uncomfortable to wear and it’s a strain on my eyes. It’s clearly the future. It works like magic. But the physical tradeoffs are just not worth it for me right now. I’ll be back for the next one,… <a href="https://t.co/LCXiPYCOvv">pic.twitter.com/LCXiPYCOvv</a></p>&mdash; Parker Ortolani (@ParkerOrtolani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1757149437502128176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Based on reports from those who have returned the device, it is a seamless process at an Apple retail location. In some cases, Apple employees will ask a number of questions about the reason for the return, but Apple does not deny returns within the 14-day window.<br/>
<br/>
Returned products must be in their original condition with the original parts, accessories, and packaging. Returns can be done at an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> or can be initiated online through Apple's support channels.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Getting closer to that return side of things as I try to use the Apple Vision Pro to improve productivity. I’m sure it works for some jobs, but I need to see serious ROI for a &#36;4000+ investment.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has pulled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> SharePlay feature that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/">was testing for the HomePod and Apple TV</a> in the iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4 betas, which suggests the option may not be available when the updates are released in March.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933114" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The first betas of tvOS 17.4 and iOS 17.4 enabled SharePlay music controls on both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, but as of the second beta, the functionality has been removed.<br/>
<br/>
SharePlay is a feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/06/ios-15-shareplay-hands-on/">that allows users</a> to watch television, listen to music, use apps, and play games together over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, but Apple has been expanding the feature. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-carplay/">SharePlay was added to CarPlay</a>, allowing everyone in the car to contribute songs to a shared playlist.<br/>
<br/>
On the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, the SharePlay feature allowed users to generate a QR code (on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> for &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;) that could be scanned to give friends and family members the option to play songs on the device. The &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; owner was required to have an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription, but those contributing content simply needed the Music app without a subscription.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if Apple will return the SharePlay feature to the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; ahead of the launch of the iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4 updates, but so far, SharePlay has been missing from the past two beta releases.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4 are set to come out in March.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation A18 and M4 chips for future iPhone and Mac models will feature an upgraded Neural Engine with "significantly" more cores, according to a report today from the Taiwanese publication <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/7769194"><em>Economic Daily News</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iOS-18-Mock-iPhone-16-Feature-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936483" /><br/>
An upgraded Neural Engine would improve performance for AI/machine learning tasks. iOS 18 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">rumored to have new generative AI features</a> for Siri, Shortcuts, Messages, Apple Music, and more. On an earnings call this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on generative AI and would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a> iOS 18 should be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June.<br/>
<br/>
A18 series chips are expected to debut in iPhone 16 models in September. It was previously rumored that some generative AI features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">could be exclusive to iPhone 16 models</a>, and the upgraded Neural Engine could be a reason why.<br/>
<br/>
Neural Engine history for iPhones:<ul><li>2-core Neural Engine in the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X</li><br/>
<li>8-core Neural Engine in the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR</li><br/>
<li>8-core Neural Engine in the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max</li><br/>
<li>16-core Neural Engine in all iPhone 12 models</li><br/>
<li>16-core Neural Engine in all iPhone 13 models</li><br/>
<li>16-core Neural Engine in all iPhone 14 models</li><br/>
<li>16-core Neural Engine in all iPhone 15 models</li></ul>Apple has still improved the Neural Engine's performance over the years, even when core counts have not changed. For example, Apple says the iPhone 15 Pro's A17 Pro chip has up to a 2x faster Neural Engine compared to the one in the iPhone 14 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Mac, most models with Apple silicon chips are equipped with a 16-core Neural Engine. The only exceptions are the Mac Studio and the Mac Pro, which feature a 32-core Neural Engine when configured with an M1 Ultra or M2 Ultra chip.<br/>
<br/>
The first Macs with an M4 chip would likely be released in late 2024 or early 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity in 2022 after OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts. Google, Microsoft, and other companies have also released similar chatbots and tools, including ones that can automatically generate images, respond to voice queries, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">iPhone 16 Rumored to Feature &#039;Significantly&#039; Upgraded Neural Engine for iOS 18&#039;s Generative AI Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-rumored-to-feature-significantly-upgraded-neural-engine-for-ios-18s-generative-ai-features.2419459/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its release. The third public iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 betas come a week after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-public-beta-2/">released the second betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
The iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 betas introduce a whole slew of changes for users in the European Union, allowing for alternative app stores and alternative payment methods.<br/>
<br/>
There are new options for choosing a default browser, NFC has been opened up to banks and other financial institutions, and browsers aren't mandated to use WebKit.<br/>
<br/>
Along with these changes, the update also brings new emoji characters, Podcast transcripts, tweaks to Safari, hints of what we can expect from the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/airpods-max-announced-three-years-ago/">more than three years</a> since Apple released the AirPods Max, leading some to wonder when the over-ear headphones will be updated.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Airpods-Max-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936392" /><br/>
Below, we outline when to expect new AirPods Max, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/airpods-max-2-launch-next-year-what-to-expect/">rumored features</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Timing</h2><br/>
In an October 2023 edition of his newsletter, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-29/apple-to-unveil-m3-m3-pro-m3-max-chip-macbook-pro-imac-to-reignite-mac-sales-lobgrqad"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said</a> Apple planned to release new AirPods Max in "late 2024," so the headphones are likely around 7-10 months away from being updated based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the current AirPods Max in a press release <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max/">on December 8, 2020</a>, and the headphones launched a week later.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Features</h2><br/>
Apple is only planning minor changes for the AirPods Max, including a USB-C port instead of Lightning for charging and wired audio playback, according to Gurman. He also said the headphones will be available in new color options. The current color options include Green, Pink, Silver, Sky Blue, and Space Gray.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said the updated headphones will still be considered first-generation AirPods Max, signifying how minor the changes may be.<br/>
<br/>
The updated AirPods Max will likely support Bluetooth 5.3, up from Bluetooth 5.0, for more reliable and power-efficient wireless audio connectivity.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/when-to-expect-new-airpods-max/">When to Expect New AirPods Max to Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-to-expect-new-airpods-max-to-launch.2419437/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has still not fixed a bug in macOS that causes the audio balance to drift on Macs under certain conditions, despite having acknowledged the issue 12 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/sound-balance-bug-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936342" /><br/>
A developer named Fabian highlighted the problem today in a <a href="https://x.com/ffaebi/status/1757669861377949930?s=20">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), claiming that Apple "still has not fixed the audio left/right balance bug in macOS. I still have to use an app to fix it automatically. The app is from 2015, that means we are approaching the 10 year anniversary [of the bug]."<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.tunabellysoftware.com/balance_lock/">Balance Lock</a> is the app in question, a free download available from Tunabelly Software. The bug's continuing existence was corroborated by other users who responded to the X post and commented on it over on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39367460">Hacker News</a>. However, it seems as though the issue has persisted for even longer than Fabian initially supposed. <br/>
<br/>
Writing in 2013 on <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/79384/audio-balance-changes-randomly-in-macbook-pro-retina-15-inch-mid-2012">Stack Exchange</a>, one user claimed to have experienced the same bug on multiple Macs going back to 2003. Whether or not that is the case, what we do know is that Apple acknowledged the bug on February 12, 2012 in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230419150423/https://support.apple.com/kb/TA22305?locale=nl_BE">Mac OS X 10.2 support document</a>, which is no longer on Apple's website but retrievable via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. In it Apple states: <br/>
<blockquote>In some cases the audio balance may unexpectedly drift towards the left or right channel. This can happen if you rapidly press the volume up or down keys while the computer's microprocessor is under heavy load.</blockquote>To rectify the problem, Apple advises users to open the Sound panel in System Preferences (now System Settings) and "Drag the audio balance slider to the desired position."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The year is 2024 and <a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@apple</a> still has not fixed the audio left/right balance bug in MacOS. I still have to use an app to fix it automatically. The app is from 2015, that means we are approaching the 10 year anniversary &#x1f389; <a href="https://t.co/QegD5tEvaA">https://t.co/QegD5tEvaA</a> <a href="https://t.co/saoiGubhXV">pic.twitter.com/saoiGubhXV</a></p>&mdash; Fabian (@ffaebi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ffaebi/status/1757669861377949930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Given Apple's advice at the time, it sounds like the company had not been able to come up with a proper fix when the support document was published, which begs the question as to whether it <em>still</em> has no solution to the bug, and that is why the company has let it remain in successive versions of Mac OS X and macOS up to this day. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has made another addition to its growing AI repertoire with the creation of a tool that leverages large language models (LLMs) to animate static images based on a user's text prompts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-AI-research-dall-e.jpg" alt="" width="1792" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936311" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>MacRumors image made with DALL·E</em></div><br/>
Apple describes the innovation in a new research paper titled "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06071.pdf">Keyframer: Empowering Animation Design Using Large Language Models.</a>" <br/>
<blockquote>"While one-shot prompting interfaces are common in commercial text-to-image systems like Dall·E and Midjourney, we argue that animations require a more complex set of user considerations, such as timing and coordination, that are difficult to fully specify in a single prompt—thus, alternative approaches that enable users to iteratively construct and refine generated designs may be needed especially for animations.<br/>
<br/>
"We combined emerging design principles for language-based prompting of design artifacts with code-generation capabilities of LLMs to build a new AI-powered animation tool called Keyframer. With Keyframer, users can create animated illustrations from static 2D images via natural language prompting. Using GPT-4 3, Keyframer generates CSS animation code to animate an input Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG)."</blockquote>To create an animation, the user uploads an SVG image – of a space rocket, say – then types in a prompt like "generate three designs where the sky fades into different colors and the stars twinkle." Keyframer then generates CSS code for the animation, and the user can then refine it by editing the code directly or by entering additional text prompts. <br/>
<br/>
"Keyframer enabled users to iteratively refine their designs through sequential prompting, rather than having to consider their entire design upfront," explain the authors. "Through this work, we hope to inspire future animation design tools that combine the powerful generative capabilities of LLMs to expedite design prototyping with dynamic editors that enable creators to maintain creative control."<br/>
<br/>
According to the paper, the research was informed by interviews with professional animation designers and engineers. "I think this was much faster than a lot of things I've done," said one of the study participants quoted in the paper. "I think doing something like this before would have just taken hours to do."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ai-model-animates-images-1.jpg" alt="" width="1779" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936312" /><br/>
The innovation is just the latest in a series of AI breakthroughs by Apple. Last week, Apple researchers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-ai-model-edits-images-natural-language/">released</a> an AI model that harnesses the power of multimodal LLMs to perform pixel-level edits on images. <br/>
<br/>
In late December, Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-ai-researchers-run-llms-iphones/">revealed</a> that it had made strides in deploying LLMs on iPhones and other Apple devices with limited memory by inventing an innovative flash memory utilization technique.<br/>
<br/>
Both <em>The Information</em> and analyst Jeff Pu have said that Apple will have some kind of generative AI feature available on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>‌ and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">later in the year</a>, when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is released. The next version of Apple's mobile software is said to include an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">enhanced version of Siri</a> with ChatGPT-like generative AI functionality, and has the potential to be the "biggest" update in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s history, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/ios-18-biggest-update-rumor/"><em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman</a>. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg today compared the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> to the &#36;500 Meta Quest 3 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3TkhmivNzt/">in an Instagram video</a>, and provided several reasons why he thinks Meta's headset is better than Apple's.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg" alt="" width="1385" height="779" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914163" /><br/>
According to Zuckerberg, the Quest 3 is better "for the vast majority of things that people use mixed reality for," and here are some of the things he said about the Meta Quest 3:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>It's 7x less expensive than Vision Pro.</li><br/>
 	<li>It does high-quality passthrough with big screens "just like Vision Pro."</li><br/>
 	<li>Quest is a lot more comfortable - it's 120 grams less.</li><br/>
 	<li>There are no wires that get in the way when you move around.</li><br/>
 	<li>The field of view is wider and the screen is brighter.</li><br/>
 	<li>Vision Pro has motion blur when you move around. Quest is a lot crisper.</li><br/>
 	<li>Precision controllers are available, as is hand tracking, and Quest's hand tracking is more accurate.</li><br/>
 	<li>Quest's immersive content library is a lot deeper.</li><br/>
 	<li>You can watch YouTube or play Xbox.</li><br/>

Zuckerberg said that he was surprised at the "tradeoffs" that Apple had to make to provide a higher resolution screen than is offered by the Quest 3, sacrificing "comfort," "ergonomics," and more. He went on to explain that Apple is not always the leader in a new product category, and that he hopes Meta's devices will ultimately "win."<blockquote>Now look, I know that some fanboys get upset whenever somebody dares to question if Apple is going to be the leader in a new category, but the reality is that every generation of computing has an open and a closed model. And yeah, in mobile, Apple's closed model won. It's not always that way. If you go back to the PC era, Microsoft's open model was the winner. In this next generation, Meta is going to be the open model, and I really want to make sure that the open model wins out again. The future is not yet written.</blockquote>The Meta Quest 3 launched back in October. It has two 2K LCD panels compared to the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;'s 4K microLED displays. It weighs 515 grams while the Vision Pro weighs 600 to 650 grams, and it does not have a separate battery pack. It uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, has 8GB RAM, and is equipped with Touch Plus controllers.<br/>

Meta has produced several headsets so far, including the Oculus Quest, the Oculus Quest 2, the Quest 3, and the Quest Pro. Apple plans to continue producing headsets, and rumors suggest that the next-generation version will be much more affordable. When explaining the price of the Vision Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/tim-cook-on-vision-pro-moment/">Apple CEO Tim Cook said</a> that it was "tomorrow's technology today."<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Says Quest 3 is Better Than Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-says-quest-3-is-better-than-apple-vision-pro.2419400/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A vision testing app named "Kimi" with a not-so-hidden pirated movie feature recently made its way past Apple's review team, ultimately reaching number eight on the list of top free entertainment apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/kimi-app.jpg" alt="" width="3291" height="1851" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936299" /><br/>
As reported by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/13/24071693/kimi-movie-piracy-app-store-trending-apple-iphone-ios">The Verge</a></em>, Kimi's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> listing claimed that it was an app that "tests your eyesight," but when downloaded and installed, it opened right up to a clear TV show and movie interface for downloading and watching pirated content. There was no attempt to hide the app's true purpose behind some kind of vision test interface, which begs the question of how it made its way past the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; review team.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; description mentioned comparing two pictures as an eyesight test, watching scenery, and playing games, but none of those features were present in the app.<br/>
<br/>
For an app focused on pirated content, Kimi had a fleshed out feature set. It offered top movies, search options, recommended suggestions, games, and more, with ads included for monetization purposes. The app was first approved in September, and it was available for several months in the iOS and macOS App Stores without Apple noticing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple pulled the app this morning after <em>The Verge</em> wrote about it, and it is no longer available.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second time in the last week that Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; has made headlines for questionable app approval. Last Thursday, popular password management app LastPass raised the alarm about a fake "LassPass" app that was imitating its design and feature set. Apple pulled the app about a day after the news was shared on media sites.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/pirated-movie-was-in-app-store/">Pirated Movie App Disguised as Vision Test Snuck Onto App Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pirated-movie-app-disguised-as-vision-test-snuck-onto-app-store.2419391/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are more than 1,000 apps available for the Vision Pro, Apple marketing chief Greg Joswiak said today. There are also more than 1.5 million <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> apps that are compatible with the Vision Pro and that are able to run on the device.<br/>
<br/>

When the Vision Pro launched, Apple said there were more than 600 apps available for the headset, so the number of apps has increased by over 400 in the weeks since the Vision Pro debuted. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A huge thank you to our developers! Their hard work has already resulted in over 1,000 incredible spatial apps designed specifically for Vision Pro, along with over 1.5 million compatible apps. We&#39;re thrilled to see how they&#39;ll continue to push the boundaries for what’s possible.</p>&mdash; Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) <a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1757533581495382496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
The Vision Pro is able to run many of the apps that are on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, but the 1,000 app count is for those that have been designed for and optimized for the headset. <br/>
