		<description><![CDATA[Apple today increased the trade-in values for some Macs, with the update coming alongside the launch of new 13-inch and 15-inch M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/mac-studio-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-841118" /><br/>
Mac users who opt to trade in an old machine can get between &#36;120 and &#36;1315, with the values increased from the prior &#36;115 to &#36;1070 range. Most of the trade-in values have seen only minor increases or have stayed the same, but the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> has driven values up.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is now offering up to &#36;1315 when trading in a &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, with the prior maximum at &#36;1070.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>MacBook Pro</strong> - Up to &#36;1000 (Up from &#36;990)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>MacBook Air</strong> - Up to &#36;550 (No change)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>MacBook</strong> - Up to &#36;160 (Up from &#36;150)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>iMac</strong> - Up to &#36;440 (No change)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>iMac Pro</strong> - Up to &#36;500 (No change)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Mac mini</strong> - Up to &#36;400 (Down from &#36;410)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Mac Studio</strong> - Up to &#36;1315 (Up from &#36;1070)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Mac Pro</strong> - Up to &#36;800 (Down from &#36;900)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Trade-in values vary based on the condition, year, and configuration of the Mac that's being traded in. Macs can be traded in toward the purchase of a new device or the value can be added toward an Apple Gift Card.<br/>
<br/>
Values for trading in other devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Apple Watch have not changed.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-trade-in/">Apple Trade-In</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-increases-mac-trade-in-prices/">Apple Ups Mac Trade-In Prices Following M3 MacBook Air Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ups-mac-trade-in-prices-following-m3-macbook-air-launch.2421047/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning a software update that will add multi-display support to the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro model, the company confirmed to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/04/14-inch-m3-macbook-pro-multi-display-support/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models that were introduced today include support for up to two 5K external displays when used in clamshell mode, a feature that is not currently available on the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the same M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919851" /><br/>
With the two machines using the same M3 chip, it was not clear why the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has the feature while the MacBook Pro does not, but it is an issue that Apple plans to rectify. In the near future, a software update will add the option for the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro to drive two external displays when the lid of the machine is closed.<br/>
<br/>
Both the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and the M3 MacBook Pro offer support for one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz when the display is open, and with the update, the M3 MacBooks will also be able to power two 5K external displays with a resolution of up to 60Hz. That is equivalent to the Studio Display, so users can expect to be able to run two of Apple's 5K displays in clamshell mode.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro models are already able to drive multiple displays, so this change only applies to the 14-inch MacBook Pro that has the M3 chip. This machine replaced the prior-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro, which Apple has now done away with.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-pro-multi-display-support/">M3 MacBook Pro to Get Multi-Display Support With Software Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-macbook-pro-to-get-multi-display-support-with-software-update.2421042/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A court in British Columbia, Canada today approved Apple's settlement related to the iPhone battery throttling controversy in 2018, according to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/apple-settlement-british-columbia-supreme-court-1.7098096"><em>CBC News</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-6s-MacRumors-YouTube.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929156" /><br/>
Apple agreed to pay up to &#36;14.4 million (CAD) to settle a class action lawsuit in Canada that alleged the company secretly throttled the performance of some iPhone models. Each affected customer who submits a claim will receive a payment of between &#36;17.50 and &#36;150 (CAD) from Apple, with the exact payout amount to be dependent on the total number of claims submitted. More information on how to submit a claim will be shared on the <a href="https://www.smartphoneperformancesettlement.ca/">settlement website</a>, but a specific timeframe has yet to be provided.<br/>
<br/>
The class includes any current or former resident of Canada (excluding Quebec) who owned and/or purchased an iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and/or iPhone SE with iOS 10.2.1 or later installed or downloaded, and/or an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 11.2 or later installed or downloaded, before December 21, 2017. A serial number will be required for each affected iPhone, according to <em>CBC News</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has denied the allegations described in the lawsuit, and the settlement does not represent an admission of fault. The settlement allows for Apple to avoid the additional time and costs involved with continued litigation.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was sued in multiple Canadian provinces over iPhone battery throttling in 2018, including Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. The cases were filed shortly after Apple revealed that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/">started throttling the maximum performance of some iPhone models with "chemically aged" batteries</a>, when necessary, to prevent the devices from unexpectedly shutting down. Apple introduced this new power management system in iOS 10.2.1, but it initially failed to mention the change in that update's release notes, leading to public outcry. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/">Apple eventually apologized</a> about its lack of transparency, and temporarily lowered the price of iPhone battery replacements to &#36;29 (USD) until the end of 2018.<br/>
<br/>
Apple agreed to pay up to &#36;500 million (USD) to settle a similar class action lawsuit in the U.S., and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/06/apple-starts-iphone-batterygate-payouts/">payments started going out in January</a> there.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/">iPhone Slowdown</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-iphone-battery-settlement-approved-in-canada/">Apple to Pay Canadian Customers Up to &#36;150 Following iPhone Throttling Controversy</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-pay-canadian-customers-up-to-150-following-iphone-throttling-controversy.2421040/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The new update comes a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-releases-visionos-1-1-beta-4/">release of the fourth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934088" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-Home-Screen.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
The &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 brings support for iMessage Contact Key Verification and it adds Apple device management to the Vision Pro. With this functionality, IT departments at companies and educational institutions can manage Vision Pro headsets in the same way they manage iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's beta notes, users can now reposition volumetric scenes closer than before, enabling easier direct interaction with the volumetric scene content. That means objects can be placed closer to you.

- Enables account-driven device and user enrollment using Managed Apple IDs<br/>
- Support for device configuration (Wi-Fi, VPN, email accounts, single sign-on, and more)<br/>
- Support for deploying apps in volume including iPhone and iPad compatible apps, visionOS apps included in a Universal purchase, and proprietary in-house visionOS apps<br/>
- Support for remote erase via MDM and device inventory data<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Messages</strong><br/>
- Adds support for iMessage Contact Key Verification<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Accessibility</strong><br/>
- Closed captions can be anchored to the playback control while viewing Apple Immersive Video<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Persona (beta) and EyeSight</strong><br/>
- Adds an option to enroll your Persona hands-free<br/>
- Improves hair and makeup appearance<br/>
- Improves neck and mouth representation<br/>
- Improves rendering of the eyes for EyeSight<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Virtual keyboard</strong><br/>
- Cursor positioning for text input is now more accurate<br/>
- Resolves some instances where the virtual keyboard placement obscures the text input field<br/>
- Fixes an issue where in some cases, the text preview on the virtual keyboard may appear out of sync with the text field in the app<br/>
- Fixes an issue where the edit menu may appear unexpectedly<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Mac Virtual Display</strong><br/>
- Improves the reliability of discovering and connecting to a Mac using Mac Virtual Display<br/>
- Resolves an issue where Universal Control may stop working<br/>
- Addresses a connectivity issue that occurs when a previously paired Bluetooth device cannot be found<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Captive Network Support</strong><br/>
- Ability to set up your device while using a captive WiFi network such as those found at hotels, cafes and airports<br/>

The RC is the finalized version of watchOS 10.4 that will see a public launch next week. <br/>
<br/>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.4‌ update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, watchOS 10.4 can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.4 includes new emoji characters such as a lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake). There is also a Setting to disable the Double Tap feature on Apple Watch when using Vision Pro, as the Double Tap gestures might be accidentally activated when controlling Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's release notes for the update are below:<blockquote>watchOS 10.4 includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes, including:<br/>
- Tap to Show Full Notification setting now allows you to double tap to expand the notification<br/>
- Using Apple Pay with Confirm with AssistiveTouch will require a passcode for additional security and will not support double clicking the side button<br/>
- Resolves an issue that causes some users to experience false touches on the display<br/>
- Fixes an issue that prevents contacts from syncing to Apple Watch for some users<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Instagram <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-dm-improvements">today announced several updates</a> for its direct messaging feature, including message editing and pinned chats. Direct messages sent on Instagram can now be edited for up to 15 minutes after sending.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/instagram-dm-editing-option.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939508" /><br/>
To edit a message, long press on it and then choose the "Edit" option. Users will see that the content has been edited, and the feature brings Instagram in line with Facebook and with Apple's own iMessage editing feature.<br/>
<br/>
Up to three chats will soon be able to pinned to the top of the message inbox, with support for both group messages and one on one conversations. Swipe left or tap and hold on a chat and choose the "pin" option to pin it to the top of the messaging interface.<br/>
<br/>
Instagram added a new toggle for disabling read receipts, which can be done for all chats or just for certain chats. The account-wide setting can be turned on in the settings section by going to Messages and then story replies.<br/>
<br/>
Along with these updates, Instagram introduced several new themes that can be activated on a per-chat basis, plus there is now an option to save favorite stickers in DMs for quicker access. Pressing and holding on a sticker allows it to be saved.<br/>
<br/>
These new features are rolling out to Instagram users starting today, and it can take some time for the options to be available for everyone.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/instagram-dm-editing-pinned-chats/">Instagram Gains Direct Message Editing, Pinned Chats and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-gains-direct-message-editing-pinned-chats-and-more.2421029/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">today</a> brought the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> up to date with its latest-generation Apple silicon. The company has reworked the lineup and its pricing, phasing out the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> machine from 2020 and discontinuing the 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; introduced in June 2023, so which model should you buy?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M2-MBA-vs-M3-MacBook-Air-Buyers-Guide-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939499" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-macbook-air/">2024 MacBook Air</a> is available in 13.6- and 15.3-inch display sizes just like its predecessor, with the smaller model starting at &#36;1,099 and the larger model starting at &#36;1,299. The 13.6-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip from 2022 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m2-macbook-air-under-1000/">remains in the lineup</a>, now at a price of &#36;999. This means that buyers have the choice between the 2022 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, its 2024 successor, and a big-screen variant of the 2024 model. It is also worth remembering that it is possible to shave at least &#36;100 off the price of a new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; directly from Apple with education pricing.<br/>
<br/>
Read on to find out about all of the differences between the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models to help you decide which model is best for you, as well as if it may be worth upgrading. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="m2_vs._m3_chip">M2 vs. M3 Chip</h3><br/>
The main upgrade offered by the &zwnj;2024 MacBook Air&zwnj; models is the M3 chip. In benchmark tests, the M3 outperforms the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ by about 17% in single-core tasks and approximately 21% in multi-core tasks. In GPU performance measured by Metal benchmarks, the M3 exhibits a notable improvement of around 15% over the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌.<br/>
<br/>

</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The M3 chip introduces an all-new GPU architecture. This architecture includes Dynamic Caching, a breakthrough feature that optimizes GPU memory allocation and utilization, adapting in real-time to varying task demands. This enhancement not only boosts graphics performance for intensive applications but also bolsters the chip's overall energy efficiency. This is particularly beneficial for graphics-heavy tasks like advanced video editing, 3D rendering, and gaming. It also features support for AV1 video decode to provide more efficient and higher-quality video from streaming services.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon-buyers-guide/">Apple Silicon Buyer's Guide: Which Chip Should You Choose?</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Despite similarities in the 16-core Neural Engine between the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ and M3, the M3's adoption of a ‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌ fabrication process leads to more efficient execution of machine learning and AI tasks. Additionally, the M3 maintains up to 24GB of unified memory, just like the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌, but leverages the new process for more efficient memory bandwidth utilization.<br/>
<br/>
One other notable difference between the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ and M3 chips is their energy efficiency. The ‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌ fabrication process enables the M3 to achieve higher performance without a proportional increase in power consumption, making the chip particularly appealing for laptop users who value a balance between power and battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/how-much-better-really-is-m3/">M2 vs. M3 Buyer's Guide: How Much Better Really Is M3?</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Overall, the M3 chip is a considerable upgrade from the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌, distinguished by its higher transistor count, improved performance in CPU and GPU tasks, and superior energy efficiency. While the M3 offers clear advancements, the extent of its superiority does not necessitate an immediate upgrade for current ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ users, especially if their existing workflows are still completed comfortably. For new buyers or those upgrading from older models, the M3's improvements in performance and efficiency will be much more pronounced.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="other_differences">Other Differences</h3><br/>
There are a number of other notable differences between the two &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; generations beyond their chips. While these upgrades are fairly small, they are worth bearing in mind when contemplating whether to get the latest model.<br/>

 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><br/>
Overall, the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is a minor upgrade over its predecessor, largely focusing on enhanced performance rather than new capabilities. Its main target audience is those who have an older &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, such as an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; or Intel-based model, or no &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; at all.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you can leverage the specific advantages of the M3 chip and require maximum performance from its highly portable form factor, it is likely not worth buying the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; over the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for most users. However, if future-proofing is a major priority because you tend to keep your computer for many years, the extra &#36;100 to get the latest model will probably be warranted. The M3 model's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-two-displays-lid-closed/">support for two external displays</a> may also justifiably swing your buying decision if you have multiple monitors.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to buy a new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; from Apple and want the larger, 15.3-inch model, then the latest M3 model is your only option as the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 15.3-inch machine has now been discontinued. That being said, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 15.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is still readily available second-hand, refurbished, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#macbook_air">from third-party retailers</a> for prices well below the &#36;1,299 price of the latest model. If you want the larger model, it may be worth seeking out one of these <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#macbook_air">deals</a> on an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; model before opting for the latest M3 machine directly from Apple. <br/>
<br/>
It is certainly not worth upgrading from the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; to the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for the overwhelming majority of customers. Upgrading from an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; to an M3 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; may be more justifiable owing to the display size increase, but there is little that the latest generation meaningfully offers over its predecessor.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2-vs-m3-macbook-air/">M2 vs. M3 MacBook Air Buyer&#039;s Guide: All Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m2-vs-m3-macbook-air-buyers-guide-all-differences-compared.2421026/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this morning <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">announced</a> new models of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air, now with the M3 chip. With Apple moving onto the next generation of MacBook Air models, we're looking back at the original 13-inch M1 MacBook Air, which is at a great all-time low price on Best Buy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/M1-MacBook-Air-Deals-Feature-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2125" height="1195" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850533" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

<br/>
You can get the 256GB 13-inch M1 MacBook Air for <a href="https://howl.me/clLm50orOos"><strong>&#36;749.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;999.99. Best Buy has this notebook in all three colors, and offers free two-day shipping to all customers. Although nearly four years old, this version of the MacBook Air still has an Apple silicon chip and should be perfect for anyone who wants to prioritize saving money over having the latest and greatest product.<br/>

		<title>All-New Apple Watch Hermès &#039;Tricot&#039; Knitted Band Released</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple and Hermès today released an all-new knitted "Tricot" Apple Watch band, available in four color options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Hermès-Tricot-Single-Tour-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939425" /><br/>
Apple describes the Tricot Single Tour as "a knitted textile band that comfortably hugs the wrist like a glove." It is available as a single tour band only.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Patterned on 1930s-era Hermès gloves created for driving, sailing, and golf, the Tricot band takes what was old and makes it new again. The continuous textile knit comfortably hugs the wrist, imparting both a freedom of movement and a sense of élan.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Hermès already sells a number of "Tricot" luxury accessories such as neckties. Unlike its main selection Tricot accessories, which tend to be made of 100% silk, the Apple Watch Hermès Tricot Single Tour is made of polyamide yarn. Polyamide is waterproof and enables the band to be used when swimming, just like all of the other non-leather Apple Watch Hermès bands.<br/>
<br/>
The Tricot Single Tour band is available in Bleu Jean, Jaune de Naples, Orange, and Beige de Weimar. It is only compatible with 38mm, 40mm, and 41mm Apple Watch models. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/hermes-tricot.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939444" /><br/>
<br/>
The Tricot Single Tour replaces the both the single and double tour Apple Watch Hermès Bridon bands on the company's main Apple Watch band webpage. The Apple Watch Hermès Bridon bands are knitted just like the Tricot, suggesting that the new band could replace it when stock runs out.<br/>
<br/>
The Bridon band is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTHQ3AM/A/apple-watch-hermès-45mm-noir-bridon-single-tour?">still available</a>, but it may only be while stocks last as a result. Apple tends to allow discontinued Apple Watch Hermès bands to sell out over a longer period of time rather than outright de-listing them. The Navy/Gris/Ciel Bridon band also continues to be available directly from Hermès, but now on a separate webpage, just like many of the leather Apple Watch Hermès bands that Apple stopped selling in September last year.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-refreshes-cases-and-watch-bands/">refresh of iPhone and Apple Watch band color options</a> earlier today, Apple and Hermès added Bleu Céleste/Écru and Framboise/Écru Color options to the Hermès Toile H Single Tour band, Bleu Céleste/Bleu Jean and Jaune d'Or/Bleu Jean color options to the Hermès Twill Jump Single Tour and, and Blanc and Bleu Céleste color options to the Hermès Kilim Single Tour band.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Hermès Tricot Single Tour band is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP93AM/A/apple-watch-hermès-41mm-orange-tricot-single-tour?fnode=2f8bb64ea4e2bafcdc01e949ab01260e2f27c6d3f637fe18cb1f10a46f8c1b133a041375d7e3ed4eef9ead783a04a78fa7cfd974ffb9147f87779a78f3a3bc24c30e2a1f4f3c5d29b2f5ee07827b36fb">now available to order</a> for &#36;349.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-hermes/">Apple Watch Hermès</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-watch-hermes-tricot-released/">All-New Apple Watch Hermès &#039;Tricot&#039; Knitted Band Released</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-new-apple-watch-hermès-tricot-knitted-band-released.2421011/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you frequently work with external displays, it's worth noting that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">just-announced</a> M3 MacBook Air models support two external displays – one more than the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the same M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-2-up-hero-240304-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939443" /><br/>
Launched last October, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip simultaneously supports one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz. <br/>
<br/>
In contrast, both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip support one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz, and two external displays with up to 5K resolution at 60Hz when the laptop lid is closed, also known as clamshell mode.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the machines use identical chips, it could be that the additional external display support on the MacBook Airs has been made at the software level. If so, there would seem to be no reason that it could not be added to the M3 MacBook Pro in a future software update. However, it could also be a hardware-based change, and we might not know for sure until a teardown is performed on the new laptops.<br/>
<br/>
The new M3-powered MacBook Air models start from &#36;1,099 and can be pre-ordered on Apple's website, with availability beginning on Friday, March 8. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip starts at &#36;1,599.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-more-external-displays/">M3 MacBook Air Supports More External Displays Than M3 MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-macbook-air-supports-more-external-displays-than-m3-macbook-pro.2421010/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple originally launched the 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip in June 2022 with a &#36;1,199 starting price, but dropped the price to &#36;1,099 in June 2023 when the 15-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip was launched.

		<description><![CDATA[The European Commission today <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1161">fined Apple</a> €1.8 billion (&#36;1.95 billion) for anti-competitive conduct against rival music streaming services. In a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/?1709553731">response</a> published on its website, Apple fiercely attacked the Commission's decision, as well as Spotify's behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
The fine comes as the conclusion to a long-running investigation by the EU, triggered by a complaint from Spotify, into Apple's treatment of third-party music streaming services on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. The Commission now says that Apple abused its dominant position in the market by forbidding music streaming apps to tell users about cheaper subscription prices outside the app.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The European Commission has fined Apple over €1.8 billion for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps to iPhone and iPad users ('iOS users') through its App Store. In particular, the Commission found that Apple applied restrictions on app developers preventing them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app ('anti-steering provisions'). This is illegal under EU antitrust rules.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
In an extensive public <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/?1709553731">response</a>, Apple noted that while Spotify has a dominant, 56 percent share of Europe's music streaming market and a "large part of their success is due to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;," the company does not pay anything to Apple because it refuses to sell subscriptions in its app. Apple listed a large number of services that it provides to Spotify for free, such as distribution, APIs, frameworks, TestFlight, App Review, and in-person engineering assistance. "But free isn't enough for Spotify," Apple says. "They also want to rewrite the rules of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; — in a way that advantages them even more."<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Instead, Spotify wants to bend the rules in their favor by embedding subscription prices in their app without using the App Store's In-App Purchase system. They want to use Apple's tools and technologies, distribute on the App Store, and benefit from the trust we’ve built with users — and to pay Apple nothing for it.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Apple said that Spotify claimed in 2015 when it started working on the investigation with the European Commission that the "digital music market had stalled, and that Apple was holding competitors back." "Unfortunately for their case, Spotify continued to grow," Apple added.<br/>
<br/>
Apple noted that three different related cases mounted against it by the European Commission over the past eight years consistently found no evidence of consumer harm and no evidence of anti-competitive behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The reality is that European consumers have more choices than ever. Ironically, in the name of competition, today's decision just cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is the digital music market's runaway leader.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Apple also said that it is set to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) within days, alluding to the release of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">iOS 17.4</a>, which includes a number of significant changes for users in Europe to meet the legislation's requirements. It believes that today's fine is "an effort by the Commission to enforce the DMA before the DMA becomes law," since it is "not grounded in existing competition law." Apple plans to appeal the decision.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">EU Fines Apple &#36;2 Billion for Anti-Competitive Behavior Toward Spotify</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-fines-apple-2-billion-for-anti-competitive-behavior-toward-spotify.2420990/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
