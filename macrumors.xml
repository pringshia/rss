		<title>Apple Launches New Safari Ad Campaign: &#039;A Browser That&#039;s Actually Private&#039;</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a new privacy-focused Safari ad, which is designed to highlight the ways that Safari protects user privacy compared to other browsers.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0HjDpPnxcP0" title="Privacy on iPhone | Flock | Apple" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
In the spot, security cameras are positioned as pesky birds and bats, hovering around smartphone users as they browse the web. The cameras are everywhere, representing website trackers. Much of the ad is focused on non-iPhone users, but toward the end, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users opens up Safari and all the creepy cameras explode in mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
The video is accompanied by billboards in cities around the world and short digital ads that are being shown on social networks. Apple has also highlighted some of the recent privacy updates made to Safari <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/15697/private-browsing-2-0/">on its WebKit blog</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Safari has long protected advertisers from tracking users across the web with cross-site tracking, and it uses Intelligent Tracking Prevention to suss out and block domains collecting tracking data.<br/>
<br/>
IP addresses are hidden from known trackers in Safari, as this can be used to identify users across websites, plus location information is not shared without express user permission and with optional time limitations. To cut down on fingerprinting, a tracking technique that uses system configuration info, Safari provides limited information to trackers to make devices look more identical.<br/>
<br/>
The Safari Private Browsing mode offers an option to use a different search engine, it strips information added to URLs for tracking purposes, it has a content blocker to block network requests from known trackers, and it restricts web extensions that have access to webpage content and browsing history.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>+ subscribers have additional protections with &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay and Safari Private Browsing, including separate sessions for every tab so sites can't tell if two tabs came from the same device and a non-specific IP location based on country and time zone.<br/>
<br/>
Tracking preventions that Apple designed specifically for Private Browsing mode are enabled by default when in that mode, but they can also be enabled for regular browsing by going to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Safari &gt; Advanced &gt; Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and toggling on the "All Browsing" feature. On a Mac, the setting can be found under Safari &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, a number of Safari's protections are not offered by other browsers such as Chrome, which makes Safari the ideal choice for privacy. Safari's unique features include using machine learning to combat cross-site tracking, removing unique trackers from URLs in Private Browsing, hiding IP address from known trackers, preventing web extensions from seeing browsing by default, not sharing location data with search engine, and blocking known trackers in Private Browsing.<br/>
<br/>
More information on Safari's privacy protections can be found on <a href="https://apple.com/privacy">Apple's privacy website</a>, with specific technical information <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/15697/private-browsing-2-0/">available on the WebKit blog</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/">Apple Privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/apple-safari-ad-campaign/">Apple Launches New Safari Ad Campaign: &#039;A Browser That&#039;s Actually Private&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-new-safari-ad-campaign-a-browser-thats-actually-private.2431496/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Wallet App Now Works With PRESTO Fare Card in Toronto Area</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2024/07/apple-and-metrolinx-introduce-presto-card-for-iphone-and-apple-watch/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.prestocard.ca/en/about/presto-in-mobile-wallet/apple">Metrolinx</a> today announced that the PRESTO card can now be added to the Wallet app, allowing commuters in Toronto, Canada and the surrounding area to tap an iPhone or Apple Watch to pay for a fare on buses, streetcars, trains, and the subway. Funds can be loaded onto the card directly in the Wallet app for added convenience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Wallet-PRESTO.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958998" /><br/>
Express Mode allows commuters to simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a payment reader to pay for their ride, without needing to unlock or wake the device. This mode even works for up to five hours after your iPhone runs out of battery power.<br/>
<br/>
Transit agencies that accept the PRESTO card in the Wallet app include the TTC and UP Express in Toronto, HSR in Hamilton, MiWay in Mississauga, Brampton Transit, Burlington Transit, Durham Region Transit, Oakville Transit, and York Region Transit, as well as the GO Transit network. The feature does not work with OC Transpo in Ottawa.<br/>
<br/>
To add the PRESTO card to the Wallet app, tap on the plus sign in the top-right corner, select Transit Card, and select PRESTO. A physical PRESTO card can also be converted for use in the Wallet app, but the physical card will no longer work. The version in the Wallet app supports various fare types, and Ontario's new One Fare program.<br/>
<br/>
Adding a PRESTO card to the Wallet app requires an iPhone 8 or later with iOS 16.4 or later, or an Apple Watch Series 4 or later with watchOS 9.4 or later.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is seemingly planning a rework of the Apple Watch lineup for 2024, according to a range of reports from over the past year. Here's everything we know so far. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
Apple is expected to continue to offer three different Apple Watch models in five casing sizes, but the various display sizes will allegedly grow by up to 12% and the casings will get taller. Based on all of the latest rumors, this is what we are expecting to change:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>Apple Watch Lineup 2023–2024</th><br/>
 <th>Apple Watch Lineup 2024–2025</th><br/>
 <th>Price</th><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><strong>Apple Watch SE (second generation)</strong><br/>
40mm casing<br/>
1.57-inch display</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Apple Watch SE (third generation)</strong><br/>

 <td>Starts at &#36;249</td><br/>

 <td><strong>Apple Watch SE (second generation)</strong><br/>

 <td><strong>Apple Watch SE (third generation)</strong><br/>
45mm casing<br/>
1.89-inch display (+6.18%)</td><br/>
 <td>Starts at &#36;279</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><strong>Apple Watch Series 9</strong><br/>
41mm casing<br/>
1.69-inch display</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Apple Watch Series 10</strong><br/>
45mm casing<br/>
1.89-inch display (+11.83%)</td><br/>
 <td>Starts at &#36;399</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><strong>Apple Watch Series 9</strong><br/>
45mm casing<br/>
1.89-inch display</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Apple Watch Series 10</strong><br/>
49mm casing<br/>
2.04-inch display (+7.94%)</td><br/>
 <td>Starts at &#36;449</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2</strong><br/>
49mm casing<br/>
1.99-inch display</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 3</strong><br/>
~52mm casing?<br/>
2.13-inch display (+7.04%)</td><br/>
 <td>Starts at &#36;799</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The first- and second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> models use the design of the Apple Watch Series 4, which was introduced in 2018. With the third generation, Apple is expected to update the SE to the design introduced with the Apple Watch Series 7 in 2021 for a more modern appearance with a larger screen and slimmer bezels.<br/>
<br/>
For Apple's main "Series" line of Apple Watches, the smallest casing size is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">discontinued</a>. The original Apple Watch and Series 1, 2, and 3 were available in a 38mm casing, and this grew to 40mm with the Series 4. With the Series 7, it grew further still to 41mm.<br/>
<br/>
This year, the larger of the two standard Apple Watch casing sizes, the 45mm model, is expected to become the smallest option. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">all-new 49mm casing size</a>, matching the current Apple Watch Ultra, is expected to be introduced as the new larger option. The 49mm Apple Watch Ultra is compatible with bands designed for the 45mm Apple Watch Series models, so it is possible that Apple Watch bands could be compatible across both Series 10 models and the Apple Watch Ultra for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
The design of the Apple Watch Series 10 is expected to be largely the same as that of the Series 9 and its other predecessors, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10/">leaked CAD renders</a>, meaning that the all-new 49mm model will be the most striking addition.<br/>
<br/>
DSCC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/07/microled-apple-watch-ultra-2025/">Ross Young</a>, Haitong International Securities's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/cheaper-airpods-and-micro-led-apple-watch-rumors/">Jeff Pu</a>, and Omdia's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/08/apple-watch-series-x-larger-display-rumor/">David Hsieh</a> have claimed that the next-generation Apple Watch Ultra will feature a larger 2.13-inch display, but it is worth noting that many of these reports related to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled-for-now/">now-canceled</a> introduction of a microLED display. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> says that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">no design changes</a> are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3, so the larger display size is far from certain and it could in reality have the same casing and display size as the current model.<br/>
<br/>
If the rumors pan out, all of the 2024 Apple Watch models will be larger than the models they replace in the lineup. New features for the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 include the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">S10 chip with AI enhancements</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/2024-apple-watch-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea/">hypertension detection, and sleep apnea detection</a>. The entire new Apple Watch lineup is expected to be announced in the fall as usual alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/2024-apple-watch-lineup-key-changes/">2024 Apple Watch Lineup: Key Changes We&#039;re Expecting</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2024-apple-watch-lineup-key-changes-were-expecting.2431492/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Smart home company Lutron today announced a few new additions to its <a href="https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/products/dimmers-switches">Caséta line of products</a>, expanding the range of lighting options available to consumers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lutron-smart-dimmer.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958804" /><br/>
For professional installers, there is now a Diva smart dimmer with ELV+ technology, offering smart control for low-voltage applications like under-cabinet lighting, track lights, and accent lights. The dimmer works with ELV devices and with nearly all residential lighting types and loads, such as LED, MLV, incandescent, and halogen.<br/>
<br/>
Like the Smart Dimmer Switch for ELV+ Lighting, the Diva version uses phase-selectable dimming to enable dimming across a range of load types. Installers can select between forward or reverse-phase dimming in the Lutron app or when installing the light.<br/>
<br/>
The Diva smart dimmer with ELV+ is available in white, ivory, light almond, black, brown, and gray to match other switches and outlets in the home.<br/>
<br/>
Lutron is also introducing new color options for the Pico Paddle Remote, which was previously only available in white. The Pico Paddle Remote now comes in white, ivory, light almond, black, brown, and gray, much like other Caséta accessories.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lutron-pico-paddle-colors.jpg" alt="" width="1112" height="623" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958805" /><br/>
The Pico Paddle Remote can control Caséta smart switches and dimmers and Serena smart shades and fans, adding extra control options for lights and smart home products. The Pico Paddle Remotes have a 10-year battery life and do not require a hub, app, or Wi-Fi for operation.<br/>
<br/>
The Diva smart dimmer ELV+ and new Pico Paddle Remote options <a href="https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/products/dimmers-switches">are available through</a> electrical distributors and online retailers that carry Caséta controls.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lutron/">Lutron</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/lutron-elv-diva-smart-dimmer/">Lutron Debuts New Diva Smart Dimmer With ELV+, Additional Pico Paddle Remote Colors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lutron-debuts-new-diva-smart-dimmer-with-elv-additional-pico-paddle-remote-colors.2431490/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Beats brand has done a number of collaborations over the years with fashion designers, artists, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/16/mickey-mouse-beats-solo-3-headphones/">and even Disney</a>, and the latest partnership is with Minecraft for <a href="https://beatsbydre.com/headphones/solo4-wireless/MYJ03/solo4-chargedblack">special-edition Beats Solo 4 headphones</a> in recognition of the game's 15th anniversary.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/beats-solo-4-minecraft-green.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958792" /><br/>
Functionally, these are the same Solo 4 on-ear headphones that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-4-launch/">debuted several months ago</a>, but they come in a unique Minecraft-themed design with the Minecraft text logo on the top of the headband and neon green Minecraft pixelated patterns and accents across the remainder of the band and the outside of the ear cups. Even the iconic Beats "b" logo button for controlling media is in neon green, and there's a hidden neon green creeper on the inside of the headband.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/beats-solo-4-minecraft-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958794" /><br/>
Minecraft branding extends to the case for the Solo 4 headphones, with the Beats logo and raised Minecraft pixelated patterns in neon green on the front panel. As with the standard versions of the Solo 4 headphones, the nylon case zips open to allow the folded headphones to slide in, and there are small pockets inside for the included USB-C to USB-C and 3.5mm to 3.5mm cables.<br/>
<br/>

With the purchase of the Beats x Minecraft Special Edition Solo 4 headphones, customers will also receive a unique code that can be redeemed for an in-game headphone character creator item in Minecraft.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/beats-minecraft-characters.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958793" /><br/>
As a refresher, the Beats Solo 4 on-ear headphones support Bluetooth, wired USB-C, and wired 3.5mm connections, as well as support for Personalized Spatial Audio. They offer up to 50 hours of battery life when connected via Bluetooth, and a Fast Fuel charge gives you up to five hours of playback with just ten minutes of charging. There's no active noise cancelation included, but the on-ear design does help to block out a decent amount of ambient sound.<br/>
<br/>
A proprietary Beats chip platform offers tight integration for both iOS and Android users, including support for one-touch pairing, automatic setup across devices via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> or Google, and support for Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> and Android's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Device services. iOS users also get access to always-on "Hey <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>" functionality and support for Audio Sharing.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is back with its annual <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime">summertime Prime Day event</a>, lasting for just two days from July 16-17. As it does every year, Prime Day offers shoppers a huge selection of deals across Amazon's storefront, including savings on tech, clothing, video games, groceries, and much, much more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/primeday2020_feature3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-763521" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
For our coverage, we're focusing entirely on discounts for Apple and Apple-related products that can be purchased right now on Amazon. As of today, this includes deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook Air, and more. We're also sharing deals being matched at retailers like Best Buy in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
As is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated over the next few days, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles next week.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon Prime Day requires you to have an <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime membership</strong></a> to take advantage of the discounts. Amazon Prime costs &#36;14.99 per month or &#36;139.00 per year, and it comes with a 30-day free trial for new subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/airpods-prime-day-24.jpg" alt="" width="2002" height="1126" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958559" /><br/>
<br/>
Starting with AirPods, you'll find a wide selection of solid deals across the AirPods lineup on Amazon during Prime Day. Prices start at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;69.00</strong></a> for the AirPods 2 (&#36;60 off), then increase to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;168.99</strong></a> for the AirPods Pro 2 (&#36;80 off).<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has made available the first betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to public beta testers, opening up the new software to the general public for the first time since the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Keep reading to learn how to prepare your device for the beta software and install it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Public-Beta-Thumb-1.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958424" /><br/>
Signing up to get the ‌iOS 18‌ or ‌iPadOS 18 beta is simple, and can be done by enrolling an iPhone or iPad in Apple's free Apple Beta Software Program. The steps you need to complete to install the software on your device are provided towards the end of this article, but before you jump ahead, here are a few things worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Is My iPhone Compatible With iOS 18?</h2><br/>
iOS 18 is compatible with the same iPhone models as iOS 17, so that includes the following devices:<br/>
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;"><br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 15</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Plus</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Plus</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro Max</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 13</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 13 mini</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 13 Pro</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 13 Pro Max</li></ul></div><div style="float: right; width: 50%;"><br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>iPhone 12</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 12 mini</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 12 Pro</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 12 Pro Max</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 11</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 11 Pro</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 11 Pro Max</li><br/>
<li>iPhone XS</li><br/>
<li>iPhone XS Max</li><br/>
<li>iPhone XR</li><br/>
<li>iPhone SE (2nd generation)</li><br/>
<li>iPhone SE (3rd generation)</li></ul></div><br/>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>iPadOS 18 drops support for iPad models with the A10X Fusion chip</a>, used in the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The sixth-generation iPad is also being dropped from the compatibility list, but the seventh-generation iPad is still supported. That means iPadOS 18 is compatible with the following iPad models:<br/>
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;"><ul><li>iPad Pro: 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li>iPad Air: 2019 and later</li></ul></div><div style="float: right; width: 50%;"><br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>iPad mini: 2019 and later</li><br/>
<li>iPad: 2020 and later</li></ul></div><br/>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>If you're unsure which ‌iPad‌ model you have, go to <strong>Settings -> General -> About</strong>, and you'll find the Model Name listed there.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Should I Install iOS 18 Public Beta?</h2><br/>
Before downloading the update, it's worth noting that Apple does not recommend installing the iOS 18 Beta on your main iPhone, so if you have a secondary device, use that. This is beta software, which means there are often bugs and issues that pop up that can prevent software from working properly or cause other problems. If you're concerned about potential issues, hold off on installing and wait for Apple to launch its final stable release later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<div id="backup"></div><h2>Make an Archived Backup of Your Device First</h2><br/>
Before installing the beta, make sure to <strong>back up your iOS device</strong> before installing the software using the following method, otherwise you won't be able to revert back to iOS 17 if things go wrong.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Plug your iPhone into your Mac using the supplied cable.</li><br/>
<li>Allow the accessory to connect by clicking <strong>Allow</strong> in the dialog prompt.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open a <strong>Finder</strong> window by clicking the Finder icon in the Dock.</li><br/>
 	<li>Click your iOS device's name in the sidebar.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/archived-backup2.jpg" alt="finder" width="2264" height="1592" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901467" /><br/>
 	<li>If this is the first time connecting your device to your Mac, click <strong>Trust</strong> in the Finder window.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/archived-backup1.jpg" alt="finder" width="2030" height="1408" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901468" /><br/>
 	<li>Tap <strong>Trust</strong> on your device when prompted, then enter your passcode to confirm.</li><br/>
 	<li>In the General tab, click the circle next to where it says <strong>Back up all of the data on your iPad to this Mac</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>If you want to encrypt the backup, check the box next to <strong>Encrypt local backup</strong>, then enter a password to protect your data.</li><br/>
 	<li>If you don't want to create an encrypted backup, or you've already set up encrypted backups, click <strong>Back Up Now</strong>. When the backup is finished, you can find the date and time of the last backup in the <strong>General</strong> tab, just above the Manage Backups button. <br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/archived-backup3.jpg" alt="finder" width="1990" height="1364" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901469" /><br/>
<li>Lastly, archive the backup: Select <strong>Manage Backups ➝ Select Backup</strong>, then right-click the backup and choose <strong>Archive</strong>.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Remember that this backup will not be overwritten when you manually or automatically back up your iPhone in the future, so you can restore it at any time by using the <strong>Restore Backup...</strong> option in the same Finder screen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Download iOS 18 Public Beta</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/apple-beta-software-program.jpg" alt="" width="2774" height="1494" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958873" /><ol><br/>
 	<li>On your iOS device, open up Safari and navigate to the <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">Apple Beta Software Program website</a>.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap the <strong>Sign up</strong> button and enter your Apple ID credentials, or sign in with your Apple ID if you've signed up to beta test a previous update.</li><br/>
 	<li>Agree to the Apple Beta Software Program terms and conditions if required.</li><br/>
 	<li>After signing in, you'll see a main screen that's a Guide for Public Betas. Click on <strong>iOS</strong> (or <strong>iPadOS</strong> if you're installing on an iPad).</li><br/>
 	<li>Read through Apple's instructions carefully, and then using the link in the "Get Started" section, select <strong>enroll your iOS device</strong>.</li><br/>
 	<li>Make sure to make an archived backup of your current version of iOS using Finder by following Apple's instructions or using our tutorial above. This will allow you to downgrade back to iOS 17 if necessary and is crucial if you don't enjoy the iOS 18 testing experience.</li><br/>
 	<li>Now on your iOS or iPadOS device, go to <strong>Settings -> General -> Software Update -> Beta Update</strong>, then choose the iOS 18 public beta you'd like to install.</li><br/>
<li>Once the beta update has been downloaded you can tap <strong>Install Now</strong> to get it set up, and from there, the iPhone will install the software, restart, and you'll be up and running with the iOS 18 software.</li></ol>Note that if your device is running iOS 16.3 or earlier, you'll need to download the iOS 18 configuration profile after enrolling. On your iPhone, go to <a href="http://beta.apple.com/profile">beta.apple.com/profile</a> to download the configuration profile. Your iPhone will notify you when the profile has been downloaded. Open <strong>Settings</strong>, tap the profile and follow the onscreen instructions to allow installation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 Features</h2><br/>
‌iOS 18 introduces Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features deeply integrated into the operating system. While not all functionalities are available yet, it includes Writing Tools for rewriting, polishing, proofreading, and summarizing text across apps. You can also generate custom images with Image Playground and create custom emojis through the Genmoji feature. Additionally, Siri is undergoing a complete overhaul. However, note that Apple Intelligence is not yet active in the beta versions.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the AI features (which will be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro models and M-series iPads), ‌iOS 18‌ introduces a redesigned Home Screen that allows for rearranging app icons and widgets with open spaces. It also includes a tint option and new darker colors for Dark Mode.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/downgrade-from-ios-17-to-ios-17/"><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/downgrade-from-ios-18-beta-to-ios-17/">How to Downgrade From the iOS 18 Beta to iOS 17</a></a></li></ul><br/>
Control Center has been revamped, allowing you to pick and choose what you want to feature from the new Controls Gallery. With multiple pages available, you can group related controls and customize their sizes. Additionally, the Flashlight and Camera icons on the Lock Screen can be swapped out, and you can select Control Center options for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Action Button.<br/>
<br/>
Safari now features a summary view of webpages, allowing you to see key information at a glance. The Photos app has been revamped to highlight your best images more effectively.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available in a new "Rose" color, claims a rumor out of China, corroborating previous claims.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Left-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928696" /><br/>
Chinese Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6315816381/OnJaKmDOi">OvO Baby Sauce OvO</a>, a relatively new source of supply chain leaks, said on Tuesday that the new color code for the iPhone 16 Pro models is simply "Rose," not the previous "Rose Gold" color that Apple first offered back in 2015 for the iPhone 6S. <br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/iphone-16-lineup-to-come-in-these-two-new-colors/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the iPhone 16 Pro and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max are expected to be available in black, white or silver, gray or "Natural Titanium," and rose. Kuo's prediction mirrored an <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1772522408144191732?s=20">earlier rumor</a> from the same Weibo source, claiming that the existing Blue Titanium color will be dropped from the ‌‌iPhone 16 Pro‌‌ lineup in favor of a new "rose" titanium color.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Kuo believes the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus will apparently be offered in black, green, pink, blue, and white. The iPhone 15 and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus are available in black, green, pink, blue, and yellow. This means that white will replace yellow, with the colors remaining the same.<br/>

Kuo mentioned that Apple might rename some of the existing colors, similar to how "White" on the iPhone 12 was changed to "Starlight" on the iPhone 13. Even if the color names remain the same, the actual tone and appearance might still differ. The ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup is anticipated to be announced in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/iphone-16-pro-rose-color-coming/">iPhone 16 Pro Again Rumored to Come in New &#039;Rose&#039; Color</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-again-rumored-to-come-in-new-rose-color.2431477/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reports that next year's iPhone 17 will adopt TSMC's next-generation 2nm process are "fake news," a reputable source of accurate predictions about Apple's plans claimed on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-silicon-feature-joeblue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945652" /><br/>
According to a post by Weibo user "Phone Chip Expert," the 2nm process won't go into mass production until the end of 2025. The account holder, who claims to have 25 years of experience in the integrated circuit industry, including work on Intel's Pentium processors, suggests the iPhone 17 will therefore still use TSMC's 3nm process. <br/>
<br/>
"The 2nm process won't be mass-produced until the end of 2025, so the iPhone 17 definitely can't catch up," read a machine translation of Phone Chip Expert's <a href="https://weibo.com/1833340431/OnJ3ojmDk">post</a>. "It won't be until the iPhone 18 that a 2nm processor will be used." <br/>
<br/>
"Anyone who has seen the capacity planning chart will know that this is yet another report from an unscrupulous media outlet," added the user, commenting on an article by <em><a href="https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20240715A05A7900">Zhitong Finance</a></em> that repeated claims recently made by Taiwanese newspapers based on "industry sources." <br/>
<br/>
TSMC plans to begin volume production of 2nm chips next year, but multiple reports out of Taiwan suggested that the company had been accelerating the process ahead of schedule to secure a stable yield for mass production. Apple is TSMC's main client, and it is typically the first to get TSMC's new chips. Apple acquired all of TSMC's 3nm chips in 2023 for iPhones, iPads, and Macs, for example.<br/>
<br/>
The 2nm fabrication process, also known simply as "N2," is expected to offer a 10 to 15 percent speed improvement at the same power or a 25 to 30 percent power reduction at the same speed compared to chips made with the supplier's ‌3nm‌ technology. The A17 Pro chip in Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models is manufactured with TSMC's first-generation 3nm process, known as N3B. Apple's M4 chip, which recently debuted in the new iPad Pro, uses an enhanced version of this ‌3nm‌ technology.<br/>
<br/>
Code in iOS 18 has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/iphone-16-models-a18-chip/">confirmed</a> that all four iPhone 16 models are set to use Apple's next-generation A18 chip, based on TSMC's N3E process. N3E is TSMC's second-generation 3nm chip fabrication process, which is less expensive and has improved yield compared to TSMC's first-generation 3nm process. <br/>
<br/>
The Weibo user contesting claims that 2nm will be ready for the iPhone 17 has a track record of accurate predictions. Phone Chip Expert was the first to reveal that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/28/iphone-7-already-rumored-to-be-waterproof/">iPhone 7 would be water-resistant</a> and that the standard iPhone 14 models would continue to use the A15 Bionic chip, while the more advanced A16 chip would be exclusive to the ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro models. These forecasts were later confirmed by multiple credible sources and were proven correct when the products were released.<br/>

More recently, Phone Chip Expert was the first source of information about Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/">developing its own AI server processor using TSMC's 3nm process</a>, targeting mass production by the second half of 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phone-chip-expert/">Phone Chip Expert</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2nm/">2nm</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/iphone-17-unlikely-to-get-2nm-chip/">Next Year&#039;s iPhone 17 Unlikely to Feature TSMC&#039;s First 2nm Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-years-iphone-17-unlikely-to-feature-tsmcs-first-2nm-chip.2431471/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 18 Adds &#039;Recovered&#039; Album in Photos to Restore Lost or Damaged Photos and Videos</title>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg" alt="" width="836" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897381" /><br/>
There is a "Recovered" album in the Utilities section of &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, and it shows up if there are pictures or videos on a user's device that are not part of their &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; Library. If you see the Recovered album in your &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app, tapping into it will provide an option to permanently delete or restore any pictures or video stored in the album.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Photos&zwnj; and videos can be lost due to database corruption issues, images taken with a camera app that did not properly get saved to the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; library, or third-party apps that are provided with access to manage a Photo Library. Here's how to recover a lost image or video:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Open the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app and tap into Albums.</li><br/>
 	<li>Scroll down to Utilities, and choose the Recovered album.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on a photo or video in the album, or use Select to select multiple items.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on Permanently Delete or Restore to Library.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
When upgrading to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, or &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac will automatically scan for photos and videos that are able to be recovered, providing immediate access to any missing content.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Recovered album only shows up in the Utilities section of the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app if lost photos or videos are located on a device. If there are none, you will not see the album.<br/>
<br/>
With iOS 17.5.1 and iPadOS 17.5.1, there was a fix for an unusual bug related to a database corruption issue. After installing iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5, some users saw long-deleted images reappearing in their Photo Library. Apple later said this was due to a database corruption issue that had caused the photos to reappear even after being deleted.<br/>
<br/>
The Recovered album feature in the latest software updates should prevent something like this from happening again, while also giving users access to photos and videos that are in limbo.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; betas are available to developers and public beta testers at this time. The software updates will see a public launch this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/ios-18-recovered-album-photos/">iOS 18 Adds &#039;Recovered&#039; Album in Photos to Restore Lost or Damaged Photos and Videos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-adds-recovered-album-in-photos-to-restore-lost-or-damaged-photos-and-videos.2431439/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today provided the first betas of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> to public beta testers, bringing the new software to the general public for the first time since the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Apple has seeded three developer betas so far, and the first public beta includes the same content that's in the third developer beta.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PixQ3st8R7I" title="iOS 18 Public Beta Out Now! (So Many NEW Features)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Public beta testers who have <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">signed up for Apple's beta testing program</a> can download the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; updates by opening up the Settings app, going to General, tapping into the Software Update section and selecting the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; Public Beta option.<br/>
<br/>
Note that betas can have bugs, battery issues, and other complications, so it is wise to install the software on a secondary device or make a backup in case you need to downgrade back to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, which are AI features deeply integrated into the operating system. Not all functionality is available at this time, but it brings Writing Tools for rewriting, polishing, proofreading, and summarizing text across apps, and you can generate custom images with Image Playground. There are custom emoji available through the Genmoji feature, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is getting entirely overhauled. Note that Apple Intelligence isn't yet live in the betas. <br/>
<br/>

Along with the AI features (which will be limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and M-series iPads), &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; brings a redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> with the option to rearrange app icons and widgets with open spaces, plus there's a tint option and new darker colors for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a>.<br/>

Control Center has been revamped and you can pick and choose what you want to have front and center from the new Controls Gallery. There are multiple pages so you can group related controls, and you can customize sizes. As part of this update, the Flashlight and Camera icons on the Lock Screen can be swapped out, and you can also choose Control Center options for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Action Button.<br/>
<br/>

The Messages app supports scheduling texts, you can use any emoji for the Tapback feature, and you can send messages via satellite. There are text effects you can use for any word, phrase, or emoji, plus formatting like bold and italic is an option. For texts with Android users, Apple now supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>, which basically means you won't run into issues with sending images and files, plus you can see typing indicators and read receipts and send texts over Wi-Fi.<br/>

Safari is able to summarize webpages and show you important info at a glance, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app has been overhauled to focus more on surfacing your best photos. A dedicated Passwords app makes it easier to get to your saved passwords and logins, and you can now lock any app with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> update to its public beta testing group, giving the general public a chance to try out the new operating system's features ahead of its fall launch. The first public beta includes the same content as the third developer beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-iphone-mirroring.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956750" /><br/>
Public beta testers can download &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; from the Software Update section of the System Settings app after <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">signing up on Apple's beta testing website</a> and opting into the public beta under the Beta Updates section.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;'s biggest feature is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, which is designed to let you control your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from your Mac using your keyboard and mouse. You can see notifications and use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps even when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is tucked away and locked, and later this year, you'll be able to use the feature to drag and drop apps from your Mac to your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
Window tiling has been improved to make it easier to get multiple windows on your Mac in a way that works for you, Safari can summarize websites and show you highlights, and the Messages app supports scheduling messages and using the Tapback feature with any emoji.<br/>
<br/>
There's a new Passwords app for managing your passwords, logins, and passkeys, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app has a new design, the Notes app supports audio transcription and summarization, and you can also type in any equation and get it solved automatically.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; supports all of the new Apple Intelligence features that are also coming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, offering all kinds of quality of life improvements.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a> to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to give the new features a try ahead of when the software launches this fall.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchos-11-vitals.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957264" /><br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; can be downloaded after signing up on <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">Apple's beta software website</a> and upgrading your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to the public beta version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. You'll need to open up the Watch app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, go to General, select Software Update, and choose the &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; Public Beta option under Beta Updates.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj;, Apple added a new Vitals app that can be used to give you a daily overview of your health metrics, letting you know if anything is out of the ordinary. It compares information collected at night like heart rate, sleep, respiratory rate, and oxygen level to your levels over the previous weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Smart Stack has new widgets like Translate and Shazam, plus it's smarter because it is able to suggest widgets based on time, date, location, and daily routine. Interactive widgets let you access app features from the Smart Stack, and it also supports Live Activities.<br/>
<br/>
Training Load is a new way of measuring how the intensity and duration of workouts impact the body over time, with Apple providing an effort level for cardio-based workouts to help you know when to rest and when to push harder.<br/>
<br/>
You can now customize your Activity Ring requirements for different days of the week, and Apple added support for rest days. Taking a break from activity will no longer ruin a streak because you can pause for a day, a week, a month, or more.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include more workout types, Check In for Messages, a revamped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> watch face, improvements to Double Tap, and more, with additional information <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">available in our watchOS 11 roundup</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/watchos-11-public-beta/">Apple Releases First watchOS 11 Public Beta With Vitals App and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-first-watchos-11-public-beta-with-vitals-app-and-more.2431428/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first public beta of tvOS 18, giving the general public a chance to try out the new features ahead of the software's fall launch.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-796083" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-design-triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Public beta testers can download the tvOS 18 beta by opening up the Settings app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, choosing the Software Updates section under System, and then toggling on the Get Public Beta Updates option. Signing up on <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">Apple's public beta website</a> is required to get the option to show up.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 18 isn't as feature rich as some of Apple's other updates, but it brings a new InSight feature to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app. InSight is similar to Amazon X-Ray, providing real-time information about actors, music, and more in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> shows and movies.<br/>
<br/>
The Enhanced Dialogue feature uses computational audio and machine learning to better boost vocal clarity over background noise and music, plus it works with built-in TV speakers, AirPods, and other Bluetooth devices. Subtitles have been tweaked to show up automatically when relevant, such as when the TV is muted.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added new screen savers and made it easier to swap between them, plus there's 21:9 aspect ratio support for projectors and an option for Live Captions during <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 18 is limited to public beta testers and developers right now, but it will see a public launch this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-seeds-first-tvos-18-public-beta/">Apple Seeds First tvOS 18 Public Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-tvos-18-public-beta.2431430/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The revised third beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> that Apple released today eliminates the emoji and sticker changes that Apple introduced with the initial third beta release.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-emoji-stickers-memoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957882" /><br/>
In the prior beta, stickers behaved like emoji and could be added right inline with your messages, rather than only being available as large, stand alone message additions or drag and drop add-ons to texts. You could type a message and add a little sticker or Memoji to the end of it rather than an emoji, but Apple has pulled back this change, along with the interface changes that were introduced.<br/>
<br/>
Emoji, Memoji, and stickers were all combined, and could be navigated using small icons at the bottom of the emoji picker, plus emoji were displayed larger than before, with fewer on a single screen. Apple added dedicated sections for stickers and Memoji rather than showing stickers only in the Recents section, and both stickers and Memoji could be created from the emoji window. It was a design that made both Memoji and stickers quicker to access and use.<br/>
<br/>
With the revised version of beta 3, the emoji picker has been reverted to the beta 2 design. It's not clear why Apple made the change, but it's likely temporary. Sometimes Apple adds features in the beta and then pulls them to implement further refinements before reintroducing them at a later time, so we could see the emoji picker changes re-added in a later beta.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/ios-18-beta-3-emoji-changes-reverted/">Revised iOS 18 Beta 3 Reverts Emoji Changes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/revised-ios-18-beta-3-reverts-emoji-changes.2431423/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
