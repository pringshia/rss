		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-macbook-pro-models/">new MacBook Pro models</a> feature longer battery life thanks to the efficiency enhancements of the M4 family of chips, with some models and configurations reaching up to 24 hours—the longest ever offered in a Mac.<br/>
<br/>

The biggest improvements come to models configured with either the M4 or M4 Pro chip, with M4 Max models seeing either the same or slightly worse battery life than their predecessors. The battery life of the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models compared to models from the past three years are listed below:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-macbook-pro-models/">new MacBook Pro models</a> are available with a nano-texture display option—the first time the option has ever been available on an Apple laptop.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-lifestyle-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-974061" /><br/>
First introduced with the Pro Display XDR in 2019, nano-texture glass is etched at a nanometer scale, which is meant to preserve image quality while scattering ambient light to cut down on glare. It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The new MacBook Pro introduces an all-new nano-texture display option that dramatically reduces glare and distractions from reflections. In bright lighting conditions, the new MacBook Pro can now show SDR content at up to 1,000 nits and still displays HDR content at up to 1,600 nits of peak brightness. All together, it’s a game-changing experience for users working outdoors.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/nano-texture-display-returns-to-imac/">reintroduced</a> the nano-texture display option to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>'s nano-texture glass is a build-to-order option that costs &#36;150, configurable at the point of purchase. It is now available across the Pro Display XDR, Studio Display, &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today in its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/new-macbook-pro-features-m4-family-of-chips-and-apple-intelligence/">new MacBook Pro press release</a> announced that the MacBook Air lineup now starts with 16GB of RAM, up from 8GB previously.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m3-macbook-air-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952247" /><br/>
This change applies to the 13-inch model with the M2 chip, the 13-inch model with the M3 chip, and the 15-inch model with the M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., the MacBook Air lineup continues to start at &#36;999, so there is no price increase associated with the boost in RAM.<br/>
<br/>
Apple:<blockquote>MacBook Air is the world's most popular laptop, and with Apple Intelligence, it's even better. Now, models with M2 and M3 double the starting memory to 16GB, while keeping the starting price at just &#36;999 — a terrific value for the world's best-selling laptop.</blockquote>In addition, the highest-end configurations of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip now include 24GB of RAM at no extra cost, as part of a corresponding lineup adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
No other changes beyond RAM were announced for the MacBook Air today.<br/>
<br/>
This increase comes after Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/">new iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-14-inch-macbook-pro-with-m4-chip/">base 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> models this week with a minimum of 16GB of RAM as well, ending the 8GB era.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-ram/">Apple Announces MacBook Air Now Starts With Increased 16GB of RAM With No Price Increase</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-macbook-air-now-starts-with-increased-16gb-of-ram-with-no-price-increase.2441450/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-m4-pro-and-m4-max/">today announced</a> the M4 Max chip alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-macbook-pro-models/">new MacBook Pro models</a>—its most advanced and powerful Apple silicon chip to date.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-M4-chip-series-hero.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-974011" /><br/>
Like the M4 chip introduced in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and the M4 Pro chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/">unveiled yesterday</a> in the redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, the M4 Max chips are fabricated with TSMC's enhanced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> (N3E) process. Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji said:<blockquote>Apple silicon has taken the Mac to unprecedented heights, and the rapid pace of innovation continues with M4 Pro and M4 Max. With the world's fastest CPU core, immensely more powerful GPUs, and the fastest Neural Engine ever, the power-efficient performance and capabilities of the M4 family extend its lead as the most advanced lineup of chips in the industry.</blockquote>The M4 Max's 16-core CPU contains 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores, making it 2.2x faster than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/">M1 Max</a>. The GPU contains up to 40 cores for performance up to 1.9x faster than the &zwnj;M1 Max&zwnj;. The M4 Max supports up to 128GB of unified memory with up to 546GB/s of memory bandwidth. The chip also contains an enhanced Media Engine with two video encode engines and two ProRes accelerators. Like the M4 Pro chip, the M4 Max supports Thunderbolt 5 with up to 120Gb/s data transfer capability. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-m4-pro-and-m4-max/">drew attention</a> to the M4 and M4 Pro chip, with the M4 Max completing the new chip lineup.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/new-macbook-pro-features-m4-family-of-chips-and-apple-intelligence/">announced</a> new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models featuring M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, alongside a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-14-inch-macbook-pro-with-m4-chip/">new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> powered by the M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2743" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974008" /><br/>
The new M4 Pro and M4 Max machines come with a minimum of 24GB of Unified Memory as standard, up from 18GB in the previous models. Both models feature three Thunderbolt 5 ports, the newest specification of Thunderbolt that offers speeds of up to 120 Gb/s with Bandwidth Boost, which is triple the maximum bandwidth of Thunderbolt 4. <br/>
<br/>
The new standard also features support for native DisplayPort 2.1 output over USB‑C. Thunderbolt 5 is fully compatible with USB4, and supports advanced protocols such as PCIe 4.0, allowing faster data access speeds for storage devices and peripherals.<br/>
<br/>
M4 Pro features a 14-core CPU with 10 performance cores and four efficiency cores, along with up to a 20-core GPU that is twice as powerful as M4, according to Apple. With M4 Pro, the new MacBook Pro 75% increase in memory bandwidth over the prior generation. The new MacBook Pro with M4 Pro is also up to 3x faster than models with M1 Pro, says Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 Max model features up to a 16-core CPU, up to a 40-core GPU, over half a terabyte per second of unified memory bandwidth, and a Neural Engine that is over 3x faster than M1 Max. With M4 Max, MacBook Pro delivers up to 3.5x the performance of M1 Max, according to Apple. The M4 Max also supports up to 128GB of unified memory.<br/>
<br/>
All models include an improved Liquid Retina XDR display thanks to an all-new nano-texture display option, offering up to 1000 nits of brightness for SDR content. There's also a new 12MP Center Stage camera, which Apple says delivers enhanced video quality in challenging lighting conditions. The new camera also supports Desk View, which shows both your face and the desk immediately below. The M4 Pro model offers up to 22 hours of battery life, while the M4 Max model offers up to 18 hours.<br/>

All MacBook Pro models feature an HDMI port that supports up to 8K resolution. The M4 Pro model is able to support up to three 6K displays at 60Hz over Thunderbolt or HDMI, an improvement over the previous M3 Pro model. Apple's M4 Pro chip alternatively supports one display at 6K resolution over 60Hz and a second display at 8K resolution at 60Hz or 4K resolution at 240Hz. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the M4 Max model supports up to three external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI, or up to two external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or one external display with 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, both models come with a SDXC card slot, a MagSafe 3 port for charging, and a headphone jack, along with support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-macbook-pro-models/">higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips</a>, Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/new-macbook-pro-features-m4-family-of-chips-and-apple-intelligence/">announced</a> a handful of upgrades for the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro, including the standard M4 chip, a minimum of 16GB of RAM instead of 8GB, an additional Thunderbolt port, a Space Black color option, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
In the base 14-inch MacBook Pro, the M4 chip is available with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, and it has a 16-core Neural Engine for Apple Intelligence. For the 10-core CPU, there are four performance cores and six efficiency cores. Memory bandwidth has increased to 120 Gbps for this model, up from 100 Gbps previously.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-debuts-m4-chip/">introduced the M4 chip in the iPad Pro</a> earlier this year, and in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/">the new iMac</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> models this week. Geekbench 6 benchmark results showed the M4 chip is up to 25% faster than the M3 chip in the iPad Pro, and performance improvements should be similar for Macs with the M4 chip compared to previous models with the M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Just like the new iMac, the base model 14-inch MacBook Pro now comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM, compared to 8GB for previous models. The base model is now available with up to 32GB of RAM, up from the previous 24GB limit.<br/>
<br/>
Storage capacity options remain 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB.<br/>
<br/>
The base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro is now equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, whereas the previous model has two Thunderbolt 3 ports. The laptop now supports up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution, even when the lid is open.<br/>
<br/>
The base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro can now be configured with a nano-texture display, which has a special coating that better scatters light to further minimize glare on the screen. And the base model's display brightness has also increased from 600 nits to 1,000 nits for standard non-HDR content in outdoor environments, according to Apple's tech specs.<br/>
<br/>
The base model also gets an upgraded 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage support to keep you centered in the frame, and a Desk View feature can show others your face and an overhead view of your desk at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the MacBook Pro now offers up to 24 hours of battery life for "video streaming," the "longest ever in a Mac."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has made the darker Space Black finish available for the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro this year, alongside Silver. Space Black was previously exclusive to 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models configured with M3 Pro or M3 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
The base model 14-inch MacBook Pro has no major external design changes, and some specs are the same as the previous model, such as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. In addition to three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port and an SD card slot remain.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the new MacBook Pro models are available to pre-order starting today, and they will launch in many countries on Friday, November 8. In the U.S., the base 14-inch MacBook Pro continues to start at &#36;1,599.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://protonvpn.com">Proton</a> today released its <a href="https://protonvpn.com/blog/apple-tv-app/">native Apple TV app</a>, allowing users to access VPN services directly on their Apple TV following tvOS 17's introduction of built-in VPN support last year. The company has also announced compatibility with Apple Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/proton-vpn-appletv.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974004" /><br/>
The new tvOS app enables users to connect to ProtonVPN's network of over 8,500 servers across 112 countries, providing access to geo-restricted content while maintaining privacy from internet service providers. The interface has been specifically designed for television screens, according to the company, and features larger icons and remote control optimization for comfortable viewing on a television.<br/>
<br/>
David Peterson, general manager of ProtonVPN, noted that the Apple TV app was "one of the most expected and requested features" from their community. The service promises 4K streaming capabilities without buffering or throttling.<br/>
<br/>
The app is available to subscribers with paid plans, including Proton VPN Plus, Proton Unlimited, and Proton Visionary. Users can download the app directly from the App Store on their Apple TV. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/proton/">Proton</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/protonvpn-apple-tv-app/">Proton VPN Launches Native Apple TV App, Adds Vision Pro Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/proton-vpn-launches-native-apple-tv-app-adds-vision-pro-support.2441444/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In 2023, Apple updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Max and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chips. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/">now refreshed</a> the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> with the M4 and M4 Pro chips, meaning that the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; faces a formidable competitor that offers "Pro" capabilities at a substantially lower price point. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-mini-Glowing-Yellow-and-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-973634" /><br/>
There are now two desktop Macs and four Apple silicon chip options for users who do not need the expandability of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>. The &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,999, overshadowing the &#36;599 starting price of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a> and even the &#36;1,399 starting price of the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, so do you need the performance of the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, or is the humble &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; sufficient for your needs? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two desktop Macs is best for you.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; share some fundamental features, including a familiar, boxy silver aluminum design, two front-facing USB-C ports along with HDMI and ethernet on the rear, and Apple silicon chipsets. That being said, the two machines have much more in contrast than they do in common, including different chip options, memory capacities, ports, and external display support capabilities.<br/>

Following the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;'s redesign this year, the dimensions of the two devices are now radically different, with the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; dwarfing the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; in every way.<br/>

To some extent, purchasing decisions should be driven by budget, but it is worth bearing in mind that any savings on the desktop computer itself can be put toward a good external display such as Apple's Studio Display, which starts from &#36;1,599. For example, an M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; paired with a Studio Display comes to &#36;2,898, which is just &#36;899 more than a lone base model &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and &#36;1,101 less than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; with no display.<br/>
<br/>
You should only consider the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; if you have a professional workflow that can leverage the extreme power of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra, as well as its additional ports and memory options. If you need the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, you will likely know that you are looking for a highly powerful machine that is capable of supporting specific intense workflows. Most customers should choose the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; over the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, saving &#36;700 when looking at the base models. There will likely still be substantial savings when it comes to custom configurations.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is also a better choice for most users at the current time since its chip technology is two generations ahead of the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, offering higher clock speeds, much faster single-core performance, a redesigned GPU architecture, AV1 decode, a markedly more powerful Neural Engine, and more. As a result, those looking to buy an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; may be better served by the M4 Pro &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;. Those who can take advantage of the performance of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; may still be better off with that high-end machine.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macs/">M4 Macs</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-mini-vs-mac-studio/">Mac Mini vs. Mac Studio Buyer&#039;s Guide: 25+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-mini-vs-mac-studio-buyers-guide-25-differences-compared.2337590/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung is considering introducing a new premium smartphone brand that would exist alongside or even replace its iconic "Galaxy" branding, according to Korean publication <em><a href="https://www.etoday.co.kr/news/view/2413937">E-Today</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/samsung-galaxy-s23.jpg" alt="" width="1972" height="1108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-880374" /><br/>
The potential rebranding initiative reportedly aims to differentiate Samsung's high-end devices from its budget offerings. Currently, the company's broad use of "Galaxy" spans from entry-level Galaxy A and M series phones priced around &#36;100-200 to premium Galaxy S flagships and Galaxy Z foldables that can cost upwards of &#36;1,800.<br/>
<br/>
Industry analysts suggest the wide price range under a single brand may dilute the premium perception of Samsung's high-end devices. The belief is that when consumers associate the Galaxy name with budget-friendly options, it becomes more challenging for Samsung to position its flagship devices as direct competitors to Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in the premium segment.<br/>
<br/>
In comments made at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a> in January, Samsung's global marketing head, Lee Young-hee, hinted at the potential branding strategy: "Galaxy has so many lineups that I understand people are expecting a new name when there is an innovative turning point," said Lee.<br/>
<br/>
What Samsung considers an innovative turning point is unclear, but such an initiative would involve significant marketing costs. The news comes as the company faces increasing competition from Apple in the premium segment, especially among younger consumers. For example, a recent Gallup Korea survey revealed that 64% of South Korean consumers in their 20s use iPhones, with that figure rising to 75% among women in the same age group.<br/>
<br/>
Industry observers have compared the potential strategy to Hyundai's successful Genesis luxury brand launch. Introduced in 2015, Genesis reached one million global sales by August 2023 and helped elevate Hyundai's brand image and profitability. Samsung has not revealed any specific alternative brand names, but it is reportedly conducting internal studies to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of introducing a new premium brand.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/samsung-considers-dropping-iconic-galaxy-brand/">Samsung Considers Dropping Iconic &#039;Galaxy&#039; Brand for Flagship Phones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-considers-dropping-iconic-galaxy-brand-for-flagship-phones.2441424/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple to Start Providing Summaries of User Reviews in App Store</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has reportedly designed a new AI-based system that will summarize reviews in the App Store to highlight the most common customer feedback for users before they download an app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/app-store-awards-2022.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876046" /><br/>
According an unlisted App Store article seen by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/29/app-store-summary-app-reviews/">9to5Mac</a></em>, AI-generated summaries will appear on app product pages alongside existing elements like descriptions and screenshots. The summaries will be dynamically updated as new reviews are posted to ensure feedback remains current, similar to the feature Amazon recently adopted to summarize reams of customer reviews on its product listings. <br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, apps will need to reach a certain threshold of reviews before becoming eligible for the feature, which will initially launch in select regions. Meanwhile, in an effort to maintain accuracy, developers will have the ability to report summaries they believe misrepresent their apps. <br/>
<br/>
The feature appears to be part of Apple's broader push into AI-powered features, following the recent introduction of text and notification summarization capabilities in iOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. Apple hasn't announced when review summaries will go live, but their presence in the App Store API suggests a launch may be imminent.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-summaries-user-reviews-app-store/">Apple to Start Providing Summaries of User Reviews in App Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-start-providing-summaries-of-user-reviews-in-app-store.2441417/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Memory Saver feature in the Chrome browser for desktop <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-performance-controls-october-2024/">now features</a> three different modes, including Standard, Balanced, and Advanced. Memory Saver is aimed at speeding up browser performance by limiting the memory that inactive tabs are using.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" /><br/>
Standard mode deactivates tabs based on your computer's needs, while Balanced mode considers both browsing habits and the needs of the system. Advanced mode deactivates tabs more quickly after you stop using them. You can select a Memory Saver mode by going to the Settings menu in Chrome and choosing the Performance option.<br/>
<br/>
Google has also added a Performance Detection tool to Chrome. The tool is able to identify potential performance issues that you might have, offering up solutions on how to fix the problem.<br/>
<br/>
To speed up a tab you're using, for example, Google says Chrome will suggest deactivating tabs using extra resources. Chrome users will see a "Performance issue alert" notification, and clicking on the included "Fix now" option will improve browsing. Performance Detection can be disabled in Settings.<br/>
<br/>
Chrome has additional performance controls that can be used to set websites that should always remain active, such as those that need to complete tasks in the background, plus there's an option to turn off visual indicators for inactive tabs.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-chrome/">Google Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/google-chrome-performance-controls/">Google Chrome Browser for Desktop Gains New Performance Controls</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-chrome-browser-for-desktop-gains-new-performance-controls.2441361/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In today's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> announcement video, Apple showed off some new capabilities that are coming to the Final Cut Pro video editing software in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/final-cut-pro-captions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973886" /><br/>
Final Cut Pro will soon incorporate AI for generating captions for videos without having to use additional software. Current versions of Final Cut Pro allow you to import captions from another app, use a plug-in, or write them yourself, but soon the software will generate them natively.<br/>
<br/>
The mention of the Final Cut Pro capability is at about 3:50 in the announcement video below.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Mac mini Announcement - October 29" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtFm9n3NVzE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Apple didn't highlight any other features coming to Final Cut Pro, but there was a short clip of the caption option that also suggests that a new "Magnetic Mask" function is coming, as well as a mention of AI effects. <br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://fcpcreativesummits.com">2024 FCP Creative Summit</a> is set to take place in November, and it's likely that we'll hear about new AI features coming to Final Cut Pro at the event.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/final-cut-pro/">Final Cut Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/final-cut-pro-ai-transcription-captions/">Final Cut Pro to Gain &#039;Transcribe to Caption&#039; AI Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/final-cut-pro-to-gain-transcribe-to-caption-ai-feature.2441349/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a new firmware update for all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> models. The &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; firmware has a build number of 7B19, up from the previous 7A304 firmware that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/18/apple-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7a302/">came out in September</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/airpods-4-blue.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972562" /><br/>
There is no word yet on what's included in the new &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; firmware, but it is available for both the standard &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; and the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; with ANC. This is the second firmware update that the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; have received since they launched earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recently updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 to add Hearing Health capabilities like a hearing test, hearing protection, and hearing aid functionality. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 also run the 7B19 firmware, but hearing aid functionality will not be included in the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple doesn't have a way to manually upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air when the AirPods are in a charging case and connected to an iOS device or Mac.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/airpods-4-firmware-7b19/">Apple Releases New AirPods 4 Firmware</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-4-firmware.2441328/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/">introduced a redesigned Mac mini</a> with M4 and M4 Pro chip options, and the computer provides two clues about RAM amounts for the next 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, which are expected to be announced tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
First, just like the new iMac, the base-model Mac mini with the M4 chip starts with 16GB of RAM, which is double the 8GB of RAM included in the equivalent previous-generation model. As has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/">already been rumored</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/">leaked</a>, it now looks almost certain that the next base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip will start with 16GB of RAM too. Given that a vocal contingent of Mac fans have long criticized Apple for including only 8GB of RAM with some Macs, the increased 16GB minimum would be a long-awaited change.<br/>
<br/>
Second, all higher-end Mac mini configurations with the M4 Pro chip start with 24GB of RAM, and this upgrade will likely extend to the incoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M4 Pro chip. The current MacBook Pro models with the M3 Pro chip start with 18GB of RAM, so this would amount to a 6GB increase for the new models. The increased unified memory can benefit multitasking and Apple Intelligence performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to announce the M4 Max, so it is unclear how much RAM that chip will support.<br/>
<br/>
All of this information will likely be confirmed in less than 24 hours.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/new-mac-mini-hints-at-macbook-pro-ram/">New Mac Mini Provides Two Clues About RAM in Upcoming MacBook Pros</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-mac-mini-provides-two-clues-about-ram-in-upcoming-macbook-pros.2441327/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>M4 Mac Mini is Apple&#039;s First Carbon Neutral Mac</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a>, Apple says it has reached a milestone in its overarching environmental goal of total carbon neutrality by 2030. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> is Apple's first carbon neutral Mac to date, and it joins the carbon neutral Series 10 Apple Watch models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/m4-mac-mini-carbon-neutral.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973768" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is made from more than 50 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in its enclosure, 100 percent recycled gold plating in its circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets.<br/>
<br/>
Apple claims that the electricity that was used to manufacture the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is sourced from 100 percent renewable electricity, and the company says that its worldwide clean energy projects address 100 percent of the electricity that customers use to power their &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple updated its shipping methods, and 50 percent of &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; computers by weight are shipped using non-air modes of transportation, like ocean freight, from the factory to their next destination. According to Apple, these changes have cut the carbon footprint of the Mac by more than 80 percent, and to make up the remaining emissions, Apple "applies high-quality carbon credits from nature based products" such as those <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/apples-restore-fund-cultivates-new-roots-in-the-atlantic-forest/">from the Restore Fund</a>. The Restore Fund uses funds from Apple and other companies to invest in carbon removal projects such as reforesting.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; packaging is fiber based, which Apple says brings it closer to its goal of eliminating plastic from packaging by 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ht" dir="ltr">Mac mini M4 box  <a href="https://t.co/gO1YvkYJLJ">pic.twitter.com/gO1YvkYJLJ</a></p>&mdash; Beta Profiles (@BetaProfiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1851310432881164678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Back in 2020, Apple announced that it was committing to being <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/21/apple-commits-carbon-neutral-supply-chain-2030/">100 percent carbon neutral</a> across its entire supply chain by 2030, with net zero climate impact for every Apple product sold. Apple plans to reduce emissions by 75 percent compared with 2015, while using carbon removal solutions for the remaining 25 percent of its carbon footprint.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's global corporate operations are already carbon neutral, and Apple has been making changes as it works toward hitting its 2030 goal.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-environment/">Apple Environment</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-m4-mac-mini-carbon-neutral/">M4 Mac Mini is Apple&#039;s First Carbon Neutral Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-mac-mini-is-apples-first-carbon-neutral-mac.2441326/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the M4 Pro chip, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> is able to support up to three 6K displays at 60Hz over Thunderbolt or HDMI, an improvement over the previous <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Pro model. The &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro version of the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; also supported three displays, but it could run only two at 6K 60Hz resolution and one at 4K 60Hz resolution. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/m4-mac-mini-displays.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973743" /><br/>
Apple's M4 Pro chip alternatively supports one display at 6K resolution over 60Hz and a second display at 8K resolution at 60Hz or 4K resolution at 240Hz. <br/>
<br/>
The standard M4 chip that Apple has used in the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> so far is compatible with three displays total, though not three 6K displays. It can drive two displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one display with up to 5K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt or 4K resolution at 60Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
It is also able to power an 8K display at 60Hz or a 4K display at 240Hz alongside a 5K display with a 60Hz refresh rate. <br/>
<br/>
With the M4 Pro chip, the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; can power three of the Pro Display XDR or three of the Studio Display. With the M4 chip, the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; can drive two Pro Display XDRs or three Studio Displays.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 Pro version of the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is equipped with three Thunderbolt 5 ports, and it is the first Mac that offers Thunderbolt 5 compatibility. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a> has three Thunderbolt 4 ports instead, and both models have two USB-C ports at the front. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/m4-pro-mac-mini-display-support/">M4 Pro Mac Mini Supports Up to Three 6K Displays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-pro-mac-mini-supports-up-to-three-6k-displays.2441322/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
