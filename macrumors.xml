		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a collection of iPad deals, including all-time low prices on the brand new M4 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M4 11-Inch iPad Pro</h2><br/>
Starting with the M4 iPad Pro, Amazon is back with a solid &#36;49 markdown on one model of the 11-inch iPad Pro. You can get the 256GB Wi-Fi 11-inch iPad Pro for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J6L2ZC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;949.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;999.00.<br/>
<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J6L2ZC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>256GB Wi-Fi M4 iPad Pro for &#36;949.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
This is a match of the record low price for this brand new iPad Pro, and as such it's been fairly popular and has resulted in some shipping delays. As of writing, you can still lock in this deal today and get the iPad Pro delivered by late May.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>10th Gen iPad</h2><br/>
Moving to the 10th generation iPad from 2022, Amazon has a few of these tablets at record low prices this week. Prices start at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMV%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;329.00</strong></a> for the 64GB Wi-Fi iPad, which is down from the new regular price of &#36;349.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/10th-gen-ipad-new.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951776" /><br/>
Apple cut the prices of this lineup earlier in the month, and each model is now &#36;100 cheaper. You can also get the 256GB Wi-Fi iPad on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLDDCGS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;474.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;499.00, another all-time low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMV%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;20 OFF</div>64GB Wi-Fi iPad for &#36;329.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Likewise, both cellular models are available for new record low prices on Amazon. The 64GB cellular iPad is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLDWX34%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;474.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;499.00, and the 256GB cellular iPad is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJM15LXC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;609.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;649.00.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Given Apple's rumored plan to add an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slimmer-iphone-17-major-redesign-rumor/">all-new high-end tier</a> to its iPhone 17 series in 2025, this could be the year for Apple to bring its boldest "Pro Max" model to the table â€” the kind of iPhone 16 upgrade that stands tall above its siblings, both figuratively and literally.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-Generic-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951761" /><br/>
If you have been holding out for the iPhone 16 Pro Max, here are five of the biggest changes rumored to be coming to Apple's largest smartphone. The iPhone 16 series is expected to be released in the fall around mid-September. For all the details, see our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">dedicated roundup</a>.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">1. Bigger Size</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">6.9 Inches</span><br><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/">multiple sources</a>, the iPhone 16 Pro Max will increase in size, potentially making it Apple's biggest iPhone ever. The device will measure in at 6.9 inches (up from 6.7), and is expected to be taller and wider than last year's iPhone 15 Pro Max. While thickness will remain the same, the weight will increase slightly due to the larger size. If accurate, it would be the first iPhone size increase since the iPhone 12 series, but it would also be another blow to those users who prefer a smaller handset.  <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">2. Bigger Screen</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Thinner Borders</span><br><br/>
It's logical to assume that a bigger device will have a bigger display, but Apple isn't just relying on larger physical dimensions to make the viewing experience more immersive. For its iPhone 16 Pro models, Apple is said to be using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/">Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology</a>, which allows for a more compact and efficient layout of the circuitry under the display, resulting in even slimmer bezels. Last year, Apple reduced the bezels on iPhone 15 Pro models using low-injection pressure over-molding, or LIPO, to shrink the display border size to 1.5 millimeters (versus around 2.2 millimeters on iPhone 14 models).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">3. Bigger Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Two 48MP Lenses</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/iphone-16-pro-max-to-feature-advanced-main-sensor/">more advanced main camera</a> that is 12% bigger, featuring a customized 48-megapixel Sony IMX903 sensor with a stacked design for better performance, a 14-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for high-quality image data conversion, and Digital Gain Control (DCG) for better dynamic range and noise control. It is also said to include a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, up from the 12-megapixel lens on the iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">4. Bigger Battery Capacity</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Longer Life</span><br><br/>
Apple will use battery cells with increased energy density, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/iphone-16-pro-max-longer-battery-life/">analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, which should offer longer battery life, perhaps even using the same battery size as that found in existing models. Early rumors have also suggested that both iPhone 16 Pro models will use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/iphone-15-could-feature-stacked-battery-technology/">stacked battery technology</a>, which can result in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/alleged-iphone-16-battery-details-leaked/">higher capacity</a> and a longer lifespan. According to <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223409700148&navType=by">another rumor</a>, this year's â€ŒiPhone 16 Proâ€Œ Max will boast an even bigger 30-hour-plus battery life (compared to 29 hours for the iPhone 15 Pro Max).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">5. Bigger Storage Capacity</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">More Terabytes</span><br><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">one rumor out of Korea</a>, Apple's forthcoming iPhone 16 Pro models will be available with a new 2TB maximum storage, which would put them on par with the iPad Pro. The move is said to be a result of Apple's recently rumored switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash for higher storage models. Apple's use of QLC NAND could allow Apple to fit more storage into a smaller space and it is less expensive than Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND, which current iPhones use.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/iphone-16-pro-max-biggest-rumored-features/">5 Biggest Changes Rumored for iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/5-biggest-changes-rumored-for-iphone-16-pro-max.2427016/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adobe today updated its Lightroom software for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac with Generative Remove, an AI-powered feature that can remove any element from a photo with a single click. Generative Remove eliminates unwanted objects in images non-destructively, intelligently matching the removed area with AI-generated content that matches the surrounding photo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/lightroom-generative-remove.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951707" /><br/>
Generative Remove is able to fix everything from an unwanted reflection in water to wrinkles in a tablecloth in food photography. It works with complicated backgrounds, and can be used for removing distractions from images or retouching photos.<br/>
<br/>
According to Adobe, users can expect to see "high-quality, realistic and stunning results." The Generate Remove feature is powered by Adobe Firefly, generative AI features that have previously been available in Photoshop. Generative Remove is available today as an early access feature for Lightroom for mobile, desktop, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, Web, and Classic.<br/>
<br/>
Along with Generative Remove, Adobe is also adding automatic presets for Lens Blur, a feature that is able to add blur effects to any part of a photograph, plus Lens Blur includes improved subject detection. Other improvements include HDR optimization, a streamlined mobile toolbar on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and instant access to photo libraries in the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Mac apps for faster editing.<br/>
<br/>
The new features are free for existing Lightroom users, with Lightroom access available <a href="https://prf.hn/l/o3p4zkW">starting at &#36;9.99 per month</a>.<br/>

		<title>Hands-On With the New Sonos &#039;Ace&#039; Headphones</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home">Sonos</a> today announced the launch of the Sonos Ace, the company's long-rumored over-ear headphones that are designed to compete with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. We were able to spend some time with the Sonos Ace last week, getting a firsthand look at the design and sound quality.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j00c5MF37Yc" title="Sonos Ace Over-Ear Headphones Hands-On &amp; First Listen!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Compared to the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, the Sonos Ace headphones are lighter weight and don't exert as much pressure on the side of the head. Sonos designed the ear cups from a soft memory foam that's wrapped in vegan leather, and the cups are designed to create a seal around the ears without catching on hair.<br/>
<br/>
The cup material isn't quite as premium looking as the aluminum of the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, and the Sonos Ace has a more traditional headband compared to Apple's version. There's a subtle logo on the right side of the Ace, and a set of buttons. The main button can be used for changing volume and controlling music playback, while the button underneath swaps between Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Aware Mode. ANC drowns out ambient sound, while Aware Mode allows sounds from the surroundings to come through.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos did a solid job with the ANC, though real world testing is needed to see exactly how the Ace measures up to the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;. Sound quality was also impressive, with support for Dolby Atmos and lossless over Bluetooth or USB-C, as well as spatial audio. TrueCinema, which maps the space around the user for better surround sound, will be implemented later this year. There are two custom-designed 40mm drivers in the Ace, which Sonos says should bring "impeccable precision and clarity," along with eight beamforming microphones.<br/>
<br/>
There's some unique integration with other Sonos products. When using the Ace with a TV that has an Arc soundbar, pressing on the button on the Ace will swap the TV's audio to the headphones instead of the Arc. Sonos plans to bring this to the Sonos Beam and Sonos Ray in the future.<br/>
<br/>
The Ace headphones don't fold, and Sonos offers them with a travel case for protection. Sonos says that the headphones are able to provide 30 hours of listening time with ANC, which is 10 hours over the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;. A three minute charge provides three hours of battery life.<br/>
<br/>
The Sonos Ace headphones <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home">are priced at &#36;449</a> and are set to launch on June 5, and they come in black and soft white.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/hands-on-sonos-ace-headphones/">Hands-On With the New Sonos &#039;Ace&#039; Headphones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-the-new-sonos-ace-headphones.2427003/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is challenging a &#36;1.95 billion fine imposed by the European Commission for thwarting fair competition from music-streaming rivals, including Spotify (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-21/apple-fights-1-8-billion-eu-antitrust-fine-for-curbs-on-spotify">Bloomberg</a></em>). <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
The Commission fined Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">March</a>, saying that the company abused its dominant position in the market by forbidding music streaming apps to tell users about cheaper subscription prices outside the app.<br/>
<br/>
The EU crackdown also mandated that Apple "remove anti-steering provisions" for music apps in the European Economic Area (EEA). Apple subsequently updated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules to let music apps in the EEA inform users of other ways to purchase digital music content or services and to add website links for purchasing digital music subscriptions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly filed a suit at the EU's General Court in Luxembourg to challenge the March decision. The Commission told reporters it is ready to defend its decision in court.<br/>
<br/>
When the fine was issued, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/?1709553731">said</a> the decision was reached "despite the Commission's failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm." Apple also said that the ruling "ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast."<br/>
<br/>
Apple also said that three different related cases mounted against it by the Commission over the past eight years consistently found no evidence of consumer harm and no evidence of anti-competitive behavior.<br/>
<br/>
The fine brought to a close a long-running investigation by the EU, triggered by a complaint from Spotify in 2015 into Apple's treatment of third-party music streaming services on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/apple-fights-2-billion-eu-fine-spotify/">Apple Challenges &#36;2 Billion EU Antitrust Fine Over Spotify Complaint</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-challenges-2-billion-eu-antitrust-fine-over-spotify-complaint.2427000/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max will boast a bigger main camera sensor while both iPhone 16 Pro models will feature a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera for the first time, claims a rumor coming out of Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Cameras.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913544" /><br/>
According to Weibo user <a href="https://weibo.com/6315816381/OfjH16KqK">OvO Baby Sauce OvO</a>, the main camera of the iPhone 16 Pro Max will be based on an advanced custom 48-megapixel Sony IMX903 sensor. In contrast, the iPhone 16 Pro will use the same 48-megapixel custom Sony IMX803 sensor as that found on the current iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
The leaker also claims that this year's iPhone 16 Pro models will feature an upgraded Ultra Wide camera with a 48-megapixel sensor, allowing it to capture more light and result in better photos when shooting in 0.5x mode, especially in low-light conditions. The Ultra Wide lens on the current iPhone 15 Pro models is 12-megapixels.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second time we have heard rumors that the iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature a more advanced main camera sensor. The claim was first made in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/iphone-16-pro-max-to-feature-advanced-main-sensor/">January</a> by "Digital Chat Station," a Weibo user responsible for leaking several accurate details about upcoming iPhone camera technology. <br/>
<br/>
The latter source said that the custom Sony IMX903 in the iPhone 16 Pro Max would include advanced features like a stacked design for better performance, a 14-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for high-quality image data conversion, and Digital Gain Control (DCG) for better dynamic range and noise control. <br/>
<br/>
We have also previously heard rumors of a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera coming to both iPhone 16 Pro models. The rumor first originated last <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/iphone-16-pro-rumored-to-feature-48mp-ultra-wide/">December</a> from Weibo user "Instant Digital," suggesting that this year's Pro devices will be the first to feature two 48-megapixel sensors. If true, the upgrade should mean that both â€ŒiPhone 16 Proâ€Œ models will be able to shoot 48-megapixel ProRAW photos in Ultra Wide mode.  <br/>
<br/>
Today's claim doubles down on the rumor and further corroborates a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">2023 forecast</a> from Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who said that the â€ŒiPhone 16 Proâ€Œ will feature a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera.<br/>
<br/>
In 2025, the iPhone 17 Pro is expected to complete the rear camera array's transition to 48-megapixel sensors, bringing the technology to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/">Telephoto lens</a>, which is currently 12-megapixels on the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft is going all in on AI, today introducing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-ai-windows-pcs/">series of Copilot+ PCs</a> that have AI-focused hardware. The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-pro-11th-edition">new Surface Pro</a> is one of the first Copilot+ PCs, equipped with Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite processor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/microsoft-surface-pro-qualcomm.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951687" /><br/>
Microsoft is already pitting the Surface Pro against Apple's M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and in marketing materials, claims that the Surface Pro has superior processing power and battery life. Compared to the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU, the Surface Pro and other Copilot+ PCs with 12-core and 10-core processors offer 58 percent better sustained multithreaded performance (based on Cinebench benchmarks).<br/>
<br/>
As for battery life, Copilot+ PCs support up to 15 hours of web browsing or 22 hours of local video playback. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models offer the same 15 hours of wireless web browsing, but only 18 hours of local video playback.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24160463/microsoft-windows-laptops-copilot-arm-chips-m1">The Verge</a></em>, Microsoft's demonstrations for media included several comparisons of the Surface Pro compared to the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, and the Surface Pro came out on top in many of them. Windows PCs have struggled to keep up with Apple silicon in recent years, but it appears that Qualcomm's technology is catching up.<br/>
<br/>
The Surface Pro is a 2-in-1 laptop that runs Windows, and it has an OLED display, much like Apple's newly launched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models. It weighs under two pounds, supports Wi-Fi 7, and has advanced AI capabilities enabled by the neural processing unit.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the Surface Pro starts at &#36;1,000, but the version with OLED display and Snapdragon X Elite chip, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD is priced starting at &#36;1,500. Microsoft today also introduced the Surface Laptop with the same Snapdragon X Elite chip, with pricing that starts at &#36;1,299.<br/>
<br/>
The Surface devices will arrive to customers starting on June 18.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-surface-pro-faster-macbook-air/">Microsoft Says New Surface Pro is Faster Than 15&quot; M3 MacBook Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-says-new-surface-pro-is-faster-than-15-m3-macbook-air.2426970/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/05/20/introducing-copilot-pcs/">today announced</a> the launch of new Windows PCs that have integrated AI hardware, called Copilot+ PCs. According to Microsoft, the Copilot+ PCs are the fastest PCs "ever built" with all-day battery life, chips capable of 40 trillion operations per second, and "access to the most advanced AI models."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Introducing Copilot+ PCs" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5JmkWJNng2I" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The new machines are designed with "AI at the center," introducing experiences that can be run directly on device to cut down on latency and improve privacy.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Recall</strong> - Recall gives the PC a "photographic memory" so users can access anything they've seen or done on their PC. Content can be located using timelines across any website, application, or document, with support for snapshots.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Cocreator</strong> - Text prompts can be used to generate new images using the neural processing units of the computer. Art can be created based on the text input, and there is a creativity slider to choose from a range between more literal to more expressive.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Restyle Image</strong> - Combines image generation and photo editing. Pre-set styles can be used to change the background, foreground, or full image.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Live Captions</strong> - Live Captions support live translations and can turn any audio that passes through the PC into a single, English-language caption experience in real time across all apps. Any live or pre-recorded audio in any app or video platform can be translated from 40 languages into English.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Quick Settings</strong> - In Windows Studio Effects, the Quick Settings option cleans up video with automatic image adjustments for videos calls to mitigate low-light or add filters.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
All Copilot+ PCs include a "powerful AI agent" that can be accessed with a single tap on the Copilot key. There is an AI interface that will support the latest models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft claims that the Copilot+ PCs outperform the 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> by up to 58 percent in sustained multithreaded performance, while also offering longer battery life. Microsoft says the battery is able to last for up to 15 hours of web browsing or 22 hours of local video playback, beating the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The new Microsoft Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are some of the first Copilot+ PCs, and ASUS, Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung have also introduced Copilot+ PCs. The new PCs are available today and are priced starting at &#36;999.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-ai-windows-pcs/">Microsoft Debuts New Copilot+ Windows PCs Designed Around AI</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-debuts-new-copilot-windows-pcs-designed-around-ai.2426961/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

iOS 17.5.1 and iPadOS 17.5.1 can be downloaded on eligible iPhones and iPads over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, the updates include a fix for an issue that could cause images to reappear in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> library even after being deleted. <blockquote>This update provides important bug fixes and addresses a rare issue where photos that experienced database corruption could reappear in the Photos library even if they were deleted.</blockquote>There have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-17-5-bug-deleted-photos-reappear/">several complaints</a> from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users who saw their old, deleted photos resurfacing after installing the iOS 17.5 update. Images deleted as far back as 2010 were surfacing again, leading to confusion and worry over what was going on. Apple's information today indicates that it was a database corruption issue, and iOS 17.5.1 should solve the problem.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams has visited Taiwan to secure supply of TSMC's upcoming 2nm chips, <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/7974714?from=edn_maintab_index"><em>Economic Daily News</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-silicon-feature-joeblue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-945652" /><br/>
The visit apparently involved a meeting between Williams and TSMC President Wei Zhejia to discuss custom AI chips and ensure that Apple will be able to access the chipmaker's 2nm manufacturing process, which is set to begin production in 2025. <br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> is powered by the A17 Pro chip, which is manufactured with TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process. This process allows for more transistors to be packed into a smaller space, delivering improvements in performance and efficiency. Apple's M4 chip, which just debuted in the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, uses an enhanced version of this &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; technology. The transition to 2nm chips should bring further improvements, with projected performance gains of 10 to 15 percent and power consumption reductions of up to 30 percent compared to the &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; process.<br/>
<br/>
Securing an early supply of 2nm chips is critical for Apple, as TSMC remains the only company capable of manufacturing them at the scale and quality required. This exclusivity is vital for Apple to meet the high demand for its products while limiting competitors' access to these more advanced chips. For its &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; chips, Apple booked all of TSMC's available chipmaking capacity. The company's 2nm chips could first appear in 2025's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 lineup.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-williams/">Jeff Williams</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/udn-com/">Economic Daily News</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-coo-jeff-williams-secures-2nm-chips/">Apple COO Jeff Williams Reportedly Visits Taiwan to Secure 2nm Chips</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-coo-jeff-williams-reportedly-visits-taiwan-to-secure-2nm-chips.2426931/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has launched another round of steep discounts on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models in mainland China, in a bid to boost sales in its biggest smartphone market and counter a strong showing by Huawei.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-15-china.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943595" /><br/>
The discounts run from May 20 to May 28 and are steeper than the price cuts that Apple introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/iphone-sales-china-dependent-promotions/">February</a>. <br/>
<br/>
For example, on its official store on Alibaba Group's Tmall site, Apple is offering discounts of up to 2,300 yuan (&#36;318) on select models. A top-of-the-line 256GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max can now be bought for 7,949 yuan (&#36;1,199), compared to its 9,999 yuan price tag when the device was released in September.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, an entry-level 128GB &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model is currently being offered at the discounted price of 4,599 yuan (&#36;636), down from its previous price of 5,999 yuan. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has become dependent on discounts to shift â€Œmid-cycle &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;â€Œ stock, with strong competition from Huawei's latest high-end series of <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/introduce-the-pura-70-series/">Pura 70 phones</a> said to be partly behind the most recent drop in sales. Apple's previous discounts in February were thought to be a response to growing interest in Huawei's homegrown Mate 60 series, which launched last August.<br/>
<br/>
Apple sales in China dropped 13 percent to &#36;20.8 billion in the quarter ended December, falling short of the &#36;23.5 billion predicted by analysts.<br/>
<br/>
However, despite a gloomy outlook for 2024, Apple's previous promotions in February are believed to have helped counteract its sales slowdown in China. <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-slashes-iphone-prices-china-amid-fierce-huawei-competition-2024-05-20/">Reuters</a></em> reports that Apple's shipments in the country increased by 12% in March, a significant improvement from the first two months of 2024, when the company experienced a 37% slump in sales.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/huawei/">Huawei</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-slashes-iphone-15-prices-again-china/">Apple Responds to Huawei Threat by Slashing iPhone 15 Prices in China</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-responds-to-huawei-threat-by-slashing-iphone-15-prices-in-china.2426918/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone SE 4 With Face ID Said to Be Priced Below &#36;500</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is targeting a sub-&#36;500 starting price for its upcoming fourth-generation iPhone SE model despite a raft of rumored upgrades coming to the more affordable device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
According to leaker <a href="https://x.com/Revegnus1/status/1792101343890731324">Revegnus on X</a>, the U.S. launch price of the fourth-generation iPhone SE will either remain at the same &#36;429 starting price as the current model, or will see an increase of around 10%. Either way, Apple's intention is to keep the price below &#36;500. <br/>
<br/>
Last week, <em>The Information</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/when-to-expect-the-next-iphone-se/">reported</a> that Apple plans to release a redesigned iPhone SE in the spring of 2025 that will remain the "cheaper" option in Apple's iPhone lineup. The design is said to be similar to the standard iPhone 14, which means Touch ID and the Home button will be replaced by Face ID and a display notch. <br/>
<br/>
Along the same lines, the iPhone SE 4 could have an OLED display rather than LCD, and the display size will increase from 4.7 inches to 6.1 inches. Other rumored features for the next iPhone SE include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/">USB-C port and an Action button</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The panel prices for the iPhone SE 4 are said to be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/iphone-se-4-oled-supplier-likely-boe/">lot lower</a> than suppliers charge for the OLED displays used in the iPhone 15, since the panels for the SE will use legacy parts identical to those used in the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, so the suppliers won't need to make new investments in R&D. Display manufacturers are believed to have been bidding to supply the panels since at least last August.<br/>
<br/>
The third-generation iPhone SE was released in March 2022, so there is likely to be pent-up demand for a new model that includes some of the latest features of Apple's flagship iPhone models.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today launched a limited-time promotion that increases the trade-in values for select iPhone models in the United States when customers buy a new iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-trade-in-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951609" /><br/>
The promotion lasts from today until June 3, and means anyone trading in their existing iPhone 11 or newer will get more money knocked off the price of a new iPhone. As you can see from some of the new trade-in values below, the adjustments are slight, but the promotion still means more credit toward an upgrade than customers would have gotten yesterday:<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>iPhone 14 Pro Max: Up to &#36;650 (vs. &#36;630)</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 14 Pro: Up to &#36;530 (vs. &#36;520)</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 14 Plus: Up to &#36;430 (vs. &#36;420)</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 14: Up to &#36;380 (vs. &#36;370)</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 13 Pro Max: Up to &#36;460 (vs. &#36;450)</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 13 Pro: Up to &#36;380 (vs. &#36;370)</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 13: Up to &#36;320 (vs. &#36;300)</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 13 mini: Up to &#36;300 (vs. &#36;270)</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone SE (3rd generation): Up to &#36;170 (vs. &#36;160)</li><br/>
</ul>Over the weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/18/apple-increase-trade-in-value-iphone-15-customers/">shared news</a> of the promotion ahead of time. However, Gurman said the better trade-in values would only apply to customers purchasing one of Apple's latest iPhone 15 models, and that's not the case. <br/>
<br/>
On the contrary, the boosted values listed above apply to any series model in Apple's current smartphone lineup, including the iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone SE.<br/>
<br/>
Trade-ins can be completed on Apple's website or at an Apple Store, and the credit can be applied towards the purchase of a new Apple product, or placed on an Apple gift card for later use. Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in">trade-in page</a> offers a complete list of values for devices.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-trade-in/">Apple Trade-In</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-boosts-iphone-trade-in-values-promotion/">Apple Promotion Boosts iPhone Trade-In Values for a Limited Time</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-promotion-boosts-iphone-trade-in-values-for-a-limited-time.2426913/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is poised to unveil an auto-summarization feature for notifications as part of a series of new artificial intelligence features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-19/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-summaries-cloud-and-on-device-llms-openai-deal-lwdj5pkz?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

In today's edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-19/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-summaries-cloud-and-on-device-llms-openai-deal-lwdj5pkz?srnd=undefined">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman provided more detail about what to expect from Apple's first major move into generative AI at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference:<blockquote>As part of the changes, the company will improve Siri's voice capabilities, giving it a more conversational feel, and add features that help users with their day-to-day lives â€” an approach it calls "proactive intelligence."<br/>
<br/>
That includes services like auto-summarizing notifications from your iPhone, giving a quick synopsis of news articles and transcribing voice memos, as well as improving existing features that auto-populate your calendar and suggest apps. There will also be some enhancements to photos in the form of AI-based editing, but none of those features will impress people who have used AI in Adobe Inc.'s apps for the last several months.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Gurman added that while Apple will mainly rely on on-device processing to support its AI features, it will also deliver them via the cloud in data centers that contain high-end Apple silicon chips designed for the Mac. He also noted that a ChatGPT-like chatbot will be noticeably absent from Apple's upcoming AI features. Apple executives are said to have admitted that they're "playing catch-up" internally. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's inaugural push into AI is widely expected to be revealed as part of previews of its next-generation software updates at WWDC, which begins on June 10.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/ios-18-to-use-ai-to-summarize-notifications/">iOS 18 to Use AI to Summarize Notifications, Add to Calendar, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-to-use-ai-to-summarize-notifications-add-to-calendar-and-more.2426866/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> today outlined his expectations for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup's color options, revealing that two new colors should replace two of the existing shades.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Perspective.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-935161" /><br/>
Kuo outlined his expectations in a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1792223282361680169">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today. He believes that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will be available in black, white or silver, gray or "Natural Titanium," and rose. This effectively means that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>'s Blue Titanium option will be discontinued and replaced with a new rose color. This mirrors <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1772522408144191732?s=20">an earlier rumor</a> originating in China, which claimed that the existing Blue Titanium color will be dropped from the â€Œ&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;â€Œ lineup in favor of a new "rose" titanium color.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus will apparently be offered in black, green, pink, blue, and white. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus are available in black, green, pink, blue, and yellow. This means that white will replace yellow, with the colors remaining the same. <br/>
<br/>
Kuo noted that Apple may rename some of the existing colors, such as when it changed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12's "White" to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>'s "Starlight." Likewise, where color names are not changed, the actual tone and appearance may still look different. The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is expected to be announced in the fall. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/iphone-16-lineup-to-come-in-these-two-new-colors/">iPhone 16 Lineup Rumored to Come in These Two New Colors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-lineup-rumored-to-come-in-these-two-new-colors.2426864/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> item tracker is on track to launch in mid-2025, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-19/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-summaries-cloud-and-on-device-llms-openai-deal-lwdj5pkz?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/AirTag-Feature-Recolor.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1013" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-850897" /><br/>
In his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-19/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-summaries-cloud-and-on-device-llms-openai-deal-lwdj5pkz?srnd=undefined">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman discussed Apple's work on the next-generation version of the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;, codenamed "B589." Apple is currently completing manufacturing tests with partners in Asia and the new item tracker is still timetabled to launch around the middle of next year. The new model will apparently feature an upgraded chip and enhanced location tracking capabilities. <br/>
<br/>
In October 2023, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said mass production of the second-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; had been postponed from the fourth quarter of 2024 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/airtag-2-postponed-until-2025/">until some point in 2025</a>. He believes the new &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; will have some kind of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/">integration with Apple's Vision Pro headset</a>, but he has not shared any more specific details.

In the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-19/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-summaries-cloud-and-on-device-llms-openai-deal-lwdj5pkz?srnd=undefined">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman said that Apple's current schedule does not include the launch of new &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; models until the middle of next year. Apple last updated the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; with M2-series chips at WWDC in 2023, meaning that they could go around 24 months without an update, even though the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> now contains the M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
All other Macs with the exception of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> should be available with M4-series chips by the end of 2024, but Gurman does not anticipate any new models being unveiled at WWDC in June, making 2022 and 2023 exceptions for recent mid-year Mac releases.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro">Mac Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1">Mac Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/no-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro-until-mid-2025/">Gurman: No New Mac Studio and Mac Pro Until Mid-2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro-until-mid-2025.2426840/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The popular repair website <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/">iFixit</a> today shared a video with teardowns of the new 13-inch iPad Pro and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-pencil-pro-announced/">Apple Pencil Pro</a>. The website praised the inclusion of adhesive pull tabs for the battery cells in the new iPad Pro, as they make repairs easier.<br/>
<br/>

We already shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/m4-ipad-pro-teardown/">another iPad Pro teardown video</a>, so the look inside the Apple Pencil Pro is the novel aspect here. Key hardware changes introduced with the Apple Pencil Pro include a gyroscope that allows you to rotate the accessory for precise control of shaped pen and brush tools, and a haptic engine that vibrates for certain actions. You can also track the location of the Apple Pencil Pro in the Find My app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Pencil Pro is priced at &#36;129 in the U.S. and launched on Wednesday.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/">Teardown</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/18/ifixit-apple-pencil-pro-teardown/">iFixit Shares 13-Inch iPad Pro and Apple Pencil Pro Teardown Video</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-shares-13-inch-ipad-pro-and-apple-pencil-pro-teardown-video.2426768/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
