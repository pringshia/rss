		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">updated the Mac Studio</a> with mismatched M4 Max and M3 Ultra chip options. Naturally, this has led people to wonder why Apple opted for an M3 Ultra instead of an M4 Ultra chip, and the answer is fairly interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M4-Max-and-M3-Ultra.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993312" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-announces-m3-ultra-and-says-not-every-generation-will-see-an-ultra-chip/">told <em>Ars Technica</em>'s Andrew Cunningham</a> that not every generation of M-series chips for Macs will include an "Ultra" chip.<br/>
<br/>
"When asked why the high-end Mac Studio was getting an M3 Ultra chip instead of an M4 Ultra, Apple told us that not every chip generation will get an 'Ultra' tier," he wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that means we will never get an M4 Ultra chip?<br/>
<br/>
Apple's explanation leads us to wonder which chip the next Mac Pro desktop tower will use. Both the Mac Studio and Mac Pro were updated with the M2 Ultra chip simultaneously in June 2023, and many people in the Apple community felt that the Mac Pro was thereby a bad buy since it costs thousands of dollars more than the Mac Studio despite there being a perceived lack of differentiation between the computers.<br/>
<br/>
When the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/mac-studio-coming-this-week/">rumor broke yesterday</a> that the Mac Studio would be updated with M3 Ultra chip, there was hope that Apple would eventually update the Mac Pro with an M4 Ultra chip, for increased differentiation between the computers. Apple's explanation doesn't bode well for that possibility, although it does not explicitly rule it out.<br/>
<br/>
The next Mac Pro could simply end up getting the M3 Ultra chip, and maintain that lack of differentiation over the Mac Studio.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">announced</a> refreshed Mac Studio models with M4 Max and M3 Ultra Apple silicon chips, and when configured with the highest specs, the faster M3 Ultra costs &#36;14,099, which is &#36;10,100 more than the starting price.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Mac-Studio-2025.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993134" /><br/>
Starting at &#36;3,999, the Mac Studio with M3 Ultra comes with an Apple M3 Ultra chip with 28-core CPU, 60-core GPU, and 32-core Neural Engine, 96GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. When configuring the machine with the following highest specifications possible, the pricing breakdown is as follows:<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>Apple M3 Ultra chip with 32-core CPU, 80-core GPU, and 32-core Neural Engine: +&#36;1,500</li><br/>
    <li>512GB of unified memory: +&#36;4,000</li><br/>
    <li>16TB of storage: +&#36;4,600</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Customers can also purchase Final Cut Pro (&#36;299.99) and/or Logic Pro (&#36;199.99) at Apple's checkout, which if chosen would result in a cost totaling &#36;14,598.98.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the M3 Ultra is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/">fastest Mac chip it has ever released</a>, thanks to its strategy of fusing two M3 Max chips together using the company's "UltraFusion" technology. This makes the chip's specs double that of the M3 Max. The new Mac Studio is available to <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-studio">pre-order</a> starting today, and it launches on Wednesday, March 12. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/maxed-out-m3-ultra-mac-studio-14099/">A Maxed Out M3 Ultra Mac Studio Will Cost You &#36;14,099</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/a-maxed-out-m3-ultra-mac-studio-will-cost-you-14-099.2452048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced the next of its M4 Mac models, but how much better really is the M4 chip over its predecessor?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/M3-vs-M4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-957214" /><br/>
The M4 chip debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> last year, promising around 20% faster performance than the M3 chip in both single and multi-core tasks. All of the key differences between the two chip generations are listed below:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>

 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Most of these upgrades, with the exception of core counts and memory bandwidth, apply to the entire selection M3 and M4 chips. Using Geekbench benchmarks, these are the approximate performance gains you can expect from the M4 chip:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>Benchmark Type</th><br/>
 <th>M3 Chip Performance</th><br/>
 <th>M4 Chip Performance (Improvement)</th><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>Single-core CPU</th><br/>
 <td>3,088</td><br/>
 <td>3,864 (+25.1%)</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>Multi-core CPU</th><br/>

 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>Metal GPU</th><br/>
 <td>47,466</td><br/>
 <td>57,603 (+21.4%)</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
While the M4 chip features notable enhancements over the M3, such as increased CPU and GPU performance and improved efficiency, the practical differences for users upgrading from an M3 system may not be as radical as the specifications suggest. The M3 chip already delivers impressive performance and efficiency, making it a formidable contender in its own right.<br/>
<br/>
The 25.1% improvement in single-core performance and 30.5% in multi-core performance highlight technical advancements, but for many users, especially those already equipped with M3-based devices, the everyday experience will likely not feel dramatically different. Tasks that benefit from single-core speeds, like launching apps and light productivity work, will be snappier, but for those accustomed to the M3's capabilities, this difference may not significantly impact their workflow.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the 21.4% increase in GPU performance means better graphics rendering and gaming capabilities, yet users who have enjoyed the M3's performance may find these enhancements less noticeable in routine tasks. The improvements in gaming and creative applications will benefit users who are heavily engaged in graphics-intensive work, but those using the M3 might not feel compelled to upgrade solely for these reasons.<br/>
<br/>
The 111% boost in the Neural Engine is a standout figure, demonstrating the chip's impressive artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning capabilities. However, for many users, especially with less demanding requirements, the difference might not justify the upgrade, especially as both the M3 and M4 chip support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>. That being said, the M4 chip's significantly improved Neural Engine makes it more likely to support and effectively run new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; and AI features as they emerge over the years. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of memory bandwidth, the 20% increase allows for faster data transfer, which is beneficial for data-heavy applications. Yet, again, for users already using the M3, this improvement may not translate into a dramatic change in performance.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, while the M4 chip certainly pushes the boundaries of what is possible with Apple silicon, it may not represent a radical shift for those already using the M3. Instead, the M4 is likely aimed at users looking to upgrade from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chips or older Intel systems, where the jump in performance is far more pronounced. It is telling that Apple primarily compares the M4 to the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; rather than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> or M3. <br/>
<br/>
For existing M3 users, the decision to upgrade may hinge more on specific needs and applications rather than a broad expectation of enhanced performance. For example, M3 Max chip users who push their system to the limit with highly intensive tasks may have good reason to upgrade. Likewise, if your current M3 or M3 Pro system seems to be insufficient for your workflow, you could consider upgrading to an M4 Pro or M4 Max device, but these upgrade paths will be unusual.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4/">M4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/m4-imac/">M4 iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-studio/">M4 Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macs/">M4 Macs</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3-vs-m4/">M3 vs. M4 Chip Buyer&#039;s Guide: How Much Better Really Is M4?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-vs-m4-chip-buyers-guide-how-much-better-really-is-m4.2441141/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-announces-new-macbook-air-with-m4-and-sky-blue-color-option/">introduction</a> of new 13-inch and 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models with M4 chips, Apple has discontinued the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and M3 variants on its online stores. Both models were available to buy new from Apple up until today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m3-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950298" /><br/>
Apple launched the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; in July 2022, and the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; became available in March 2024. Both laptops will likely remain available to buy from Apple through its online Refurbished store in the months to come.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not provide a like-for-like performance comparison for the new M4 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; versus the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; or M3 models. Instead, it compares the new version with &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models powered by Intel and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chips. However, when the M4 chip debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> last year, Apple promised around 20% faster performance than the M3 chip in both single and multi-core tasks.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 provides up to 23x faster performance than equivalent Intel-based &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models, and up to double the performance than the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; model, according to Apple. The new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models also support up to two external displays with the lid open, versus two with the lid closed on the M3 models.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with M4 chip starts at &#36;999, and is available to pre-order today, with availability beginning Wednesday, March 12.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-discontinues-m2-m3-macbook-air/">Apple Discontinues M2 and M3 MacBook Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinues-m2-and-m3-macbook-air.2452023/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-reveals-m3-ultra-taking-apple-silicon-to-a-new-extreme/">unveiled the M3 Ultra chip</a>, its fastest Mac chip ever released. It is available <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">in the new Mac Studio</a> that was also announced today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M3-Ultra-Chip.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1092" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993147" /><br/>
Apple says the M3 Ultra chip is essentially two M3 Max chips fused together with its "UltraFusion" technology, so the chip's specs are all doubled compared to the M3 Max. There was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/m3-max-chip-hidden-change/">speculation last year</a> about the M3 Max chip lacking UltraFusion technology, but Apple's announcement today has proven that rumor was false.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 Ultra chip features up to a 32-core CPU, with 24 performance cores and eight efficiency cores. Apple says the M3 Ultra chip is up to 1.5x faster than the M2 Ultra chip, and up to 1.8x faster than the M1 Ultra chip. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, the M3 Ultra chip can be configured with up to an 80-core GPU, and it has a 32-core Neural Engine. The chip supports up to 512GB of unified RAM, and it provides up to 819 GB/s memory bandwidth.<br/>
<br/>
Like the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, the M3 Ultra chip includes Thunderbolt 5 support for up to 120 GB/s data transfer speeds.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3-ultra/">M3 Ultra</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/">Apple Introduces M3 Ultra Chip With Impressive Performance, Up to 512GB of RAM, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip-with-impressive-performance-up-to-512gb-of-ram-and-more.2452020/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-unveils-new-mac-studio-the-most-powerful-mac-ever/">announced</a> that it has updated the Mac Studio with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chip options, Thunderbolt 5 ports, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Mac-Studio-2025.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993134" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-m4-max-chip/">M4 Max chip was already released</a> last year in the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro. It can be configured with up to a 16-core CPU, up to a 40-core GPU, and up to 128GB of unified RAM. Geekbench 6 benchmark results indicate that the M4 Max is up to 75% faster than the M2 Max chip available in the previous-generation Mac Studio.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/">all-new M3 Ultra chip</a> features up to a 32-core CPU, with 24 performance cores and eight efficiency cores. Apple says the M3 Ultra chip is up to 1.5x faster than the previous Mac Studio's M2 Ultra chip, which has up to a 24-core CPU.<br/>
<br/>
On the graphics side, the new Mac Studio can be configured with up to an 80-core GPU. Apple says graphics performance is up to 2x faster than the previous Mac Studio with the M2 Ultra chip, which has up to a 72-core GPU.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the Mac Studio can now be configured with up to 16TB of SSD storage, up from the previous model's 8TB maximum. And the M3 Ultra chip supports up to 512GB of unified RAM, whereas the M2 Ultra maxed out at 192GB of unified RAM.<br/>
<br/>
Following in the footsteps of MacBook Pro and Mac mini models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, the Mac Studio now supports Thunderbolt 5. There are four Thunderbolt 5 ports on Mac Studio configurations with the M4 Max chip, and six Thunderbolt 5 ports on configurations with the M3 Ultra chip. Thunderbolt 5 provides up to 120 Gb/s data transfer speeds.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first Mac Studio refresh since the desktop computer was updated with M2 Max and M2 Ultra chip options in June 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The overall design of the Mac Studio has not changed. The front of the computer has two Thunderbolt 5 ports, and an SD card slot, while the rear side has a mix of Thunderbolt 5 and/or USB-C ports depending on the configuration, an HDMI port, a 10-Gigabit Ethernet port, two USB-A ports, a headphone jack, a power cord connector, and a power button. <br/>
<br/>
The new Mac Studio can be used with up to eight 6K displays, such as Apple's Pro Display XDR. The previous model supports up to six 6K displays.<br/>
<br/>
The computer continues to support Apple Intelligence, which is available on any Mac with the M1 chip or newer.<br/>
<br/>
The new Mac Studio is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-studio">available to pre-order</a> starting today, and it will launch on Wednesday, March 12.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced refreshed 13- and 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models, now featuring the M4 chip, an upgraded camera, and a new "Sky Blue" color option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-hero.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-993128" /><br/>
"Sky Blue" is an all-new blue finish that joins Midnight, Starlight, and Silver. Apple describes it as a "beautiful, metallic light blue that creates a dynamic gradient when light reflects off of its surface." Space Gray is no longer available. All &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models come with a color-matched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charge cable. <br/>
<br/>
The M4 chip features a 10-core CPU, an up to 10-core GPU, and support for up to 32GB of unified memory. Apple says the new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is up to 2x faster than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> model. Neural Engine tasks are up to 3x faster. The M4 chip debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> last year, promising around 20% faster performance than the M3 chip in both single and multi-core tasks. <br/>
<br/>
With a new display engine, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; now offers support for up to two external 6K displays in addition to the built-in display.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; introduces a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera, which automatically keeps users centered in the frame as they move around during video calls. It also supports Desk View, which simultaneously displays the user and a top-down view of their desk.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; now features a lower starting price of &#36;999. Education pricing starts at &#36;899.

		<description><![CDATA[Qualcomm believes its latest X85 5G modem will set a "huge delta" between the performance of high-end Android devices and Apple devices, largely thanks to its AI-powered features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/qualcomm-x85-modem.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993121" /><br/>
Announced at this year's ongoing Mobile World Conference 2025 in Barcelona, Qualcomm's next-generation X85 modem supports 5G mmWave, 400MHz download bandwidth in the Sub-6GHz spectrum with 1024-QAM modulation for better data speeds, and Satellite connectivity. <br/>
<br/>
The X85 can deliver peak download speeds of up to 12.5Gbps and peak upload speeds of up to 3.7Gbps, according to Qualcomm. In addition, the modem can combine multiple frequencies from different carriers to deliver better performance.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of AI features, its AI-powered Data Traffic Engine is said to be able to reduce latency and improve speed and efficiency.<br/>
<blockquote>"It's the first modem that has so much AI, it actually increases the range of performance of the modem so the modem can deal with weaker signals," Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/qualcomm-ceo-says-its-new-modem-creates-a-huge-delta-with-apple.html">CNBC</a>.<br/>
<br/>
"What that will do will set a huge delta between the performance of premium Android devices, and iOS devices, when you compare what Qualcomm can do versus what Apple is doing."</blockquote>Apple claims its new C1 modem, which recently debuted in the entry-level iPhone 16e, is the most power-efficient iPhone modem ever, contributing to the iPhone 16e having the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/">longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone ever</a>. The company also says the C1 is up to 25% more power efficient than Qualcomm modems in other iPhones. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRjsMasGzKA">Third-party scientific testing</a> appears to back up Apple's claims.<br/>
<br/>
The C1 modem lacks support for ultra-fast mmWave 5G technology. This means users won't have access to the exceptionally fast speeds that mmWave technology can provide in specific locations such as stadiums, airports, and dense urban areas. However, Apple says the C1 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/apple-says-c1-modem-is-just-the-start/">just the "start"</a> and that it is going to keep improving the technology with each successive generation. Apple supply chain analyst <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1892605046078259711">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has said the iPhone 17 Air will also be equipped with the C1 modem.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Experience the next level of 5G connectivity with the Qualcomm X85 5G Modem-RF. Unrivaled connectivity and flexibility, even when your RF signal isn’t the strongest. <a href="https://t.co/Ke6c3u62Yu">pic.twitter.com/Ke6c3u62Yu</a></p>&mdash; Qualcomm (@Qualcomm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qualcomm/status/1896455889546076573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple's current agreement with Qualcomm extends through 2026, giving Apple ample time to perfect its modem technology while it has access to Qualcomm's modems for its premium iPhone models.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Tuesday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/apple-announces-new-ipad-air-with-m3-chip/">announced</a> new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air models with the M3 chip, and while the processor upgrade and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/apple-announces-redesigned-ipad-air-magic-keyboard/">updated Magic Keyboard</a> are the biggest changes, there's another apparent difference in the larger model compared to its predecessor that may have gone unnoticed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M3-iPad-Air.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992557" /><br/>
In the specifications guide for the new 13-inch iPad Air, Apple has omitted the "2x bass" feature mention from the device's landscape stereo speakers. <br/>
<br/>
Double bass was introduced in the previous-generation 13-inch iPad Air with M2 chip in May 2024. Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-the-redesigned-11-inch-and-all-new-13-inch-ipad-air-with-m2/">said</a> at the time that the 13-inch model delivers "even better sound quality" with double the bass, which is "great for enjoying music and videos." However, there is no mention of the feature in Apple's device specifications for the new M3 variant. The 13-inch iPad Air with M2 chip is the only iPad that has ever included a mention of "2x bass," and it's not clear if the capability has been removed, if both iPad Air model sizes now have equivalent bass, or if its omission is just an error. We've reached out to Apple for comment.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has never provided specific technical details about the enhanced bass effect in the 13-inch M2 iPad Air, so we don't know if it is tied to a hardware change or something else. If we don't hear back from Apple, perhaps a future device teardown will provide some clues.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/m3-ipad-air-no-double-bass-effect.jpg" alt="" width="1354" height="452" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993106" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple's iPad Air device specification comparison tool</em></div><br/>
With the M3 chip, the new iPad Air should offer up to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">20% faster performance</a> compared to the previous-generation model. The M3 chip also brings hardware-accelerated ray tracing to the iPad Air for the first time, providing improved graphics rendering in games. The new iPad Air is available to <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air">pre-order</a>, and it will launch on March 12. In the U.S., the 11-inch model continues to start at &#36;599, and the 13-inch model continues to start at &#36;799. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/13-inch-ipad-air-m3-chip-no-double-bass/">New 13-Inch iPad Air Specs Lack Audio Feature From Last-Gen Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-13-inch-ipad-air-specs-lack-audio-feature-from-last-gen-model.2451828/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The second beta of iOS 18.4 expands <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS messaging support</a> to more carriers in the United States and other countries, according to multiple reports on Reddit, the <em>MacRumors</em> forums, and other social media sites.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-rcs-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2776" height="1562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923042" /><br/>
After installing iOS 18.4, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mintmobile/comments/1j2qvcc/rcs_enabled_on_ios_184_beta_2/">with Mint Mobile</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleFi/comments/1j2wh7l/rcs_on_ios_finally_supported/">Google Fi</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ultramobile/comments/1j2txr4/ultra_has_rcs_on_iphones/">Ultra Mobile</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-beta-2-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2451210/?post=33773459#post-33773459">Tello</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/USMobile/comments/1j2sqfi/light_speed_rcs_access_is_in_the_works_184_beta_2/">US Mobile</a> are able to toggle on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a> messaging, and the functionality appears to be rolling out for all T-Mobile Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs).<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users with a T-Mobile MVNO can be enabled through the Messages section of the Settings app. It appears that &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; access is only available for those running the second iOS 18.4 developer beta, not the public beta.<br/>
<br/>
In France, Orange and Sosh also have &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; available with iOS 18.4 beta 2, according to <em><a href="https://iphonesoft.fr/2025/03/04/rcs-orange-sosh-ios-18-4">iPhoneSoft</a></em>, so &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; may also be rolling out worldwide for other carriers.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;RCS&zwnj; was enabled for major carriers with the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and it stands for Rich Communication Services. &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; is a communication protocol that improves messaging between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android users, offering support for higher resolution photos and videos, larger file sizes, audio messages, Wi-Fi messaging, real-time typing indicators, read receipts, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/ios-18-4-t-mobile-mvno-rcs/">iOS 18.4 Brings RCS Support to Google Fi, Mint Mobile and Other T-Mobile MVNOs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-brings-rcs-support-to-google-fi-mint-mobile-and-other-t-mobile-mvnos.2451361/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the latest beta of tvOS 18.4, there are new hints of Apple's work on a smart home hub accessory that's rumored to be coming as soon as this year. <em>MacRumors</em> found that Apple has added ChatKit framework to the tvOS code, which is curious as there is no Messages app available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-1-Textless.jpg" alt="" width="3000" height="1688" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987225" /><br/>
The ChatKit framework added to tvOS 18.4 includes reactions and notifications for tapback reactions added to iMessages, like "[person] disliked this" or [person] reacted with [emoji]," which would not be applicable to Apple's current devices that run tvOS.<br/>
<br/>
Both the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; and the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; are built on tvOS, and the upcoming smart home hub will be as well. While the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; and &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; would not work with the ChatKit code features added to tvOS 18.4, Apple's home accessory likely will.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">smart home "command center"</a> that Apple is developing is expected to have built-in Apple apps, and it's possible that one of those apps will include Messages.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that there is a shared codebase for tvOS and iOS, so this addition could mean nothing, but these ChatKit features were already included in iOS and have just been added to tvOS with the tvOS 18.4 beta.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's upcoming device will serve as a central hub for smart home management, but it will also support video calls, viewing photos, browsing the web, listening to music, getting news, and more. It is said to look something like an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with an all-display design, but it will be smaller, coming in at only six inches square.<br/>
<br/>
Users will likely be able to set it on a table or mount it on a wall, and the expectation is that there would be multiples throughout the house. It will include some sensors for features like sensing the temperature or detecting nearby people.<br/>
<br/>
There is no concrete word on when Apple's smart home hub will launch, but it could come in the second or third quarter of 2025.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/tvos-18-4-smart-home-hub-hints/">tvOS 18.4 Beta Further Hints at Apple&#039;s Work on Smart Home Hub</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-18-4-beta-further-hints-at-apples-work-on-smart-home-hub.2451359/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> arrives just ten months after the previous model. Last year, the biggest change was the introduction of an all-new 13-inch model. With the latest refresh, the most significant upgrade is the move to the M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/m2-ipad-air-fathers-day.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954134" /><br/>
The ‌2024 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models have now been discontinued by Apple, but they may still be found refurbished and with third-party resellers for lower prices. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to buy the 2024 ‌&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; or the new 2025 models. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> Airs from 2024 and 2025 share most of their key features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the older model to save money? <br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Every other aspect of the device is the same between the two models. The upgrade from the 2022 to 2024 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; was more significant, headlining with a larger size option for the first time, bringing it in line with devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, which are available in two sizes.

<br/>
Given the iterative nature of a single, generation-to-generation chip upgrade, with no enhancements to design, cameras, or display technology, it is almost certainly not worth upgrading from the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; to the M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Likewise, if the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; can be found at significantly lower price than the M3 model, this device is still a worthwhile buy. The M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is primarily aimed at those with an A14-based fourth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; or older.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2-vs-m3-ipad-air/">M2 iPad Air vs. M3 iPad Air Buyer&#039;s Guide</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m2-ipad-air-vs-m3-ipad-air-buyers-guide.2451356/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Aside from refurbished devices, the final iPhone and iPad models that Apple offered with 64GB of base storage were the third-generation iPhone SE and the iPad 10. Both of those devices are now discontinued, having been replaced by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/new-ipad-with-a16-and-more-storage/">new iPad with the A16 chip</a>, which are each available with a minimum of 128GB of storage.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Assassins's Creed Shadows is set to be released for the Mac on Thursday, March 20, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=q2zte70j">announced today</a>. The game will launch on Mac at the same time as it is released for PlayStation 5, Windows machines, and the Xbox.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/assassinscreedshadows.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992897" /><br/>
Ubisoft first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-mac-november/">announced plans</a> to bring the game to the Mac in May 2024, and at that time, it was supposed to be released in November. The game has been delayed multiple times since then, but it seems it will finally be ready to go later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Set in 16th century Japan, the action roleplaying game is part of the main Assassin's Creed gaming lineup, and it is the successor to Assassin's Creed Mirage. The game focuses on the dispute between the Assassin Brotherhood and the Templar Order, and players can take on the role of Fujibayashi Naoe, a shinobi assassin, or Yasuke, a samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Each character offers different controls and gameplay styles, with separate progression paths, skills, weapon options, and stats. While Naoe uses stealth skills, Yasuke excels at combat.<br/>
<br/>
The game has a vast open world to explore, and players will experience a variety of landscapes with evolving weather and seasons. There are castle towns, bustling ports, pastoral landscapes, and peaceful shrines.<br/>
<br/>
Ubisoft executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté said that Assassin's Creed Shadows is his team's "most ambitious" game to date.<br/>
<br/>
Playing Assassin's Creed Shadows on an Apple device requires a Mac with an Apple silicon chip, with real-time ray tracing available on M3 and M4 Macs. Ubisoft also plans to bring it to iPads with M-series chips.<br/>
<br/>
Assassin's Creed Shadows is priced at &#36;70 and it can be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-shadows/id6497794841?mt=12">pre-ordered from the Mac App Store</a> ahead of its March 20 release.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/">Mac App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/assassins-creed-shadows-mac-march-20/">Assassin&#039;s Creed Shadows Coming to Mac on March 20</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-mac-on-march-20.2451351/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the headline feature of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/new-ipad-with-a16-and-more-storage/">Apple's new lowest-cost iPad</a> is an A16 chip, the device has some other new features and changes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iPad-A16-Colors.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992621" /><br/>
Apple's official name for the new entry-level iPad is iPad (A16), but we are referring to the device as the iPad 11 in this article.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap eight smaller iPad 11 details you might have missed.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>In the iPad 11, the A16 chip has a 5-core CPU and a 4-core GPU, whereas the A16 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Plus has a 6-core CPU and a 5-core GPU.</li><br/>
<li>The iPad 11 does not support Apple Intelligence.</li><br/>
<li>The iPad 11 is the first entry-level iPad with a 512GB storage option.</li><br/>
<li>The iPad 11 supports Smart HDR 4, up from Smart HDR 3 on the previous model. Smart HDR 4 makes photos look "even more detailed and vivid."</li><br/>
<li>The iPad 11 supports Bluetooth 5.3, up from Bluetooth 5.2 for the previous model.</li><br/>
<li>While cellular iPad 10 models have a SIM card slot in all countries, the iPad 11 relies entirely on eSIM technology worldwide.</li><br/>
<li>The iPad 11 is still compatible with the first-generation Apple Pencil.</li><br/>
<li>Apple says the iPad 11 has an 11-inch display, while the iPad 10 is listed as having a 10.9-inch display. However, Apple is simply rounding up more with the iPad 11, as both devices actually have a 10.86-inch display.</li><br/>
</ul>Apple makes no mention of the iPad 11 having its custom C1 modem, so cellular models might still have a Qualcomm modem. We await teardowns.<br/>
<br/>
It is also unclear how much RAM is in the iPad 11, but we are working to confirm this detail as soon as possible. iPhones with the A16 Bionic chip have 6GB of RAM, but the iPad 11 has a regular A16 chip with reduced CPU and GPU specifications, so it is unclear if the iPad 11 has 6GB of RAM. The iPad 10 has 4GB of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
The new iPad can be pre-ordered now, and it will launch on Wednesday, March 12. In the U.S., the Wi-Fi model starts at &#36;349.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/a16-ipad-tidbits/">Here Are 8 Things to Know About Apple&#039;s New iPad With the A16 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-8-things-to-know-about-apples-new-ipad-with-the-a16-chip.2451346/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today filed a legal complaint with the UK's Investigatory Powers Tribunal in an attempt to quash the UK government's demand for backdoor access to encrypted data, reports <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d8fe709-f17a-44a6-97ae-f1bbe6d0dccd">Financial Times</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988727" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iCloud-Versus-UK-Key-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Earlier this year, the UK government <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-orders-access-icloud/">ordered Apple</a> to give it secret access to encrypted user data uploaded to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> worldwide, through the creation of a backdoor. The UK used its Investigatory Powers Act to justify the demand, but Apple has not complied.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-pulls-encrypted-icloud-security-feature-uk/">removed Advanced Data Protection</a> from the UK so that it would not have to provide the government with access to encrypted data. Advanced Data Protection is designed to provide end-to-end encryption to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac users for data stored in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will undoubtedly fight the UK every step of the way in order to protect user privacy, and the legal challenge that the company filed today could be heard as soon as this month. Apple is not able to discuss the order made by the UK in public due to the terms of the law, so the court case could be heard without public notice.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-deeply-concerned-uk-surveillance-law/">made it clear</a> that it would pull &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; features from the UK rather than compromise its user security, and while that only extends to Advanced Data Protection right now, it could lead to key features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> and iMessage being removed in the country. The UK wants backdoor access to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; data to fight terrorism and investigate child sex abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Apple fights vehemently against calls for backdoor access to user data, which we saw in 2016 when the U.S. government demanded that Apple unlock the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; of a shooter in San Bernardino, California. That led to a long legal battle that did not see Apple compromise its security. The U.S. has lately reversed course on encryption, and has been promoting end-to-end encryption for mobile devices to protect against foreign cyber campaigns.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. government is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/us-probes-uk-apple-backdoor-treaty-violation/">now looking into</a> whether the UK's demand has violated the CLOUD act, which keeps the UK from asking for data from U.S. citizens, and vice versa.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/advanced-data-protection/">Advanced Data Protection</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/apple-legal-complaint-uk-backdoor/">Apple Fights UK&#039;s Demand for iCloud Data Backdoor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-fights-uks-demand-for-icloud-data-backdoor.2451339/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> contains the M3 chip, upgraded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip in the previous generation, so how much better really is M3?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
With the introduction of the M3 series in 2023, encompassing the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, Apple once again set new benchmarks in performance, efficiency, and hardware-accelerated capabilities. The transition from ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ to M3 is marked by Apple's move to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process, among other key architectural improvements such as a completely redesigned GPU.<br/>
<br/>
When unveiling the M3 chips, Apple mainly focused on how they compare to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> series of chips, rather than their direct predecessors from the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ series. Even so, the M3 chip represents an advancement over its predecessor, with the headline upgrade being the transition to a more advanced fabrication process that is just ‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌ in size, down from 5nm on the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ series of chips. This is evident in the M3's increased transistor count, jumping from 20 billion in the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ to 25 billion, a 25% increase that contributes to its enhanced capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Benchmark tests underscore this progression, with the M3 outperforming the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ by about 17% in single-core tasks and approximately 21% in multi-core tasks. In GPU performance measured by Metal benchmarks, the M3 exhibits a notable improvement of around 15% over the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 chip introduces an all-new GPU architecture. This architecture includes Dynamic Caching, a breakthrough feature that optimizes GPU memory allocation and utilization, adapting in real-time to varying task demands. This enhancement not only boosts graphics performance for intensive applications but also bolsters the chip's overall energy efficiency. This is particularly beneficial for graphics-heavy tasks like advanced video editing, 3D rendering, and gaming. It also features support for AV1 video decode to provide more efficient and higher-quality video from streaming services.<br/>
<br/>
Both chips support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>. Despite similarities in the 16-core Neural Engine between the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ and M3, the M3's adoption of a ‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌ process leads to more efficient execution of machine learning and AI tasks. Additionally, the M3 maintains up to 24GB of unified memory (in Macs only), just like the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌, but leverages the new process for more efficient memory bandwidth utilization.<br/>
<br/>
One other notable difference between the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ and M3 chips is their energy efficiency. The ‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌ fabrication process enables the M3 to achieve higher performance without a proportional increase in power consumption, making the chip particularly appealing for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users who value a balance between power and battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the M3 chip is a notable upgrade from the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌, distinguished by its higher transistor count, improved performance in CPU and GPU tasks, and superior energy efficiency. While the M3 offers clear advancements, the extent of its superiority does not necessitate an immediate upgrade for ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ users, especially if their existing workflows are still completed comfortably. For new buyers or those upgrading from older models, the M3's improvements in performance and efficiency will be much more pronounced.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2-vs-m3-chip/">Apple M2 vs. M3 Chip: How Much Better Is M3?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-m2-vs-m3-chip-how-much-better-is-m3.2451337/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
