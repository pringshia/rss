We're also <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fpromotion%2Fpsp%2FAZ2RO0FES9I55%3Fref%3Dpsp_pc_cart_collapse%26redirectAsin%3DB09TT8GZK9%26redirectMerchantId%3DA294P4X9EWVXLJ">tracking a similar sale</a>, with a few different products, over at Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/anker-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912340" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Anker's sale is on its "MagGo" line of products, which include charging stations and portable power banks, all of which are compatible with any iPhone that has MagSafe. To get the deal, just add two or more of the full-priced products <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fcollections%2Fmagnetic-sale%3Fref%3DnaviMenu">on this page</a> to your cart and you'll automatically get 15 percent off each product.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fcollections%2Fmagnetic-sale%3Fref%3DnaviMenu"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">BUY 2, SAVE 15%</div>Anker MagGo Accessory Sale</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Note that there are already-discounted products on this page as well, but these do not count toward the buy two, get 15 percent off sale. They are still worth checking out, with a few solid deals on even more MagSafe-compatible accessories, like the popular <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fy1811%3Fvariant%3D42206465327254%26collections_magnetic-sale%3Dundefined%26Sort_by%3DRecommended">3-in-1 MagSafe Charging Cube</a>.<br/>

Because of this, we've broken down the sale into two lists below. Note that the prices in the first list represent the discounted price that you'll see after you add two or more products to your cart and head to the checkout screen. Also remember that Amazon has a few of these products in a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fpromotion%2Fpsp%2FAZ2RO0FES9I55%3Fref%3Dpsp_pc_cart_collapse%26redirectAsin%3DB09TT8GZK9%26redirectMerchantId%3DA294P4X9EWVXLJ">similar buy two, save 15 percent offer</a> going on right now.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.4 update to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its launch. The public beta comes a day after Apple released the developer beta. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4 introduces some of the features in the iOS 17.4 beta, such as new emoji characters. We don't know what Mac-specific features are included, but nothing new was found in the developer beta. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-seeds-first-public-beta-of-macos-14-4/">Apple Seeds First Public Beta of macOS 14.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-public-beta-of-macos-14-4.2417985/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.0.2 update for the Vision Pro headset, according to developer <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolas09F9/status/1752756819825508519">Nicolás Álvarez</a>. The software comes a week after the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-1/">visionOS 1.0.1 update</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
There is no word on what is included in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.2, and while the Vision Pro has yet to be released, review units are in the hands of members of the media, and they will be able to download and install this update.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.2 <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214070">addresses a WebKit vulnerability</a> that Apple says may have been actively exploited. The issue was also fixed in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.1 for developers, but the fix is in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.2 for those updating from &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that Vision Pro owners will have a day one update to install this software when they begin receiving their headsets on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro will ship with version one of the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; software, but we are expecting to see &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 2 with new features at WWDC in June.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2/">Apple Releases visionOS 1.0.2 Two Days Before Vision Pro Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2-two-days-before-vision-pro-launch.2417983/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Webex <a href="https://blog.webex.com/hybrid-work/seamless-collaboration-webex-on-apple-tv-4k/">today announced</a> the launch of its new Webex app that's designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K. The app is designed to allow hybrid workers to join meetings from the biggest screen they have, which is often a television.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/webex-apple-tv.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="636" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933816" /><br/>
Users are able to scan the QR code on the sign-in screen and log in to the Webex app on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; in order to join a meeting. Participating in a chat will require wirelessly connecting an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K to use the iOS device as a microphone and video camera.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has previously used the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; connection for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, but the functionality is available to third-party apps as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/webex-apple-tv-participants.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="688" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933817" /><br/>
Webex says that users can expect "crystal-clear audio and video," with the app offering a preview of video and microphone status ahead of when a meeting is joined. Calendar integration is available, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Remote can be used for browsing through meetings and accessing in-meeting controls such as the camera on the connected iOS device.<br/>
<br/>
Up to 25 simultaneous attendees can be shown on one screen with the Webex app for the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K, and the app can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> on the device. To use Webex on a TV, users must have a second-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K or later and an iOS device with either <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/webex-apple-tv-4k-app/">Webex Now Available on Apple TV 4K for Video Calls</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/webex-now-available-on-apple-tv-4k-for-video-calls.2417973/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the Mid 2012 model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624">obsolete products list</a> worldwide, according to its website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/13-Inch-MacBook-Pro-Mid-2012.jpg" alt="" width="1842" height="1036" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833351" /><br/>
Released in June 2012, this 13-inch MacBook Pro model was the last Mac with a built-in CD/DVD drive sold by Apple, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/27/apple-discontinues-non-retina-macbook-pro/">remained for sale until October 2016</a> as a lower-priced option. Apple continues to sell an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive">external SuperDrive</a> for customers who need a CD/DVD drive, but a USB-C adapter is required to use it with modern MacBooks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple considers a device to be "technologically obsolete" once more than seven years have passed since the company last distributed it for sale. Apple says MacBooks "may be eligible for an extended battery-only repair period for up to 10 years from when the product was last distributed for sale, subject to parts availability."<br/>
<br/>
On the software side, Apple dropped support for the Mid 2012 model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with macOS Big Sur in 2020.<br/>

		<title>Apple Vision Pro Battery Isn&#039;t Hot-Swappable, Switching Requires Restart</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Vision Pro headset comes with an external battery pack with a capacity of 3,166 mAh, compared to the 3,274 mAh battery found in the iPhone 15 Pro, although the voltages are different so the measurement alone can't be considered equivalent. Reviewers have also reported that there are significant size and weight differences between the two.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-battery-pack.jpg" alt="" width="1640" height="1060" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929544" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a>, the Vision Pro battery is about the width and height of an iPhone 15 Pro, but thicker. Weight-wise, it is also heavier: About 325g, compared to 187g for an iPhone 15 Pro. "It's closer in thickness and weight to two iPhone 15's than it is to one," according to Gruber.<br/>
<br/>
Marques Brownlee in his <a href="https://youtu.be/SaneSRqePVY?feature=shared&t=262">unboxing video</a> also described the battery as "pretty heavy," and compared it to phones with larger capacity 5,000+ mAh batteries that feel "much lighter." We'll probably have to wait for a teardown to find out what the additional weight can be attributed to.<br/>
<br/>
The external battery pack that comes with the Vision Pro is silver, has a proprietary connector for attaching to the headset, and a USB-C port for charging via the included 30W wall charger. The proprietary connector is connected to the Vision Pro by rotating it a quarter turn to lock it into place. <br/>
<br/>
For those considering buying an additional &#36;200 battery pack, one thing to bear in mind is that Vision Pro batteries are not hot-swappable: As Gruber notes, there is no built-in reserve battery in the headset, so when the power cable is disconnected, Vision Pro immediately powers off. A manual reboot is therefore required to switch batteries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the Vision Pro provides up to two hours of battery life overall, and up to 2.5 hours for 2D video playback specifically. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/apple-vision-pro/">several reviewers</a> claim to have gotten up to three hours out of a single charge in general use, with one reviewer saying they were able to watch a three-hour movie on a single charge. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Vision Pro Battery specs:<br><br>3166 MAh<br>35.9 Wh<br>Output 13V 6A max <br>Model number: A2781 <a href="https://t.co/XoSbxhHEHA">pic.twitter.com/XoSbxhHEHA</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1752464226092798125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
In terms of battery life, it doesn't make sense to compare the Vision Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro, given that the former undoubtedly draws a lot more juice to power an array of much more sophisticated cameras, sensors, displays, speakers, and microphones.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Vision Pro launches in the U.S. on Friday, February 2. Apple has said the Vision Pro will launch in additional countries later this year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has failed to properly comply with a court order that requires non-App Store purchasing options be made available to third-party developers, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> has told a judge (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/apple-accused-by-epic-of-failing-to-fix-app-store-as-court-asked">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
The Supreme Court earlier this month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/">declined</a> to hear separate requests from both Apple and ‌&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;‌ in their three-year-long lawsuit against each other regarding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules. As a result, Apple is able to continue to disallow third-party payment processing within apps, but it must allow developers to direct customers to a non-App Store purchasing option for digital goods.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/">made changes to its U.S. App Store policies</a>, and now allows apps to feature a single link to a developer website that leads to an in-app purchase alternative. However, Apple plans to continue to collect a 12 to 27 percent commission on content bought this way. The commission applies to transactions for digital goods and services that take place on a developers website within seven days after a user taps through an External Purchase Link to an external website.<br/>
<br/>
Epic likely wishes to contest this aspect of the change in particular, as well as Apple's implementation of them. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;‌ CEO Tim Sweeney on January 16 took to X (formerly Twitter) to criticize the‌ changes as soon as they were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/">announced</a>, and said that it would dispute Apple's "bad-faith compliance plan" in District Court. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A quick summary of glaring problems we&#39;ve found so far:<br><br>1) Apple has introduced an anticompetitive new 27% tax on web purchases. Apple has never done this before, and it kills price competition. Developers can&#39;t offer digital items more cheaply on the web after paying a… <a href="https://t.co/YkHuapG7xa">pic.twitter.com/YkHuapG7xa</a></p>&mdash; Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747408148799881390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Epic said in a filing Tuesday that it "disputes Apple's compliance" with previously ordered changes and said it will explain the "non-compliance" in a forthcoming filing.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Apple wants &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; to pay &#36;73.4 million in legal fees after Apple won the antitrust case brought against it by the North Carolinian games maker. Apple bases the claim on Epic's original violation of its developer agreement, when its <em>Fortnite</em> game offered an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/fornite-adds-direct-payment-option-on-ios/">in-app payment alternative</a> on the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌. Epic previously accepted that it would owe damages if it lost its antitrust claims against Apple. Now that it has, Apple has issued the bill.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-non-compliance-court-order-epic/">Apple Failed to Comply With App Store Court Order, Epic Tells Judge</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-failed-to-comply-with-app-store-court-order-epic-tells-judge.2417949/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17.4, currently in beta, Apple is adding audio transcripts to the Podcasts app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, meaning you'll be able to read along to your favorite podcasts as they are spoken.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/podcast-app-transcript.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932875" /><br/>
Apple is adding support for auto-generated transcripts in its Podcasts app, offering users another way to enjoy podcast content rather than simply listening to what is being said. <br/>
<br/>
If you're familiar with lyrics in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, it's very similar. When playing a podcast, simply tap the speech bubble icon at the bottom-left corner of the fullscreen media playback screen. <br/>
<br/>
Tap the auto-generated transcript that appears to make it fill the screen. The transcript automatically scrolls and highlights the text currently being spoken as the episode plays, or you can scroll through the transcript manually, and even tap on a sentence to jump to that point in the podcast. Text selections can also be highlighted for copying and pasting elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Friday-26-Jan-2024-15-54-44.jpg" alt="" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933285" /><br/>
In addition, a Search button at the bottom of the screen lets you search the transcript for specific words or phrases and jump to that point in the transcript, where you can then tap to skip to the audio track. <br/>
<br/>
Transcripts can also be accessed from the Up Next section in the Home tab. Simply press and hold a podcast episode to reveal the View Transcript option in the dropdown menu. And if you're on the episode details page, tap the ellipsis (three dots) button top-right to reveal the same option.<br/>
<br/>

As of writing, not all podcast episodes have transcripts right now, but Apple says that transcripts for back catalog episodes are being added over time. Transcripts are available in English, French, German, and Spanish, and podcast hosts also have the option to upload their own transcripts rather than using the automatically generated version.<br/>
<br/>
The transcripts feature is coming as part of Apple's iOS 17.4 update, which available to developers at the current time. Apple plans to release it to the public in March. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-search-transcripts-podcasts-app/">iOS 17.4: Using Apple&#039;s New Podcast Transcript Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-using-apples-new-podcast-transcript-feature.2417947/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first full-length reviews of the Apple Vision Pro were published today, revealing some new details about the headset before it launches in the U.S. on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v-m8xaf4jL4?si=Zlv3_rdqa7WB0333" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
To learn more, check out our roundup of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro reviews and unboxing videos</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Battery Life</h2><br/>
Apple says the Vision Pro provides up to two hours of battery life overall, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-vision-pro-battery-life-video-playback/">up to 2.5 hours for 2D video playback</a> specifically. In his review, however, Brian Tong said he achieved nearly 2.5 hours of battery life for general usage, and separately was able to watch the three-hour movie <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> on a single charge.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GkPw6ScHyb4?si=HuTcIFlBu1ty6f-b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber also said</a> he has consistently got at least three hours of battery life on a full charge, but he did not list any specific use cases.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it seems that the Vision Pro may last up to 30 minutes longer per charge than Apple's advertised battery life claims, but results will vary.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Home Screen</h2><br/>
According to Tong, third-party apps on visionOS are listed alphabetically starting on the second page of the Home Screen, and cannot be reordered like they can be on the iPhone and iPad. Apps cannot be placed into folders either. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Vision-Pro-Home-Screen-Brian-Tong.jpg" alt="" width="1952" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933712" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image Credit: Brian Tong</em></div><br/>
He also confirmed that websites cannot be added to the Home Screen via Safari, which is inconvenient given that some popular services like YouTube and Spotify will only be accessible via the web on the Vision Pro at launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could add these options in future visionOS updates.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Personas and EyeSight</h2><br/>
Since the Vision Pro covers your face during video calls, Apple allows you to create a digital version of yourself called a Persona.<br/>
<br/>
Apple refers to a Persona as an "authentic spatial representation" of a person that shows facial expressions and hand movements in real time. The feature is still in beta, and it seems that Apple has a lot of room for improvement.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Vision-Pro-Personas.jpg" alt="" width="3004" height="1473" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933710" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image Credit: Brian Tong</em></div><br/>
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-vision-pro-review-39f2d82e"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern</a>:<blockquote>On FaceTimes with friends and family, the reviews were unanimous: "You look awful," my sister said. "It's like Botox from hell," remarked the always-kind Jason Gay. "Frightening," said my dad.<br/>
<br/>
Calling other Vision Pro reviewers was slightly better because we all looked ridiculous. But everyone agreed I looked the worst. And this was after I remade my Persona numerous times, with professional lighting.</blockquote>Poor Joanna! (She's still amazing, nothing can change that!)<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8xI10SFgzQ8?si=VC5ALZ5njrpAlG18" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price"><em>The Verge</em>'s Nilay Patel</a>:<blockquote>I won't go into that much detail on Apple's deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here […] You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there's a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn't distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude.</blockquote>Personas extend to the Vision Pro's outer display, allowing others to view a digital recreation of your eyes. This feature is called EyeSight, and it has mostly been panned on social media since Vision Pro reviews were first published earlier today.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most surprising takeaway from all the Vision Pro reviews/videos is how universally awful the EyeSight display is. Until today, I expected it to be super important to the “I’m still in the real world” experience. Now, I’m 95% sure it’ll be canned by the 2nd gen. <a href="https://t.co/H90Wa3ckL7">pic.twitter.com/H90Wa3ckL7</a></p>&mdash; Snazzy Labs (@SnazzyLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyLabs/status/1752368311302795404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><h2>Mac Virtual Display</h2><br/>
Many reviewers shared their thoughts on using the Vision Pro as an external display for a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-mirrored-mac-screen.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1696" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930148" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-vision-pro-review-a-mind-blowing-look-at-an-unfinished-future/"><em>CNET</em>'s Scott Stein</a> was impressed:<blockquote>What if my desk was just floating monitors? What if I didn't need anything but a headset? Vision Pro gets close to that feeling when all the apps are open and the flow is going. I'm doing that now. I'm in my virtual floating computer as I write this. There are glitches, and sometimes the controls feel too floaty, but in its first form, I'm shocked at how good it already is.</blockquote>However, he mentioned a caveat:<blockquote>And while the Vision Pro's display is great as a monitor, staring into 3D space for a while puts my eyes into a different focus zone than actual reality. Taking the headset off to work on my laptop, my eyes need time to settle and refocus. I feel myself slipping into long sessions in Vision Pro, but my eyes want me to take breaks.</blockquote><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/apple-vision-pro-review"><em>Tom's Guide</em>'s Mark Spoonauer</a>:<blockquote>One of the options in Control Center is the ability to connect with your Mac, but you can also bring your Mac desktop into the Vision Pro just by looking at it. I saw a Connect button floating above my MacBook Pro 14-inch, pinched my fingers together and saw my laptop's screen go blank, popping up on the wall in front of me instead.<br/>
<br/>
You don't get multiple desktop views, but you do get a crystal clear 4K display that renders text crisply, and you can make that canvas positively huge so it dwarfs most of the best monitors. Your keyboard and mouse still work as they normally would with no latency. You can even use your keyboard in Vision Pro apps if you want. Yes, only Apple could do this, and I could see myself taking the Vision Pro on business trips and using it back at the hotel.</blockquote>Stay tuned for additional details about the Vision Pro over the coming days.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-vision-pro-review-highlights/">Vision Pro Reviews: Surprising Battery Life, &#039;Weird&#039; Personas, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-reviews-surprising-battery-life-weird-personas-and-more.2417925/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today stopped signing the iOS 17.2.1 update, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS going forward. iOS 17.2.1 is no longer being signed following the January 22 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-releases-ios-17-3/">release of iOS 17.3</a>, which introduced Stolen Device Protection for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-features/">and other changes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.2.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927308" /><br/>
It is not unusual that iOS 17.2.1 is no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; operating system.<br/>
<br/>
Along with iOS 17.2.1, Apple has stopped signing iPadOS 17.2 for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and the older 15.8 and 16.7.4 versions of iOS and iPadOS for devices unable to run <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1-changes/">already testing iOS 17.4</a>, a major update that is set to come out in March.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-2-1/">Apple Stops Signing iOS 17.2.1, Downgrading No Longer Possible</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-2-1-downgrading-no-longer-possible.2417902/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

There are multiple reports on Twitter and other social networks, and Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/">System Status page</a> says that some &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Mail users may not be able to send, receive, or access their messages. <br/>

Apple's System Status page also lists an issue with &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; web apps, and says that some users are unable to log in to iCloud.com.<br/>
<br/>
We'll update this article when the issue has been resolved and Apple's &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; services are working.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced a new firmware update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A324, up from the 6A300 firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2/">released in September</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/airpods-max-cyber-monday.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924096" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340">limited release notes</a> for the update list only "bug fixes and other improvements."<br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are powered on and connected to an iOS device or a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ Max‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌AirPods to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its release. The public iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 betas come a week after Apple released the betas for developers. Apple has also re-released the first beta of iOS 17.4 for developers with a new 21E5184k build number, which is the same build number used for the public beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932463" /><br/>
Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
The iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 betas introduce a whole slew of changes for users in the European Union, allowing for alternative app stores and alternative payment methods.<br/>
<br/>
There are new options for choosing a default browser, NFC has been opened up to banks and other financial institutions, and browsers aren't mandated to use WebKit.<br/>
<br/>
Along with these changes, the update also brings new emoji characters, Podcast transcripts, tweaks to Safari, hints of what we can expect from the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, and more.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> has over 12 million users in the United States, with card holders earning more than &#36;1 billion in Daily Cash rewards in 2023, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-card-is-helping-cardholders-live-healthier-financial-lives/">Apple said today</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/apple-card-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="1144" height="644" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-735877" /><br/>
Daily Cash is earned with every purchase on the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;. Apple provides 3% cash back for Apple purchases and items bought from select partners like T-Mobile, Ace Hardware, Panera Bread, Walgreens, and Uber. All <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> purchases with &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; earn 2% cash back, and all other purchases earn 1% cash back.<br/>
<br/>
Apple delivers Daily Cash rewards every day, and &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; holders can choose to have it added to the Apple Cash card or they can or opt in to having their cash deposited in the Apple Savings Account that launched last year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the "vast majority" of &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users have opted in to having their Daily Cash auto-deposited into Savings, and nearly two-thirds of users deposit additional funds from a linked bank account. The &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; offers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-savings-account-apy-increase/">an APY of 4.50 percent</a> at the current time, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/27/apple-card-savings-interest-rate-comparison/">on par with the high-yield savings accounts</a> from many competing financial institutions. <br/>
<br/>
Almost 30 percent of &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; customers make two or more payments per month, and more than a million &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users share their &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; with their Family Sharing Group. Close to 600,000 users have added spouses, partners, or another trusted adult to their &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;. For those with low credit scores who are not initially approved for an &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, Apple has a "Path to &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; Program." According to Apple, 200,000 users have been approved for an &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; after enrolling and following the program's personal steps.<br/>
<br/>
It has been almost five years since the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; launched in 2019, and &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; VP Jennifer Bailey said that new tools and features will be coming to &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; holders "in the year ahead and beyond."<blockquote>"We designed Apple Card with users' financial health in mind, and it's rewarding to see our more than 12 million customers using its features to make healthier financial decisions," said Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. "We're proud of what we've been able to deliver to Apple Card customers in just five years. As we look at the year ahead and beyond, we're excited to continue to innovate and invest in Apple Card's award-winning experience, and provide users with more tools and features that help them lead healthier financial lives."</blockquote>Though &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; is approaching its five-year launch anniversary, Apple has not managed to expand it to countries beyond the United States. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's relationship with &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; provider Goldman Sachs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-goldman-sachs-apple-card-issues/">has also soured</a>, and reports suggest that Apple and Goldman Sachs plan to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">end their partnership</a> in the next 12 to 15 months. Goldman Sachs is planning to cut back on its consumer business, and the partnership with Apple will be entirely dissolved. <br/>
<br/>
Apple will need to find another partner for the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, but has said that it is focused on providing the best experience for customers. Interruptions to the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; service are not expected, and there's as of yet no word on the financial institution that Apple might partner with to replace Goldman Sachs. The failure of the agreement between Goldman Sachs and the upcoming shift are likely to delay any behind-the-scenes plans that Apple has had to expand the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; beyond the United States. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhone 16 models launching later this year will not have any "significant design changes," according to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913688" /><br/>
Kuo also said that Apple is unlikely to offer "more comprehensive" generative AI features until the iPhone 17 series launches next year at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
"It is expected that Apple will not launch new iPhone models with significant design changes and the more comprehensive/differentiated GenAI ecosystem/applications until 2025 at the earliest," wrote Kuo, in a <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/2024-iphone-shipments-likely-to-decline-significantly-by-about-15-yoy-due-to-structural-challenges-1cedb3ea3b85">blog post on Medium</a> today.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo believes foldable designs and generative AI features are two of the biggest trends for high-end smartphones right now, and he thinks iPhone shipments could decline in 2024 as a result of Apple not launching products focused on these areas yet.<br/>
<br/>
One notable hardware change rumored for the iPhone 16 lineup is the addition of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">so-called "capture" button</a> for video-related actions. According to a recent report, the button will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">respond to pressure and touch</a>. For example, the report said users will be able to zoom in and out in the Camera app by swiping left and right on the button, focus with a light press, and start a video recording with a more forceful press.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models are also expected to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, compared to 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Is a new button and a larger display significant or not? Ultimately, it's subjective.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/kuo-iphone-16-no-significant-design-changes/">Kuo: iPhone 16 Models to Lack Significant Design Changes Beyond Larger Displays and Capture Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-16-models-to-lack-significant-design-changes-beyond-larger-displays-and-capture-button.2417868/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
Both of the MagSafe Chargers in this sale are in brand new condition and come with a one year Apple manufacturer limited warranty. You'll find an estimated delivery between February 7 and February 12, although those dates may change depending on your location.<br/>
<br/>
The highlight of the sale is the MagSafe Duo Charger for <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-magsafe-duo-fast-wireless-charger%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_1"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00. This beats the previous deal we tracked in January by about &#36;20 and is a match for the best-ever price on the accessory. The MagSafe Duo Charger can simultaneously charge an iPhone via MagSafe and an Apple Watch.<br/>

<h2>Reviews</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price"><em>The Verge</em>'s Nilay Patel</a>:<blockquote>There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they're all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can't ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn't.</blockquote><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-vision-pro-review-39f2d82e"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern</a>:<blockquote>Apple's headset has all the characteristics of a first-generation product: It's big and heavy, it's battery life sucks, there are few great apps and it can be buggy. And come on, have you seen what this thing thinks I look like?<br/>
<br/>
Yet so much of what the Vision Pro can do feels sci-fi. I'm flicking apps all over my home office. I've got multiple virtual timers hovering over my stove. I'm watching holograms of my kid petting a llama. It's the best mixed-reality headset I've ever tried, way more advanced than its only real competition, the far cheaper Meta Quest Pro and Quest 3.<br/>
<br/>
These companies know these aren't really the devices we want. They're all working toward building virtual experiences into something that looks more like a pair of regular eyeglasses. Until then, they're just messing with our heads.</blockquote><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-vision-pro-review-a-mind-blowing-look-at-an-unfinished-future/"><em>CNET</em>'s Scott Stein</a>:<blockquote>The very first thing I noticed about the Vision Pro in my first demo was how good the displays were. The 4K-resolution-per-eye, micro-OLED display tech Apple uses is basically the "retina" moment for VR and AR. It's vivid, richly colored, HDR and just stunning. Not only is it good enough for movies -- something Apple is touting constantly -- but it's better than any TV in my house.</blockquote><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/apple-vision-pro-review"><em>Tom's Guide</em>'s Mark Spoonaeur</a>:<blockquote>As for endurance, the Vision Pro's battery is rated for 2 hours of general use and 2.5 hours of video playback. In my testing of on and off use over 2 hours, the Vision Pro was down to about 60% and then down to 40% after another couple hours.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to use the Vision Pro continuously, you can always just plug in the battery using the included USB-C power adapter. Competing mixed reality headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro have batteries built into the headset, which is more convenient, but they're also less powerful.</blockquote><h2>What's in the Box</h2><br/>
Alongside the Vision Pro, the following accessories are included in the box:<ul><li>Light Seal</li><br/>
<li>Light Seal Cushion (Two Sizes)</li><br/>
<li>Solo Knit Band</li><br/>
<li>Dual Loop Band</li><br/>
<li>Front Cover</li><br/>
<li>Battery Pack</li><br/>
<li>Vision Pro Polishing Cloth</li><br/>
<li>30W USB-C Power Adapter</li><br/>
<li>USB‑C Charging Cable</li></ul>Apple also released an optional <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-releases-vision-pro-accessories/">Vision Pro travel case</a> for &#36;199. It features compartments for the external battery pack, ZEISS optical inserts, fabric front cover, and additional accessories. Apple says the case has a fabric exterior with a polycarbonate protective layer, a soft microfiber inner lining, and a retractable handle.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared the "Replay 2024" playlist with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> subscribers, allowing you to start tracking all of the songs you've been streaming so far this year. Just like the past few years, this playlist ranks a total of 100 songs based on how many times you've listened to them.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Music-Replay-24-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-933515" /><br/>
"Replay 2024" will update every week with the newest order of your most-listened-to tracks. By the time 2024 ends, the playlist provides an overall look at your music history for the year.<br/>
<br/>
Once you've listened to enough music to generate the playlist, you'll find it at the bottom of the Listen Now tab in ‌&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;‌ on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. There's also a more detailed version of the data tracking feature on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/replay">Apple Music for the web</a>, including most streamed artists and albums, and statistics for detailed play counts and hours listened.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been making its yearly Replay playlists available since 2019. Spotify Wrapped has been dominating this area of the music streaming business for a few years now, mainly thanks to its easily shareable infographics that come out in early December. In addition to Replay playlists, in 2022 Apple introduced a "Highlight Reel" feature with more statistics about each users' listening history at the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Head to the ‌‌&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;‌‌ app or <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/replay">Apple Music on the web</a> to add the Replay 2024 playlist to your library. If you haven't listened to enough music yet in 2024, the playlist may not appear in your ‌&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;‌ app. Once you do listen to more music, you should see your Replay 2024 playlist appear as usual in the Listen Now tab.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Post-apocalyptic open world action game <em>Death Stranding</em> is today officially available on iPhones, iPads, and Macs powered by Apple silicon. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Death-Stranding.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932460" /><br/>
Previously released on PlayStation 5 (2021) and PC (2022), the Director's Cut version for Mac was announced by legendary game creator Hideo Kojima at WWDC 2023 to showcase the potential gaming performance of Apple silicon. Apple subsequently teased an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> version at its "Wonderlust" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> event in September.<br/>
<br/>
Gamers take on the role of Sam Bridges (played by Norman Reedus of <em>The Walking Dead</em> fame) as a courier tasked with delivering supplies to isolated colonies and reconnecting them via wireless network following a cataclysmic event known as the Death Stranding. Unfortunately for everyone, the event opens a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to grotesque creatures from the afterlife roaming a ravaged and desolate world.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> sister site <em>TouchArcade</em> has an <a href="https://toucharcade.com/2024/01/30/death-stranding-directors-cut-iphone-15-pro-review-graphics-performance-settings-controller/">updating review</a> of the game, which supports &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max devices, as well as Macs running one of Apple's M-series chips.<br/>
<br/>

<em>Death Stranding Director's Cut</em> is currently listed in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/death-stranding-directors-cut/id6449748961">App Store</a> at the promotional price of &#36;19.99 (normal price &#36;39.99). Note that this is a universal purchase giving players the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, iPadOS, and macOS versions in a single purchase as well as support for cross-device progress syncing.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/death-stranding-directors-cut-iphone-mac/">Death Stranding Director&#039;s Cut Now Available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/death-stranding-directors-cut-now-available-on-iphone-ipad-and-mac.2417845/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
