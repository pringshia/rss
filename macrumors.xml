		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week began selling the seven-year-old Beats Solo3 wireless on-ear headphones in <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MT283LL/A/beats-solo3-wireless-headphones-gold">new Gold and Silver color options</a> for &#36;199.95 on its online store. The headphones also remain available in Black, Rose Gold, and (PRODUCT)RED.<br/>
<br/>

Released in 2016, the Beats Solo3 are now very old headphones with outdated technologies, such as micro-USB charging and Bluetooth 4.0, but they do have a W1 chip for quick and easy pairing with Apple devices. The headphones are more affordable than the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/beats-studio-pro-debut/">Beats Studio Pro</a>, which are regularly priced at &#36;349.95.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear how long Apple will continue to sell the Solo3, so keep in mind that the headphones could be discontinued sooner rather than later.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/beats-solo3-now-available-in-gold-and-silver/">Apple&#039;s Old Beats Solo3 Headphones Now Available in Gold and Silver</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-old-beats-solo3-headphones-now-available-in-gold-and-silver.2406288/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today refreshed its product lineup with new Pixel smartphones, a new Pixel watch, and updated Pixel earbuds, all of which will compete with Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/google-pixel-announcements.jpg" alt="" width="2060" height="1159" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915310" /><br/>
The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are Google's latest smartphones, and the Pixel 8 Pro is the high-end model that has all of Google's most recent technological advancements. It features a 6.7-inch 1 to 120Hz display, similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max, while the standard Pixel 8 has a 120Hz 6.2-inch display.<br/>
<br/>
Google has updated the design of its Pixel smartphones, adding a polished aluminum frame and matte glass for the Pro and a satin metal frame and polished back glass for the standard Pixel. Google says the devices have softer silhouettes compared to the prior-generation models, and they come in new colors. Google is using Gorilla Glass Victus for both, but the Pro has Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for better durability.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915318" /><br/>
The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are equipped with Google's Tensor G3 chip with enhanced AI capabilities that can filter out more spam calls, improve image processing, erase background noise from videos, and boost call quality. There's also a Titan <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> security chip, and with this combo, the Pixel phones have facial recognition secure enough to be used to sign in to apps and make payments.<br/>
<br/>
According to Google, the triple-lens rear camera system of the Pixel 8 Pro features better performance in low light and improvements to zoom and video capture Google added a new Video Boost technology for HDR+ and enhanced color grading, and the camera also supports Night Sight Video.<br/>
<br/>
With the updated Tensor chip, Google is promising that the Pixel 8 devices will get operating system and security updates for seven years, which will rival what Apple delivers with iOS.<br/>
<br/>
One of the main selling points of the Pixel 8 Pro is a new thermometer, which can tell you the temperature of an object with just a camera scan. Google is also touting updated Google Assistant functionality, with the Assistant able to translate, read aloud, and summarize web pages, as well as distill key points about what's on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
The Pixel 8 Pro is priced starting at &#36;999, which is the same starting price as Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, and the Pixel 8 is priced starting at &#36;699. Best Buy is currently offering pre-order bonuses for both devices, with <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMzlP4MXC">Pixel 8 Pro purchases including a free Pixel Watch 2</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMzmouv1Q">Pixel 8 pre-orders including free Pixel Buds Pro</a>, with more details on those devices below. Pre-order customers can also receive up to &#36;800 off with a qualified trade-in.<br/>
<br/>
Google's new smartphones were introduced alongside the Pixel Watch 2 (<a href="https://howl.me/ckIMATg3ne2">&#36;349.99 for Wi-Fi</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMASGbw3K">&#36;399.99 for cellular</a>), which incorporates more advanced heart rate tracking and stress detection from Fitbit. There are new body-response and skin temperature sensors that work alongside heart rate and heart rate variability to detect potential signs of stress or reactions from alcohol, caffeine, and other substances.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/pixel-watch-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915312" /><br/>
The Pixel Watch 2 directly adopts an Apple feature, Safety Check. Google says that with Safety Check, you can let friends and family know where you are, setting a timer for a check in. When that timer expires, Safety Check prompts you to confirm that you are okay, and if there is no response, real-time location information is shared with emergency contacts.<br/>
<br/>
As for battery life, the Pixel Watch 2 is now able to last for up to 24 hours, and it charges to full in 75 minutes. Design wise, it is lighter than the prior model, and it has a thinner domed cover over the circular face.<br/>
<br/>
Google is also updating the <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMFeCRY5e">&#36;199.99 Pixel Buds Pro</a> with new colors and new AI-powered features such as clearer calling for reduced noise, hearing wellness measurements that keep track of how loud your music is, conversation detection that pauses music when you start speaking, and improved latency through a new low-latency mode. Aside from the new colors, the updated feature set is available to all Pixel Buds Pro through a software update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/pixel-buds-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1113" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915316" /><br/>
More information about Google's new products <a href="https://store.google.com/?hl=en-US">can be found on Google's website</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook netted around &#36;41.5 million after taxes this week after selling 511,000 shares of Apple stock that he received as part of a performance-based award, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019323000089/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1696381457.xml">filing</a> released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Tim-Cook-MacBook-16x9.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894618" /><br/>
The stock award was determined based on Apple's total shareholder return relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 between the first day of Apple's 2021 fiscal year and the final day of Apple's 2023 fiscal year. Based on this metric, Apple ranked 141 of the 480 companies that were included in the S&P 500.<br/>
<br/>
Cook still owns nearly 3.3 million shares of Apple following the sale, the filing indicates.<br/>
<br/>
Cook was awarded an additional 73,010 restricted stock units, with one-third of the units to vest on April 1 each year in 2026, 2027, and 2028. He was also awarded 219,030 performance-based restricted stock units that are scheduled to vest on October 1, 2026, but this amount is subject to change based on Apple's S&P 500 performance.<br/>
<br/>
In a 2015 interview with <em><a href="https://fortune.com/2015/03/26/tim-cook/">Fortune</a></em>, Cook said that he planned to give away all his wealth, after paying for his nephew's college education. Cook said that he would take a "systematic approach to philanthropy."<br/>
<br/>
Cook has been CEO of Apple since 2011, and he has worked at the company for 25 years.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/tim-cook-nets-41-million-from-apple-stock-sale/">Tim Cook Nets &#36;41.5 Million After Selling Over 500,000 Apple Shares</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-nets-41-5-million-after-selling-over-500-000-apple-shares.2406274/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 have been out for a few weeks now, and Amazon is still offering launch discounts on both wearables. You can get &#36;9 off the Apple Watch Series 9 and up to &#36;25 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with no coupon code required.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-and-Ultra-2-Deals-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913210" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Although not particularly steep discounts, Amazon's prices are solid for anyone who's planning to pick up one of the new Apple Watches soon. Most models can be delivered as soon as October 6 for Prime members and around October 9 for free delivery options.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWYVS23%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;25 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;774.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Amazon only has one Apple Watch Ultra 2 model at the new all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWYVS23%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;774.00</strong></a> (Indigo Alpine Loop, Large). You'll find a large collection of other models at &#36;779.99, which is still a solid &#36;19 discount for these brand new watches. <br/>
<br/>
Another highlight is the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDJM3151%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;219.99</strong></a> with an on-page coupon discount, down from &#36;249.99. Only one color is available at this second-best price, the Midnight Aluminum with Midnight Sport Band. You can also get the 44mm GPS Apple Watch SE model at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDJ9M1HG%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;249.99</strong></a> with an on-page coupon discount, down from &#36;279.00. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> are now Apple's most inexpensive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> options, starting at &#36;429 and &#36;599, respectively. Apple released the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; in late 2021 and has bumped it down in price since then to make it more accessible as new models have been released. On the other hand, the third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-announces-new-iphone-se/">launched in early 2022</a>, refreshing the most affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; option in the lineup.<br/>
<br/>

With just &#36;170 between them, should you get the smaller entry-level &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that still has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> Home button or the all-screen model that has come down in price over time?

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Overall, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; remains an excellent entry-level &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; option for just &#36;429. It contains the A15 Bionic chip, which is still widely available across Apple's lineup of devices and offers more than sufficient performance. With &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj;, wireless charging, water resistance, a capable rear camera, and the latest version of iOS, it is a great smartphone for those new to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and have basic needs. Some users value the more traditional design, Home Button, and size of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;, but there is no escaping the fact that the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; offers an older and more basic &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; experience with a design dating back to 2014's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6.<br/>
<br/>
For &#36;170 more, the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; offers a decidedly more modern and advanced smartphone experience thanks to a much more modern design and a brighter, OLED display, as well as &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, an Ultra Wide camera, Cinematic mode, Night mode, considerably better front-facing and rear cameras, &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, and longer battery life. There is also the benefit of improved water resistance, the ultra wideband chip for Precision Finding with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>, and Dolby Atmos audio playback. There are even additional color options to choose from. All of this makes for a significant upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; if you can afford the &#36;170 extra, but it is worth bearing in mind that they are not essential capabilities for many users.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is an excellent device if your needs or budget are limited, but there is no doubt that the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;'s larger display, more modern and durable design, brighter OLED display, better cameras, longer battery life, and &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; compatibility are universally beneficial. In most cases, this is worth the &#36;170 extra if you can afford it.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that the next-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, which is not expected to launch until 2025, is expected to be based on the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;'s all-screen design. This means that buying an &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; is also likely to be a much more future-proof purchase, looking reasonably up to date compared to Apple's other devices in the coming years.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-vs-iphone-13/">iPhone SE vs. iPhone 13 Buyer&#039;s Guide: Comparing Apple&#039;s Cheapest iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-vs-iphone-13-buyers-guide-comparing-apples-cheapest-iphones.2406264/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models are set to receive a new Double Tap gesture later this month in an upcoming software update. Here's everything Double Tap can do, and how you can get it working on your watch today. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910334" /><br/>
Double Tap is a new gesture-based feature for the latest Apple Watch models that lets you control watch functions by tapping your thumb and index finger together twice. The feature aims to make it easier to navigate the Apple Watch when you have only one hand free, like when you're walking a dog, carrying groceries, or holding a cup of coffee.<br/>
<br/>
The new Double Tap gesture is <strong>exclusive to the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2</strong>, and will be enabled with the release of watchOS 10.1 in October. watchOS 10.1 is currently available today as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">developer beta</a>. If you want to install the beta on your watch, it will need to be paired to an iPhone running the iOS 17.1 beta, which you can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-ios-17-beta-iphone/">download for free</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What Double Tap Can Do</h2><br/>
Double Tap's functionality is pretty simple. You raise your watch to wake, and then you double tap your thumb and index finger together to control what's happening on the screen of your watch. <br/>
<br/>
By default, Double Tap selects the primary button in whatever app you're in. So for example, if you get a call, you can double tap to answer, and use it to hang up when you're done. Likewise, if you're watching/listening to media, you can pause it and resume it (or skip). <br/>
<br/>
Some other use cases: If you've set a timer, double-tapping will pause it. Performing the gesture again will resume the countdown, and when the timer goes off, a double-tap will stop it. Similarly, you can use it to do other everyday things like snooze alarms, trigger the Camera Remote app's shutter button, and dismiss notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-double-tap.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913385" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Double Tap activation is indicated by a blue icon at the top of the screen</em></div><br/>
As you might expect, the gesture is also set up to assume your other hand is preoccupied. If you receive a text, for instance, a double tap lets you reply with a voice message, while another double tap sends the message.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Double Tap can be used to invoke the Smart Stack from the watch face and advance through your widgets, offering you a one-handed glance of your most regularly viewed information. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Set Up Double Tap</h2><br/>
Double Tap is disabled by default, so you will need to enable it manually for it to work. This can be done from your wrist or in the Watch app on iPhone, and both menus include options to customize Media Playback and Smart Stack functionality. <br/>
<br/>
Note that to enable Double Tap, setup involves giving watchOS permission to disable some Accessibility options, including Assistive Touch, Zoom with Hand Gestures, VoiceOver with Hand Gestures, and Quick Actions.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>On Apple Watch:</h3><br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Double Tap</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Double Tap</strong> on the next screen.</li><br/>
<li>If prompted, tap <strong>Turn off Accessibility Features</strong> at the bottom of the on-screen alert.</li><br/>
<li>Choose your preferred setting for "Playback" (<strong>Play/Pause</strong> or <strong>Skip</strong>) and "Smart Stack" (<strong>Advance</strong> or <strong>Select</strong>).</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/enable-double-tap2.jpg" alt="settings" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915348" /><br/>
<br/>
<h3>On iPhone:</h3><br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Watch</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>With the "My Watch" tab selected, tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Double Tap</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Double Tap</strong> on the next screen.</li><br/>
<li>If prompted, tap <strong>Turn off Accessibility Features</strong> in the on-screen alert.</li><br/>
<li>Choose your preferred setting for "Playback" (<strong>Play/Pause</strong> or <strong>Skip</strong>) and "Smart Stack" (<strong>Advance</strong> or <strong>Select</strong>).</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/enable-double-tap1.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915349" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple says Double Tap is enabled by the S9 chip's faster Neural Engine, which is why the feature is only available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2. Apple said it developed an algorithm that detects the "unique signature" of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb are tapped together.<br/>

If you own an earlier Apple Watch model that doesn't support Double Tap, you can always try a similar but more limited accessibility feature called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-hand-gestures-control-apple-watch/">AssistiveTouch</a>, which is available on the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/double-tap/">Double Tap</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/new-apple-watch-double-tap-gesture/">New Apple Watch Double Tap Feature: What It Does and How to Get It</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-watch-double-tap-feature-what-it-does-and-how-to-get-it.2406256/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The new integration means users can use the cards to make contactless payments in-store, and use iPhones, iPads, and Macs to make purchases in apps and on the web using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
To get started, users should open the Apple Wallet app, tap the + button, then select the add "Debit or Credit Card" option. Cards can then be scanned or card details entered manually. PayPal says that users will be able to do this directly in the PayPal or Venmo apps in the coming months. <br/>
<br/>
When making payments with &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, users can earn 2% on purchases with the PayPal Cashback Credit Card, earn PayPal Rewards points when shopping with the PayPal Debit Card and redeem them for cash back or other rewards, and earn cashback with the Venmo Debit Card at participating businesses.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second beta of an upcoming iOS 17.1 update, and the software further refines some of the new features that were added both in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and the initial iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.1-Feature-Fall-Muted.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915266" /><br/>
This guide covers everything new in the second iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>StandBy Display Options</h2><br/>
Apple added a new "Display" section to the StandBy section of the Settings app, which houses some new customization options. The display can be set to turn off automatically, after 20 seconds, or never.<br/>
<br/>

The existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/">Night Mode</a> function that adds a red tint and dims the screen has been relocated to this section, as has the Motion to Wake toggle. The Display section also replaces the prior Always On toggle that limited the display to turning off intelligently.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Ringtones and Text Tones</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 beta 1 removed the more than 20 ringtones and text tones that were added in the launch version of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, but they have been reintroduced.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-1-ringtones.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915262" /><br/>
The new ringtones include Arpeggio, Breaking, Canopy, Chalet, Chirp, Daybreak, Departure, Dollop, Journey, Kettle, Mercury, Milky Way, Quad, Radial, Scavenger, Seedling, Shelter, Sprinkles, Steps, Storytime, Tease, Tilt, Unfold, and Valley. Reflection continues to be the default ringtone option.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the old ringtones, many of the new ringtones are longer in length and sound more modern. Apple has moved all of the prior ringtones to the "Classic" section so they are still accessible for those who prefer options like Illuminate, Night Owl, Constellation, and Twinkle.<br/>
<br/>
There are more than 10 new text tones that can be used for incoming text messages, voicemails, incoming mail alerts, reminder alerts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>80% Charging Limit Fix</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, Apple added a toggle that prevents the devices from charging past 80 percent in order to keep the battery healthy for a longer period of time. In the prior beta, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> would ignore this setting and charge past 80 percent, but that no longer happens following the second beta update.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Double Tap</h2><br/>
Double Tap is enabled in the second watchOS 10.1 beta that was provided to developers today, but the settings for it can be managed using the Apple Watch app.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix plans to increase the price of its ad-free subscription plans a few months after the end of the Hollywood actors strike, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/netflix-price-increase-actors-strike-792de9be">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884792" /><br/>
Prices will go up in the United States and Canada first, and it is not yet clear how much more Netflix will charge. Netflix <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/14/netflix-raises-prices/">last raised prices</a> at the beginning of 2022, charging &#36;9.99 per month for the Basic plan, &#36;15.49 per month for the Standard plan, and &#36;19.99 per month for the Premium plan.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix has since eliminated the Basic plan and added a Standard with ads plan that is priced at &#36;6.99 per month. The company has also ended all multi-household sharing, so Netflix users must reside in the same location to share a Netflix plan, otherwise there is an additional cost for another member slot.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple streaming services have been raising their prices this year. Ad-free Disney+ streaming will soon be &#36;13.99 per month, and ad-free Hulu is going to be &#36;17.99 per month following price hikes set to go live this month. There is no specific word yet on when Netflix will raise prices.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/netflix-price-increase/">Netflix to Raise Ad-Free Subscription Prices Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-to-raise-ad-free-subscription-prices-soon.2406185/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17.1 Code References Apple Pencil With USB-C</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> code that was added to the second beta of iOS 17.1 references USB-C charging for the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, a function that does not exist for either of the two current &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models that Apple sells.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/black-apple-pencil-feature-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2404" height="1356" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-744321" /><br/>
"Connect to USB-C to recharge soon," reads the text, which is accompanied by another line that says "&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Battery Very Low."<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if this is a reference to a new version of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; or text that is related to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQLU3AM/A/usb-c-to-apple-pencil-adapter">USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter</a> that allows the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; to be charged using a 10th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. With this adapter, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; plugs in to the Lightning end of the Adapter and the USB-C connector plugs into the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, facilitating a charge over USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">iOS 17.1 Beta 2 (21B5056e) changes:<br><br>- Double Tap support added to watchOS 10.1 Beta 2 for Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2<br>- New Standby settings<br><br>Apple Pencil 3?<br><br>Also, code in beta 2 suggests that Apple might be planning an Apple Pencil 3 with USB-C charging support.

Given that this adapter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/21/apple-pencil-adapter-shipping-delay/">came out last year</a>, it is not quite clear why Apple is just now adding the text, but it is a logical explanation and could be related to the possible launch of a next-generation low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The other option is that Apple is working on a new version of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with a USB-C connector.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could in theory refresh the original &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; to replace the Lightning connector with a USB-C connector without too much hassle, allowing the company to carry on offering the higher-end, slimmer magnetic &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and other iPads, and the lower-cost, rounder &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that charges via a connector and works with Apple's low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
A USB-C port might not make sense if Apple has plans for a third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; compatible with all iPads, as the new version would likely take after the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and charge magnetically via an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. A single &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that has no connector at all and is able to work with all iPads would simplify the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; lineup and cut down on any confusion.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is transitioning its products to USB-C because of new European Union regulations that require electronics to use a universal port. Apple could opt for a USB-C charging option for fast charging purposes, but a future &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; would also be able to skirt the USB-C requirement with wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not a new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; has USB-C, there seems to be a third-generation version in the works. Earlier this week, a rumor suggested that the next &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; would feature magnetic tips with different shapes for drawing, sketching, and painting.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/ios-17-1-apple-pencil-usb-c/">iOS 17.1 Code References Apple Pencil With USB-C</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-code-references-apple-pencil-with-usb-c.2406180/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The section can be found in the System Settings app under General → Coverage, and it provides an overview of hardware service options and other information.<br/>
<br/>
A similar "Coverage" section already existed in the Settings app on the iPhone and iPad under General → About → Coverage, and now it is on the Mac.<br/>

Emergency text messages will be set out to cell phones across the United States.<br/>
<br/>

The Wireless Emergency Alert test is scheduled to begin at 2:20 p.m. Eastern Time tomorrow, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners can expect to receive a text message in English or Spanish, depending on the language settings of the device. In addition to smartphones, test messages will also be sent to televisions and radios.<br/>
<br/>
Test messages going to smartphones will make it clear that the alert is a test, with the following text: "THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed." An "alert tone" will be played when the notification is initially received.<br/>
<br/>
Wireless Emergency Alerts are used in the United States to allow federal, state, and local agencies to send out short emergency messages from cell towers in a targeted area. They are designed to warn of an impending natural or human-made disaster, though the system is also used for child abductions and public safety alerts.<br/>
<br/>
AMBER Alerts, Emergency Alerts, Public Safety Alerts, and Test Alerts can all be enabled or disabled on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by going to the Notifications section of the Settings app and scrolling all the way down to Government Alerts. Turning off the toggles will prevent the alerts from being received.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/iphone-emergency-alert-test-october-4/">U.S. iPhone Users to Receive Emergency Test Alert Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-iphone-users-to-receive-emergency-test-alert-tomorrow.2406166/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, Apple replaced the traditional mute switch with a new multi-function Action Button. The button can be assigned to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-how-to-customize-action-button/">perform a number of tasks</a>, ranging from activating the flashlight to turning on the camera. Perhaps the most useful way to use the Action Button is with Shortcuts, because the single button can perform more than one action at once or bring up a selection of tools.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/le7zAdF36R8" title="iPhone 15 Pro Action Button: Best Custom Shortcuts!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
We've rounded up three of the best methods for using Shortcuts to get the most out of the Action Button.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-multibutton-assign-two-shortcuts-to-the-same-action-button-press-on-iphone-15-pro/">MultiButton Shortcut</a></strong> - Federico Vittici of <em>MacStories</em> created a way for two separate shortcuts to be assigned to the Action button. With MultiButton, if you press the Action Button once, it runs the primary shortcut, but if you press it twice in quick succession, it will run a secondary shortcut. Since Apple doesn't support multiple presses for the Action Button, this is a clever workaround. The MultiButton Shortcut is available from <em><a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-multibutton-assign-two-shortcuts-to-the-same-action-button-press-on-iphone-15-pro/">MacStories</a></em>, and Viticci also has some Shortcut suggestions to use with the MultiButton.</li><br/>
 	<li><b><a href="https://twitter.com/vittortech/status/1705580354218701154">Position-Based Actions</a></b> - YouTuber Dan Vittorini created a Shortcut that performs different actions depending on the orientation of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> when it's activated. If the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is in portrait orientation, it toggles silent mode. If the phone is held with the top to the left, it takes a photo, and if the phone is held with the top to the right, it takes a video. You can, of course, customize these to your liking.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Shortcuts Folder</strong> - Perhaps the simplest way to make use of the Action Button is to set it to show the Shortcuts Folder, a unique action only available to the Action Button. You can set it to show all of your Shortcuts or just your favorites, so when you press the Action Button, you get a menu with your most useful Shortcuts. To set this up, open up the Settings app, choose Action Button, swipe over to Shortcut, tap on Choose a Shortcut... then select Show Folder and choose your preferred folder.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Three days after Apple said that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">would release a software update</a> with a fix for a bug contributing to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max overheating</a>, <em>MacRumors</em> can confirm that Apple is now internally testing iOS 17.0.3.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.0.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915213" /><br/>
It's unclear when iOS 17.0.3 will be released to the public, but the update will likely be available either later this week or next week.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not provide any specific details about the bug that it identified, but it said that it will not be reducing the performance of the A17 Pro chip with its planned software update. Apple also said the iPhone 15 Pro's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/">titanium frame is not to blame</a>, so it appears that the overheating issues are not the result of hardware deficiencies.<br/>
<br/>
The same bug fix should eventually be included in iOS 17.1, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">currently in beta</a> and is expected to be released in late October.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added that the overheating issues were also related to some apps overloading the A17 Pro chip, including Instagram, Uber, and racing game Asphalt 9: Legends. Apple said it was working with the developers of these apps to address the situation. Instagram already released an app update with a fix on Wednesday.

Double Tap lets Apple Watch users double tap an index finger and thumb together to interact with the Apple Watch using one hand. The sensors in the Apple Watch are able to detect the fine movements, registering it as a tap on the display.<br/>
<br/>
The Double Tap gesture can be used to perform single-tap actions such as answering or ending a phone call, stopping a timer, playing and pausing music, snoozing or turning off an alarm, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Because Double Tap is enabled through the S9 chip in the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and Apple Watch Ultra, it is a feature that is limited to these models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/watchos-10-1-double-tap-support/">watchOS 10.1 Beta 2 Adds Support for Double Tap</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-beta-2-adds-support-for-double-tap.2406141/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that runs on the upcoming Vision Pro headset. The third beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-releases-third-visionos-beta/">came out in late August</a>, so it has been more than a month since Apple last released a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people will not have access to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta outside of Xcode, and it is not yet clear what Apple is adding in each &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is allowing developers to attend Vision Pro labs around the world, and developers who visit these locations are able to test the Vision Pro in person and get help from Apple engineers on their &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is not expected until early 2024, so Apple still has a lot of work to do on both hardware and software. We are expecting either this beta or a beta shortly after to introduce the official &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> that Apple has been working on.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-releases-visionos-beta-4/">Apple Continues Refining visionOS With Fourth Beta Release</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continues-refining-visionos-with-fourth-beta-release.2406138/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming one week after Apple released the first betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1.<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.1-On-iPhone-15-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915210" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 adds the option to favorite songs, albums, playlists, artists, and more, with favorited content added to the Library and used for suggestions. Favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen using the Now Playing widget, plus when starting a playlist, you'll now see Song Suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
AirDrop transfers can be finished over the internet so close proximity does not need to be maintained, and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 can now use NameDrop with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running iOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include a flashlight indicator in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> for non <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, and a Wallet feature that lets those in the UK connect their banks to see balances and transactions.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2406134/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.1 update to developers for beta testing, with the update coming just a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-first-beta-macos-sonoma-14-1/">launch of the first beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Registered developers can opt-in to the beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.1 includes updates for the Music app, introducing an option to favorite songs, albums, artists, and more. No other major new additions have been found in the beta as of yet, but there are several promised features that did not make it into the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that these features are coming in an update later this year, so we could begin seeing some of them in this beta.<br/>
<br/>
Additions we are waiting on include interactive Music widgets, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Sync improvements, the option to use Stickers through the Tapback menu in Messages, Intelligent form detection and Enhanced AutoFill for PDF documents and forms, an option to complete words by pressing the space bar, collaborative playlists in the Music app, and a favorite songs playlist.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-1-beta-2/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-1-to-developers.2406130/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>‌.1 update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌.1 Developer Beta.

Once beta updates have been activated, ‌watchOS 10.1‌ can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>

watchOS 10.1 adds NameDrop support for sharing contact information with another Apple Watch or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>

<br/>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. tvOS 17.1 adds a new favoriting option to the Music app on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of tvOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-tvos-17-1-to-developers.2406131/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
