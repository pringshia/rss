		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Pencil Pro has dropped to a new record low price today on Amazon, and we're also tracking a collection of discounts on the M4 iPad Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pencil Pro</h2><br/>

<br/>
Amazon today has the Apple Pencil Pro for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;119.00</strong></a>, down from the regular price of &#36;129.00. Although this is only a &#36;10 discount, it's now the lowest price we've tracked on the brand new Apple Pencil Pro among the major online retailers. The Apple Pencil 2 is also at an all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.00</strong></a> right now on Amazon.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in iOS 17 added a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-check-in-feature-ios-messages/">Check In feature to Messages</a> that allows you to let a loved one know when you've made it back home safely. With watchOS 11, Check In is also coming to Apple Watch, but it's not just in the Messages app that you can activate it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/check-in-workout-watchos-11.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956266" /><br/>
Anyone who has used a Garmin watch will probably be familiar with its LiveTrack feature, which creates a real-time view of your location during an activity, so friends and family can keep tabs on your progress. Strava Beacon offers similar functionality, and now with Check In integration, Apple Watch users can let loved ones know they have successfully completed their workout, too.<br/>
<br/>
Like on iPhone, Apple Watch users can start a Check In from Messages in watchOS 11. But the feature also works within the Workout app. When you start a workout, a swipe right reveals a new Check In option. So if you're walking home after dark or heading out for an early morning run, you can notify someone that you've started out, and Check In will let them know when you return home.<br/>
<br/>
If something unexpected happens and you get delayed, Check In will automatically notify your friend that you haven’t arrived as expected, and tell them your location (if available), the route you took, and your iPhone's battery level and cellular service in case they want to contact you.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a new option in Settings ➝ Workout that lets you turn on Check In Reminders, so Apple Watch can remind you to send a Workout Check In whenever you start an outdoor workout.<br/>
<br/>
Note that watchOS 11 is in developer beta, and some features could always change or be removed before Apple releases the new Apple Watch software to the public in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/watchos-11-supports-workout-check-in/">watchOS 11 Gets &#039;Check In&#039; Feature That Supports Outdoor Workouts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-gets-check-in-feature-that-supports-outdoor-workouts.2429597/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models running iOS 17.2 or later <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/record-spatial-video-iphone/">can record spatial video</a> with 3D depth for playback on Apple's Vision Pro headset. While spatial video recording has been limited to Apple's built-in Camera app until this point, third-party camera apps on the App Store can also offer this functionality starting on iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-iphone-15-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911686" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10166/">WWDC 2024 coding session</a> last week, Apple revealed that it has released an API that allows developers to offer spatial video recording in any app. Apple said the API is built into existing camera-related frameworks, making it easy to implement.<br/>
<br/>
When held in landscape orientation, the iPhone 15 Pro's main and ultra wide cameras combine to record spatial video. In addition to the iPhone 16 Pro models, it is likely that spatial video recording will be expanded to the regular iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, as the rear cameras on those devices are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">rumored to be vertically aligned</a>.<br/>
<br/>
You will need a Vision Pro to see the added depth in spatial videos, as they appear in a normal 2D format when played on an iPhone.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, Apple is introducing a new personalized AI experience called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence</a> that uses on-device, generative large-language models to enhance the user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-Apple-Intelligence-hero-240610.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954530" /><br/>
These new AI features require Apple's latest iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models to work, while only Macs and iPads with M1 or later chips will support Apple Intelligence. Since the news came to light, many users have been asking what the reason is for the cut-off.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2024/">The Talk Show Live From WWDC 2024</a>, <em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber put the question to Apple's AI/machine learning head John Giannandrea, marketing chief Greg Joswiak, and software engineering chief Craig Federighi, and this was the response.<br/>
<blockquote>Giannandrea: "So these models, when you run them at run times, it's called inference, and the inference of large language models is incredibly computationally expensive. And so it's a combination of bandwidth in the device, it's the size of the Apple Neural Engine, it's the oomph in the device to actually do these models fast enough to be useful. You could, in theory, run these models on a very old device, but it would be so slow that it would not be useful.<br/>
<br/>
Gruber: "So it's not a scheme to sell new iPhones?"<br/>
<br/>
Joswiak: "No, not at all. Otherwise, we would have been smart enough just to do our most recent iPads and Macs, too, wouldn't we?"</blockquote>Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi said that the company's first move with any new feature is to work out how to bring it back to older devices as far as possible. But when it comes to Apple Intelligence, "This is the hardware that it takes... It's a pretty extraordinary thing to run models of this power on an iPhone," he added.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro models use the A17 Pro chip, which has a 16-core Neural Engine that's up to 2x faster than the A16 chip found in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, performing nearly 35 trillion operations per second. Federighi hinted that RAM is also another aspect of the system that the new AI features require, so it is perhaps no coincidence that all the devices compatible with Apple Intelligence have at least 8GB of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the cutoff, owners of older iPhones still have plenty to look forward to in Apple's upcoming software update: iOS 18 boasts several new features besides Apple Intelligence, and every iPhone that can run iOS 17 is compatible iOS 18. That includes the iPhone XR from 2018.<br/>
<br/>
If you still want Apple Intelligence in your pocket but don't have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, you may want to hold out for the iPhone 16 series, which is expected to launch when iOS 18 is released in the fall. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/daringfireball-net/">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/apple-iphone-15-pro-requirement-apple-intelligence/">Apple Explains iPhone 15 Pro Requirement for Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-iphone-15-pro-requirement-for-apple-intelligence.2429589/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> has multiple touch and gesture capabilities that can enhance how you interact with apps. Some, like pinch and zoom, are well known enough to be considered second nature, but others are less obvious, like the one we're about to explain.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/multiple-select-gesture.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956201" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Two-Finger Drag to Select Items</h2><br/>
If have apps where you habitually tap on each individual item in a list to select them – emails in your Mail inbox, for example – it's time to dial in some efficiency and embrace this faster method.<br/>
<br/>
This gestural feature allows you to easily select (or deselect) multiple items in apps like Contacts, Mail, Messages, Voice Memos, Notes, and indeed any Apple app that lists multiple items. Here's how it works. <br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open an app where multiple item selection is supported.</li><br/>
  <li>Touch and hold the screen with two fingers at the same time.</li><br/>
  <li>While keeping both fingers on the screen, drag them down (or up) to select multiple items. As you drag, items will be highlighted to indicate they are selected.</li><br/>
  <li>Once the desired items are selected, you can perform actions such as moving, deleting, or organizing them.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/two-finger-select-gesture.jpg" alt="" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956202" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. This simple yet powerful feature streamlines your workflow, saving you time and effort when handling multiple items.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is facing a "number" of "very serious" issues with its Digital Markets Act compliance in Europe, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/apple-issues-very-serious-under-landmark-eu-rules-vestager.html">CNBC</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple in March to determine if Apple's EU app marketplace changes were complying with DMA regulations. The DMA requires Apple to provide developers with an option to distribute apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and without &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;'s fees. Apple implemented <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/apple-releases-ios-17-4/">support for app marketplaces</a> with iOS 17.4, but it charges an 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee for each download after the initial 1 million annual installs.<br/>
<br/>
Vestager does not believe that Apple's changes meet the requirements of the DMA. "We have a number of Apple issues; I find them very serious," she said. "I was very surprised that we would have such suspicions of Apple being non-compliant."<br/>
<br/>
She went on to say that this implementation "is not what was expected of such a company" and that the DMA rules will be enforced "exactly with the same top priority as with any other business."<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission plans to reveal the conclusions of its probe "hopefully soon," and if Apple is found to be violating the terms of the DMA, the European Union could levy significant fines up to five percent of its average daily worldwide revenue (upwards of &#36;1 billion).<br/>
<br/>
Last week, <em>Financial Times</em> said that the European Commission is planning to charge Apple for violating the Digital Markets Act. The EC believes that Apple is not complying with its obligation to allow developers to "steer" users outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; without fees.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does still have time to make changes to iOS before charges are announced by regulators, and the EC is expected to make an announcement in the "coming weeks."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-dma-issues-eu-rule-enforcement-soon/">Apple Has &#039;Very Serious&#039; DMA Issues, EU to Enforce Rules &#039;Soon&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-has-very-serious-dma-issues-eu-to-enforce-rules-soon.2429560/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Logitech today announced the launch of the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/tablet-keyboards/keys-to-go2-universal.html">Keys-To-Go 2</a>, a new portable wireless keyboard that's designed for tablets and mobile devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and it works as a lightweight alternative for those who do not want to invest in Apple's Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/logitech-keys-to-go.jpg" alt="" width="1390" height="782" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956153" /><br/>
The keyboard is designed to work as a standalone device, so it does not attach to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and you will need to pair it with a stand or smart cover for a Mac-like experience. Available in lilac, pale gray, graphite colors, the Keys-To-Go 2 is just under 10 inches long, four inches wide, and it weighs 7.84 ounces.<br/>
<br/>
There is a built-in cover that protects the keyboard during travel, keeping it safe from scratches and spills. It is equipped with scissor keys that have 1mm of travel for a comfortable typing experience, and there is an option to connect to up to three devices and swap between them quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Logitech designed the keyboard with two layouts, including a Universal layout and a dedicated Apple layout for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The top key row features several shortcut keys for adjusting volume, media playback, and screen brightness levels, as well as locking the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwwVUIILwJM" title="Powerfully Portable Tablet Keyboard | Introducing Keys-To-Go 2" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The keyboard pairs to an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; using Bluetooth, and there are replaceable coin cell batteries that Logitech says will last up to three years depending on usage.<br/>
<br/>
The Keys-To-Go 2 keyboard is priced at &#36;80 and it can be <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/tablet-keyboards/keys-to-go2-universal.920-012867.html">purchased from the Logitech website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/logitech/">Logitech</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/logitech-keys-to-go-2/">Logitech Launches &#039;Keys-To-Go 2&#039; Portable Keyboard for Tablets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/logitech-launches-keys-to-go-2-portable-keyboard-for-tablets.2429555/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today debuted <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/best-mac/">a new Mac website</a> that's designed to help potential customers find the ideal Mac. The "Help Me Choose" site asks users a few questions and then suggests the Mac that will best meet the user's needs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-help-me-choose-website.jpg" alt="" width="2040" height="1148" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956147" /><br/>
Questions include what the Mac will be used for, necessary day-to-day essentials, info on the user's creative pursuits, the need for portability, which peripherals will be used, and budget.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's algorithm for suggesting a Mac takes all of these factors into account, and it doesn't just present buyers with base configurations. It suggests upgrades to memory and storage that would be useful, and it will also present options if your selected budget is a little flexible.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/best-mac/">Help Me Choose website</a> can be found under the Mac section of Apple's website when selecting the "Compare" option or the "Shop Mac" and then "Shopping Guides" option.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-help-me-choose-mac-website/">Apple Launches &#039;Help Me Choose&#039; Website for Finding the Right Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-help-me-choose-website-for-finding-the-right-mac.2429549/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you were a kid who grew up using the internet in the early 2000s, there is a good chance that you heard of Habbo Hotel. Once a massively popular virtual world with millions of players, the game slowly died out over the years as the young teenagers who played it eventually became adults and moved on with life.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Habbo-Hotel-Origins.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1199" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956125" /><br/>
With the modern version of Habbo no longer offering the experience that older players remember, a classic version of the game has long been requested. And today, that wish finally became reality with the launch of <a href="https://origins.habbo.com/">Habbo Hotel Origins</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Habbo Hotel Origins is nearly a carbon copy of the game as it existed in 2005, complete with nostalgic features like the console for messaging friends, a purse for in-game credits, and a virtual hand that holds your in-game items (aka furni).<br/>
<br/>
"After discovering an old decrepit server with some long-lost files at the beginning of this year, over the past six months or so long-time Habbo developer and player Macklebee has lovingly restored an old version of Habbo Hotel first released in 2005," said Habbo, in a <a href="https://www.habbo.com/community/article/34151/launching-tomorrow-habbo-hotel-origins">blog post</a> announcing the launch of the game.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Habbo-Hotel-Origins-Welcome-Lounge.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956129" /><br/>
You'll need a new account to play Habbo Hotel Origins. To sign up, go to the <a href="https://origins.habbo.com/">origins.habbo.com</a> website, click on the "check-in" link on the left side of the page, download the Habbo client for macOS or Windows, and create an account within the game. Yes, that means you have another chance to secure a rare username that you missed out on as a kid. I snagged the username iPod, so feel free to send me a friend request!<br/>
<br/>
Once you have created an account, you can relive classic public rooms like the Welcome Lounge, Habbo Lido, and the Hallway. Many guest rooms have already popped up too, with players discussing their memories on the game.<br/>
<br/>
Just like in the good old days, Habbo Hotel Origins is available on desktop computers only. You must be 18+ to sign up for this version of the game, rather than 13 on regular Habbo, or even 11 in the earliest days. With many players woefully admitting they are in their 30s now, I suspect that isn't much of an issue. It's a fresh start for everyone, with blank rooms just asking to be decorated with Plasto chairs and Yukka plants.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/habbo-hotel-origins/">Habbo Launches Classic Version of Game on Mac in Throwback to 2005</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/habbo-launches-classic-version-of-game-on-mac-in-throwback-to-2005.2429541/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MacBook Pro models with an M4 chip are expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to display analyst Ross Young. In a <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1803118985153802370">tweet for subscribers</a>, Young said that panel shipments for new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are set to begin in the third quarter of 2024, which suggests a launch toward the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-Real-Feature-Red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950311" /><br/>
Apple started its M4 chip refresh in May with the launch of the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, but the first Macs with M4 chips are also slated for a 2024 launch. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple will refresh both the MacBook Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> lineups this year.<br/>
<br/>
The entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to get an M4 chip, while the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will be updated with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips. The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; will get M4 and M4 Pro chips. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> models won't be updated with M4 chips until 2025, and it is not yet clear when the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> might see an update with the refreshed chip technology.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's M4 chip is built on an upgraded 3-nanometer node, with Apple first introducing 3-nanometer technology with the M3 line. In Geekbench 6 benchmarks, the M4 chip is up to 25 percent faster than the M3 chip when it comes to multi-core performance, so we could see similar gains for the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from M4 chips, the upcoming MacBook Pro models are not expected to have significant feature updates. Apple is working on OLED display technology, but an OLED MacBook Pro is not expected until 2026 at the earliest.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/m4-macbook-pro-late-2024/">M4 MacBook Pro Models Expected to Launch in Late 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-macbook-pro-models-expected-to-launch-in-late-2024.2429538/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has suspended work on the second-generation Vision Pro headset to singularly focus on a cheaper model, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-suspends-work-on-next-high-end-headset-focused-on-releasing-cheaper-model-in-late-2025"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Vision-Pro-2-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2125" height="1195" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939912" /><br/>
Apple was widely believed to have plans to divide its Vision product line into two models, with one "Pro" model and one lower-cost standard model. The company is said to have been deprioritizing the next Vision Pro headset over the past year, gradually assigning fewer employees to the project.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first shifted focus to reducing the cost of the first-generation model's components and creating an upgraded display for the next model. Now, the company has apparently told at least one of its suppliers that it has suspended work on the next-generation of its Vision Pro headset. It still is continuing work on a more affordable "Vision" product with fewer features.<br/>
<br/>
The company purportedly began work on a cheaper Vision device in 2022 with the codename "N109." The objective is to sell this model for around the same price as a high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, which retails for up to &#36;1,600. At the time Apple began work on the device, it sought to release it at the end of 2024, but as of earlier this year, it still did not have a firm prototype. The company is said to have been struggling to find ways to reduce the model's costs without sacrificing too many features, which means that it will likely slip beyond its revised release date of the end of 2025. <br/>
<br/>
Apple apparently wants to retain the Vision Pro's high-end display components in the low-cost model, which are among the most expensive components in the device. <em>MacRumors</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/project-alaska-second-generation-vision-pro/">previously reported</a> that the cheaper model will feature the same high-end displays as the Vision Pro, but with fewer cameras, a simpler headband, and smaller speakers. Apple also wants to make its cheaper headset at least one-third lighter than the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
One supplier that makes key components for the Vision Pro apparently cut production by 50% in May after receiving a forecast from Apple that predicted weaker demand than expected. Information from this supplier suggests that Apple has produced no more than 500,000 Vision Pro units this year, with no plans to make significantly more than this through August.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em> says that it is still possible Apple will resume work on a second-generation Vision Pro headset at some point in the future.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2/">Apple Reportedly Suspends Work on Vision Pro 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2.2429526/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the watchOS 11 beta, the Activity app for Apple Watch lets you schedule custom activity goals for different days of the week, and also lets you pause your goals if you need to rest up.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchos-11-schedule-activity-goals.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956025" /><br/>
If you tap the +/- button when viewing your Move, Exercise, or Stand goals in the Activity app, a new Change Daily Goal option takes you to a schedule list for the days of the week, allowing you to set each one individually. <br/>
<br/>
So if you want to set custom workout goals for, say, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with lower goals during the weekend, you'll soon be able to do that. <br/>
<br/>
This schedule can also be managed through the Fitness app in iOS 18. The Move, Exercise, and Stand activity summaries include the same +/- button that lets you adjust the goal for just today, or adjust your schedule for each day of the week.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, if you tap the main Activity Rings display on Apple Watch, there's also a new Pause Rings option that mutes coaching and goal tracking while maintaining your Move streak. So if you're aiming for a streak and something unexpected upends your efforts (if you fall ill, for example) you can pause tracking without losing out and having to start again.<br/>
<br/>

You can initiate a pause for just today, until next week, for the whole month, or until a date of your choosing. Currently, you can pause your rings for up to 90 days and resume at any time.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 11 is in developer beta, so it's worth noting that some features could always change or be removed completely before Apple releases the new Apple Watch software in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/watchos-11-custom-activity-goals-different-days/">watchOS 11 Lets You Schedule Activity Goals for Each Day of the Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-lets-you-schedule-activity-goals-for-each-day-of-the-week.2429523/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">announcement</a> back in late April, the new <a href="https://www.beatsbydre.com/earbuds/ut-solo-buds-btd">Beats Solo Buds</a> earbuds are now available to order ahead of their launch later this week. Priced at &#36;79.99, the Solo Buds offer 18 hours of battery life right in the buds themselves and come in the smallest case ever for a Beats earphone product.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8qdEm4Zzq4?si=VSFb-fVBenOXP8HY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
We've had a chance to spend a few days with the Beats Solo Buds, and we've been pretty impressed with what you get for that budget price point. These are true wireless earbuds with a similar design and fit as the more expensive Studio Buds +, but without some of the more advanced features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), Transparency, hands-free "Hey <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>" support, and auto play/pause ear detection. There's also no official sweat and water resistance rating, although they should still stand up pretty well to everyday usage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-solo-buds-video-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955952" /><br/>
Even without ANC, the in-ear fit of the Solo Buds does a pretty good job of blocking out exterior noise compared to the standard AirPods that don't seal in the ear canal, and the audio quality is surprisingly good though definitely a notch below higher-end options. Four ear tip sizes ranging from XS to L are included, so most users should be able to find a good fit and we thought they were reasonably comfortable even during extended usage sessions. Support for Spatial Audio is included, but head-tracking is not.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-solo-buds-video-7.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955959" /><br/>
The tiny case for the Solo Buds is possible due to the fact that it carries no internal battery of its own, meaning it serves only as a storage case and mechanism for charging the buds themselves when they run out of battery. A USB-C port on the back of the case delivers the charge to the buds, but with 18 hours of battery in the buds, you should be good for multiple days of listening before you need to plug the case in to charge them back up. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-solo-buds-video-3.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955954" /><br/>
With no battery on board the case, the whole package is extremely light, weighing under 35 grams with the buds inside. The case is slightly wider than an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> case and about the same thickness, but it's significantly shorter, which makes it even more pocketable, and the flat bottom makes it easy to stand the case up for convenience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-solo-buds-video-4.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955955" /><br/>
The iconic "b" logo button is present on both buds, and the default functions include the usual press for play/pause, double press to skip forward, and triple press to skip backward. For phone calls, a single press answers a call, while a double tap either ends or rejects a call. A single press and hold on the button activates &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, but you can customize that gesture in the Settings app so that the two earbuds control volume up and down if you prefer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-solo-buds-video-5.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955956" /><br/>
While there's no Apple W or H chip onboard, the proprietary Beats chip platform supports a number of native Apple features such as one-touch pairing with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> syncing across your devices, automatic audio handoff to your Apple Watch when you go out of range of your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> support for the last known connected location, and audio sharing. Android users get many of the same features including one-touch pairing with device syncing via your Google account, &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Device support, and audio switching with multi-point pairing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-solo-buds-video-6.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955957" /><br/>
Overall, the Beats Solo Buds are shaping up to be a great budget earphone pick if you don't need the features present on more expensive options. The 18-hour battery life right in the buds is certainly convenient, and they're supremely portable with their light and tiny case.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to more subdued Matte Black and Storm Gray colors, the Solo Buds are also available in an Arctic Purple shade that's exclusive to Apple and Target in the U.S., plus a Transparent Red that lets you see into the case a bit. All four colors are <a href="https://www.beatsbydre.com/earbuds/ut-solo-buds-btd">available to order now for &#36;79.99</a>, with a launch following this Thursday, June 20.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/beats-solo-buds-orders/">Beats Solo Buds Now Available to Order: 18-Hour Battery and a Tiny Case for &#36;79.99</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-solo-buds-now-available-to-order-18-hour-battery-and-a-tiny-case-for-79-99.2429516/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is set to conclude a lengthy antitrust investigation by the European Union into its mobile payments system by making significant concessions to give competitors access to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s NFC technology, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb939c62-4e24-4ffa-8125-b60120c4776e"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/apple-card-via-apple-pay.jpeg" alt="" width="1524" height="909" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-843215" /><br/>
The European Commission charged Apple in 2022 with violating competition law, contending that Apple was preventing competitors from accessing its near-field communication (NFC) technology to favor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>. In response to these charges, Apple apparently made several commitments to the European Commission in January, which now appear to have satisfied the regulators.<br/>
<br/>
Citing sources familiar with the matter, the <em>Financial Times</em> claims that Apple agreed to provide third-party developers with open access to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s NFC. This access is said to not require the use of &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; or Apple Wallet, effectively allowing competitors to create their own contactless payment solutions. London-based payment app Curve has already expressed interest in implementing its own NFC system on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; once the agreement is official. Apple reportedly pledged to maintain this openness for a decade.<br/>
<br/>
The settlement, which is expected to be finalized over the next few weeks, should help Apple avoid a potential fine by the EU that could have been as high as 10% of the company's global annual revenue. Given Apple's reported revenue of &#36;383 billion in 2023, the fine could have amounted to approximately &#36;40 billion. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ft-com/">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/">NFC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/eu-satisfied-with-plans-to-open-iphones-nfc-chip/">EU Reportedly Satisfied With Apple&#039;s Plans to Open iPhone&#039;s NFC Chip to Rivals</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-reportedly-satisfied-with-apples-plans-to-open-iphones-nfc-chip-to-rivals.2429512/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The Compact view looks similar to the standard view in iOS 17, with events indicated by dots (but now colored to indicate which calendar they belong to), while the Stacked view displays each day's events as long thin pills on top of each other. <br/>
<br/>

The new Details view shows the title of every event across the month. One neat additional touch here is that you can use a pinch to zoom gesture to expand or reduce the calendar and create more or less space between the days to view more items. This action also gradually switches between the Compact, Stacked, and Details views. Elsewhere, the List view should be familiar, and shows the month with the selected day's events listed below.<br/>
<br/>

In the Today view, you can now switch between a Single Day or Multi Day view, with the latter providing details of all the day's events alongside any upcoming events for the following day.<br/>
<br/>
When you tap the + icon in the top-right corner, a "New" card appears where you can switch between "Event" and "Reminder" tabs at the top. Reminders now appear in your calendar views, where you can mark them as completed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/reminders-in-calendar.jpg" alt="" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956004" /><br/>
You can also tap a reminder to get a Reminder Details screen, which includes the associated reminder list, plus a link to view that item within the Reminders app. There's also an Edit button in the top-right of the Reminder Details screen, which lets you change everything about the reminder that you can in Reminders, except without you having to leave the Calendar app.<br/>

iOS 18 is currently in beta for Apple Developer Program members, with a public beta to follow in July. The update should be widely released in September, but bear in mind that Apple could always make Calendar app changes based on feedback before then.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/calendar/">Calendar</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/ios-18-whats-new-in-the-calendar-app/">iOS 18: Calendar App Design Changes and Reminders Integration</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-calendar-app-design-changes-and-reminders-integration.2429510/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced plans to introduce new AI curriculum at its Apple Developer Academy locations in Brazil, Indonesia, Italy, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and the United States. Apple Developer Academy students and mentors will learn about tools and technologies that take advantage of artificial intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-developer-academy.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955950" /><br/>
The AI curriculum is being added to the program as a foundational skill, and students will learn how to build, train, and deploy machine learning models on Apple devices. Some of the available courses include the fundamentals of AI technologies, Core ML, and training AI models from the ground up.<br/>
<blockquote>"At Apple, we see coding as a universal language and believe in empowering developers, creators, and entrepreneurs across the world with tools and technologies that will allow them to create phenomenal experiences," said Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. "With the introduction of curriculum dedicated to AI and other new technologies, we're excited to see what students will build to share with their communities and the world."</blockquote><br/>
Apple Developer Academy students, mentors, and alumni will have access to the curriculum starting this fall.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-academy/">Apple Developer Academy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-developer-academy-ai-training/">Apple Offers Students AI Training at Developer Academies</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-offers-students-ai-training-at-developer-academies.2429508/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[T9 dialing, or Text on 9 keys, is a predictive text technology that emerged in the late 90s to make it easier to type text messages on devices with limited input options, such as traditional mobile phones with numeric keypads. Each number key (2-9) on a T9 keypad is mapped to a set of letters. For example, the key "2" corresponds to "ABC," "3" to "DEF," and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/t9-dialing-phone-keypad-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955980" /><br/>
Android phones have had the feature for years, and in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> beta, Apple has finally added T9 dialing support to the Phone App. So now you can type a contact's name using the number pad, and matching contacts will appear above the keypad.<br/>
<br/>
When you press a key, T9 doesn't just consider the individual letters that the key represents but predicts the most likely word you are trying to type. In the same way, &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; combines all possible letter combinations to filter results from your contacts. To bring up your Dad's number, for example, you would tap 3-2-3 (D-A-D). Or if you have someone called Ben in your contacts, tapping 2-3-6 (B-E-N) should bring up their number.<br/>
<br/>
The best match appears first above the keypad, and tapping the person's name will call them. If there are several possible matches in your contacts, they can be revealed as a list by tapping "X more..." below the first match. Taken together, the new options should enable faster calling.<br/>
<br/>

In addition, when you type in a new number into the keypad in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, it now gives you two options to add it to your contacts. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, a single "Add number" option appears above the keypad, whereas in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; there is a new button in the top-left corner that reveals "Create New Contact" and "Add to Existing Contact."<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is currently in beta for Apple Developer Program members, with a public beta to follow in July.

		<title>U.S. Government Sues Adobe for Hidden Termination Fees When Canceling Subscription</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission today <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-files-complaint-against-adobe-and-two-adobe-executives-alleged-violations">levied a lawsuit against Adobe</a> [<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1356176/dl?inline">PDF</a>] for imposing a hidden termination fee on subscribers who want to cancel their Adobe plans. Adobe is accused of forcing subscribers to "navigate a complex and challenging cancellation process designed to deter them from cancelling subscriptions they no longer wanted."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/adobe-creative-cloud-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950293" /><br/>
Adobe offers its Creative Cloud products on a subscription basis, with fees that are paid monthly. A monthly payment suggests that it's possible to cancel anytime, but that's not how Adobe works because most customers are actually locked into a hidden annual agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who sign up for a free trial and are then charged and signed up to the default Creative Cloud plan, which is actually an annual contract. Canceling the annual contract requires customers to pay a lump sum of 50 percent of the "remaining contractual obligation" to cancel, despite the fact that service ends that month.<br/>
<br/>
Adobe <em>does</em> let customers sign up for a month-to-month subscription plan, but at a higher cost than the annual contract that's paid monthly, and the difference is not always clear to new or existing customers. Adobe even has <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/creative-cloud-subscription-terms.html">a whole help page</a> because of the confusing nature of its subscription. If you look at the Adobe website, for example, Adobe lists a &#36;60/month fee for accessing its full suite of apps, but that's only if you agree to the annual contract. A true month-to-month plan that you can cancel anytime is &#36;90/month, and if you pay for a year upfront, you get no money back when you cancel after a 14-day period.<br/>
<br/>
According to the DoJ, Adobe's setup violates the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act (ROSCA) through the use of fine print and inconspicuous hyperlinks to hide information about the Early Termination Fee.<br/>
<blockquote>The complaint alleges that for years, Adobe has profited from this hidden fee, misleading consumers about the true costs of a subscription and ambushing them with the fee when they try to cancel, wielding the fee as a powerful retention tool.<br/>
<br/>
The complaint alleges that Adobe has further violated ROSCA by failing to provide consumers with a simple mechanism to cancel their recurring, online subscriptions. Instead, Adobe allegedly protects its subscription revenues by thwarting subscribers' attempts to cancel, subjecting them to a convoluted and inefficient cancellation process filled with unnecessary steps, delays, unsolicited offers and warnings.</blockquote><br/>
The lawsuit asks for "unspecified amounts of consumer redress" along with monetary civil penalties and a permanent injunction that would prevent Adobe from continuing to use hidden fees to thwart customer cancelations.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ftc/">FTC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/adobe/">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/doj/">DOJ</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/us-government-sues-adobe-hidden-fees/">U.S. Government Sues Adobe for Hidden Termination Fees When Canceling Subscription</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-government-sues-adobe-for-hidden-termination-fees-when-canceling-subscription.2429478/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
