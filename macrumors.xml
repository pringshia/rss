		<title>iOS 17.4 Nerfs Web Apps in the EU</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has seemingly restricted the functionality of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in the latest beta of iOS 17.4, specifically targeting users within the European Union. The move appears to undermine the role of PWAs as viable alternatives to native apps in iOS.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932464" /><br/>
As first flagged by <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/did-apple-just-break-web-apps-in-ios17.4-beta-eu/">Open Web Advocacy</a>, the second beta release of iOS 17.4 seems to introduce changes that put web apps at a significant disadvantage in Europe. The new beta version of iOS prevents these apps from launching in their own top-level window that takes up the entire screen, relegating them instead to open within Safari, a change that significantly impacts their user experience and functionality. The move effectively demotes PWAs to mere website shortcuts.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when a user in Europe taps a web app icon, they will see a system message asking if they wish to open it in Safari or cancel. The message adds that the web app "will open in your default browser from now on." When opened in Safari, the web app opens like a bookmark, with no dedicated windowing, notifications, or long-term local storage. Users have seen issues with existing web apps such as data loss, since the Safari version can no longer access local data, as well as broken notifications.<br/>
<br/>
Progressive Web Apps are designed to offer a user experience comparable to that of native apps using web technologies, with the potential for users to add them directly to their home screen with no need for an app store. The latest change is particularly controversial because historically Apple has suggested that developers who are unwilling to comply with its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> guidelines could instead focus on web apps. Now, the company's recent adjustments appear to contradict this stance by limiting the capabilities of PWAs and their ability to compete with native applications in iOS, raising questions about its commitment to supporting web technologies as a viable alternative to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
This development comes amid Apple's moves to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to promote competition and regulate the practices of digital "gatekeepers." Apple's decision to alter the functionality of PWAs specifically in the EU could be interpreted as an attempt to navigate the regulatory landscape imposed by the DMA, but it may simply want to prevent users in Europe from using web apps with alternative browser engines. The company has not yet commented on its motivations.<br/>
<br/>
There are indications that iOS 17.4 is using SIM carrier information to geo-lock the changes to web app functionality singularly to users in the EU. Web apps in other regions around the world remain unaffected.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu/">iOS 17.4 Nerfs Web Apps in the EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu.2418904/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple and other top tech companies have joined a new U.S. consortium to support the safe and responsible development and deployment of generative AI, the Commerce Department announced on Thursday (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/top-ai-companies-join-government-effort-to-set-safety-standards">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/NIST-AI-consortium.jpg" alt="" width="3900" height="2323" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935590" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-safety-institute">NIST</a></em></div><br/>
Apple, along with OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon, will join more than 200 members of the AI Safety Institute Consortium (AISIC) under the department, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.<br/>
<br/>
"The U.S. government has a significant role to play in setting the standards and developing the tools we need to mitigate the risks and harness the immense potential of artificial intelligence," Raimondo said in a statement.<br/>
<br/>
The group will work with the department's National Institute of Standards and Technology on priority actions outlined in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">President Biden's AI executive order</a>, "including developing guidelines for red-teaming, capability evaluations, risk management, safety and security, and watermarking synthetic content."<br/>
<br/>
Other technology companies, as well as civil society groups, academics, and state and local government officials, will also be involved to establish safety standards regarding AI regulation. <br/>
<br/>
Generative AI has spurred excitement due to its potential to enhance creativity, improve efficiency, and advance technology. However, fears surrounding generative AI include ethical concerns like deepfakes, the potential impact on jobs, issues around information reliability, and challenges in ensuring privacy and effective regulation. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be spending <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">millions of dollars a day</a> on AI research as training large language models requires a lot of hardware. Apple is on track to spend <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-ai-server-spending-2024/">more than &#36;4 billion</a> on AI servers in 2024, according to one report.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">developing its own generative AI model</a> called "Ajax". Designed to rival the likes of OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4, Ajax operates on 200 billion parameters, suggesting a high level of complexity and capability in language understanding and generation. Internally known as "Apple GPT," Ajax aims to unify machine learning development across Apple, suggesting a broader strategy to integrate AI more deeply into Apple's ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
Aspects of the model could be incorporated into iOS 18, such as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">enhanced version of Siri</a> with ChatGPT-like generative AI functionality. Both <em>The Information</em> and analyst Jeff Pu claim that Apple will have some kind of generative AI feature available on the ‌iPhone‌ and iPad <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">later this year</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/apple-ai-safety-institute-consortium/">Apple Joins US Commerce Department&#039;s AI Safety Institute Consortium</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-joins-us-commerce-departments-ai-safety-institute-consortium.2418893/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Waterfield has announced its own <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/vision-pro-shield-case">Vision Pro Shield Case</a>, a more compact alternative to Apple's official <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2F3LL/A/apple-vision-pro-travel-case">&#36;199 Travel Case</a> for the company's new headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/waterfield-apple-vision-pro-case.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935581" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple's Vision Pro Travel Case (left) versus Waterfield case</em></div><br/>
At half the size of Apple's case, Waterfield says its Shield Case travels more easily, while still providing the necessary protection and capacity for organizing and carrying related accessories in transit. It achieves this by taking advantage of the Vision Pro's detachable parts.<br/>
<blockquote>WaterField leveraged the ease with which the Vision Pro head straps can be removed to significantly reduce the size of its Vision Pro Shield Case. The new Apple headset, with its front cover on, sits cradled on one side, and a padded accessory pouch — for the charger, cables, cleaning cloth, one or both head straps, and Zeiss lenses in Ultrasuede® pockets — rests perfectly inside the curve of the headset on the other. This design not only saves space but also keeps the headset firmly in place, and the pouch's padding adds yet another extra layer of protection.</blockquote><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/waterfield-vision-pro-case.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935578" /><br/>
<br/>
A padded battery pocket under the flap is positioned to keep the battery's weight away from the headset (users can detach the battery from the cable using a SIM tray ejector tool), while an external zippered pocket can be used for additional accessories and includes a stealth <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> pocket.<br/>
<br/>
The 5-liter case is surrounded by impact-resistant closed-cell foam and lined with a padded fleece. A dual-sided waterproof YKK zipper surrounds the case on three sides and is backed by a fleece bumper, which shields the contents from the zipper. There's also a low-profile handle on the case, and D-rings for hooking an optional shoulder strap.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will not have to face an investor lawsuit accusing it of overpaying CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and other top executives by tens of millions of dollars, after a federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the case (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-defeats-lawsuit-claiming-it-overpaid-ceo-tim-cook-others-2024-02-07/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Tim-Cook-WWDC-Stage.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894652" /><br/>
The plaintiff, a pension fund affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said Apple in 2021 and 2022 awarded a respective &#36;92.7 million and &#36;94 million to Cook and four other executives by improperly calculating the value of performance-based stock awards.  The plaintiff argued its compensation committee intended to award just &#36;77.5 million each year.<br/>
<br/>
The alleged error was attributed by the pension fund's lawyers to the committee's improper calculation of the restricted stock unit's "fair values" at the time of the grants, and said it misled shareholders who would be casting advisory votes on executive compensation, known as "say-on-pay."<br/>
<br/>
U.S. District Judge Jennifer Rochon disagreed, however,  saying Apple described its pay methods in detailed compensation tables in its 2023 proxy statement "precisely," as securities laws and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require.<br/>
<br/>
The Manhattan judge also found no proof that Apple's board of directors acted improperly in awarding pay, and said the plaintiff did not give the board enough time to consider its objections before suing.<br/>

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the Swiss Confederation and Sweden began receiving notifications about cycling directions overnight. &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; provides cycling directions along bike lanes, bike paths, and bike-friendly roads wherever possible, including details like steep inclines, how busy a street is, and whether there are stairs or other obstacles along a route. <br/>
<br/>
If you have an Apple Watch, voice guidance and haptic feedback also make it easier to stay focused on your direction of travel.<br/>
<br/>
Cycling directions came to &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; in iOS 14, and are also available across the United States, China, and Japan, as well as in select major cities around the world, such as London, Barcelona, and Toronto. Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#maps-cycling">maintains a list</a> of all of the areas where cycling directions are available on its website, but as of writing this, it has not yet been updated to include Switzerland and Sweden.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A security researcher who reported bugs to Apple was arrested in January for defrauding the company out of millions of dollars, according to a report from <a href="https://www.404media.co/security-researcher-allegedly-hacked-apples-backend-scammed-2-5-million/"><em>404 Media</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/bug-security-vulnerability-issue-fix-larry.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896108" /><br/>
The researcher, Noah Roskin-Frazee, was accused alongside a co-conspirator obtaining over &#36;3 million in products and services through more than two dozen fraudulent orders. That included around &#36;2.5 million in gift cards and over &#36;100,000 in "products and services."<br/>
<br/>
While Apple is not explicitly named in the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24412154-noah-roskin-frazee?ref=404media.co">court records</a>, an unnamed "Company A" is located in Cupertino, California, and is clearly Apple. The court mentions that one of the perpetrators used gift cards to "purchase Final Cut Pro on Company A's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>," and Apple is the only company that sells the software.<br/>
<br/>
In 2019, Frazee and his accomplice used a password reset tool to gain access to an employee account that belonged to an unnamed "Company B," which does customer support for Apple. That account led to access to additional employee credentials, and Frazee accessed Company B's VPN servers. From there, Frazee was able to get into Apple's systems, placing fraudulent orders for Apple products.<br/>
<br/>
He used Apple's "Toolbox" program that could be used to edit orders after they were placed, and he changed order values to zero, added products to orders, and extended <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> contracts. He abused Apple's program from January to March 2019.<br/>
<blockquote>The defendants remoted into computers located in India and Costa Rica as part of the scheme, the indictment adds. The scam itself involved changing order monetary values to zero, adding products to existing orders without cost such as phones and laptops, and extending existing service contracts, the indictment adds. That included extending a customer service contract that was associated with one of the defendants and his family for an extra two years without paying.</blockquote><br/>
Apple thanked Frazee for in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214036">January support document</a> for finding several bugs in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, and the document was published less than two weeks after he was arrested. "We would like to acknowledge Noah Roskin-Frazee and Prof. J. (ZeroClicks.ai Lab) for their assistance," reads Apple's page in reference to a Wi-Fi vulnerability.<br/>
<br/>
Frazee has been charged with wire fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, and intentional damage to a protected computer. He will be required to forfeit all of the stolen goods, and he could be sentenced to more than 20 years in jail if convicted.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/security-researcher-apple-theft/">Security Researcher Allegedly Exploited Internal Apple Tool to Steal Millions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/security-researcher-allegedly-exploited-internal-apple-tool-to-steal-millions.2418847/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began offering <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">refurbished versions</a> of the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip, offering the machines at a discount for the first time since their October 2023 launch date.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/macbook-pro-bb-cyber.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924141" /><br/>
Pricing on the refurbished 14-inch MacBook Pro models starts at &#36;1,359, a &#36;240 discount off of the original &#36;1,599 starting price.<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, Apple appears to be offering only MacBook Pro models with the standard M3 chip, with no M3 Pro or M3 Max machines available for purchase. Apple has several configurations listed with additional storage space.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the entry-level models have already sold out, and availability will fluctuate as Apple restocks the refurbished store. Customers looking for a specific configuration should check back often.<br/>
<br/>
All of Apple's refurbished Macs are close to identical to new products. They are subject to a refurbishment process that includes full functionality testing, with any defective modules replaced, as well as a thorough cleaning and inspection. Refurbished products are eligible for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ and have the same 14-day return period as new Apple devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro/">Apple Now Selling Refurbished 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro.2418844/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new iOS 17.4 update that brings some major changes to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> (and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>) in Europe. Some of the biggest updates are only going to update people in the European Union, but there are also plenty of features in iOS 17.4 that are available worldwide. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In this article, we've rounded up everything new so far in iOS 17.4. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="eu_changes">EU Changes</h2><br/>
Apple implemented notable changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act. These changes are included in iOS 17.4, but are limited to countries that are in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833990" /><br/>
<h3 id="alternative_app_stores_and_new_app_store_terms">Alternative App Stores and New App Store Terms</h3><br/>
App developers in the EU can opt to offer alternative app stores or install their apps through alternative stores, and Apple has a whole new fee structure that goes along with this change. There's a new business structure that developers can opt in to, which applies to both apps distributed in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and apps that are distributed through alternative means.<br/>
<br/>
App developers using the new system will need to pay a standard fee of 0.50 euros per user per year, with the first million installs offered for free. Apps distributed through alternative app stores will have no commission. Apps distributed through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will pay a reduced 17 percent commission, or 10 percent for those in the small business program or for user subscriptions older than a year.<br/>
<br/>
Developers can choose not to opt in to the new system and can use the existing system with the same 15/30 percent commission that's available elsewhere in the world. Apple has a fee calculator to help developers determine what they'll pay with the existing setup, with the new setup, with the new setup using alternative app stores, and with the new setup using the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Users are able to set their preferred alternative app store as the default app store on their device if desired. EU users will see an option for this in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
There are a huge number of behind-the-scene changes that are enabling this feature in the EU, with updates to all kinds of system messaging. Users in the EU will, for example, get a pop up warning when an app from an alternative app store contains malware, and there are new screens for verifying the information from an alternative app.<br/>
<br/>
A Screen Time setting will allow parents to decide whether their children's devices are able to install apps from alternative app marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="alternative_payment_options">Alternative Payment Options</h2><br/>
Apple is also allowing apps to use alternative payment options in their apps, and there is no longer a requirement to use in-app purchase. Developers who distribute apps through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and use an alternative payment option will see a three percent discount in their &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fees.<br/>
<br/>
Developers who distribute through alternative apps and also use an alternative payment option will pay Apple no fees beyond the set 0.50 euro fee per user.<br/>
<br/>
With alternative payments, purchases for digital goods and services can be made directly in an app or a developer can choose to link to their website to have a user make a payment. Apple is requiring developers to use a known, secure payment provider.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="third-party_browser_updates">Third-Party Browser Updates</h3><br/>
After updating to iOS 17.4, EU users that open Safari will see a pop up that allows them to choose a new default browser option from a list of the most popular browsers on iOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also allowing alternative browser engines, and will not limit browsers like Chrome to the WebKit engine.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="nfc_access">NFC Access</h3><br/>
Third-party payment apps and banks have access to the NFC chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in iOS 17.4, and can offer contactless payments directly on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or the Wallet app in the European Economic Area. Users can set a default contactless payment provider that activates at tap-to-pay terminals or when the Side button on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is pressed twice.<br/>
<br/>
The option for setting a default contactless payment provider is available in the Settings app in the EU, and this section will also provide details on all apps that have requested and been granted contactless payment access.<br/>
<br/>
EU users can also change the default Wallet app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="gaming_app_changes">Gaming App Changes</h2><br/>
Streaming game apps are now allowed on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; worldwide, which means services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW can be offered as standalone &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously only allowed cloud gaming services to be offered via the web, but dedicated apps that let users stream games from servers are now permitted.<br/>
<br/>
Mini-app, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins are also now able to use the in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_emoji">New Emoji</h2><br/>
The iOS 17.4 beta adds new emoji characters that include lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-New-Emoji-Feature-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1077" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932812" /><br/>
These emoji are part of the Unicode 15.1 update that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ios-17-future-emoji/">approved in September 2023</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messaging_with_siri">Messaging with Siri</h2><br/>
The Automatically Send Messages setting under <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> & Search has been renamed "Messaging with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;," and there is an option to set &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to read incoming messages in a specific language like Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and many more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-messaging-with-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932819" /><br/>
The change does not update the primary language that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; listens in and responds to, but is limited to message playback.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="podcasts_and_music">Podcasts and Music</h2><br/>
The "Listen Now" tabs in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and Podcasts have been renamed to "Home."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-music-home.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932818" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="podcast_transcripts">Podcast Transcripts</h2><br/>
The Podcasts app now offers transcripts, similar to how lyrics work in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/podcast-app-transcript.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932875" /><br/>
Podcasts also uses the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Now Playing bar when collapsed. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2><br/>
The URL/search bar in Safari is now wider than it was before.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-wider-safari-url-bar.jpg" alt="" width="2807" height="1579" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932817" /><br/>
<h2 id="stolen_device_protection">Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
In the Stolen Device Protection section of the Settings app, there is now an option to require a security delay always or only when away from familiar locations. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932874" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="next-generation_carplay_support">Next-Generation CarPlay Support</h2><br/>
Next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> is set to launch in the U.S. later in 2024, and code in iOS 17.4 references eight new &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; apps. <br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Car Camera:</strong> This app will display the vehicle's rear-view camera feed.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> For electric vehicles, this app will display battery level, charging status, time remaining until the battery is fully charged, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Climate:</strong> This app will provide access to a vehicle's climate controls within &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heating system, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Closures:</strong> This app will display if any of the vehicle's doors are opened, and it might also display vehicle warning symbols.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> This app will provide access to FM and AM radio station controls within &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, along with other media options like SiriusXM. It is unclear if SiriusXM will offer satellite connectivity, or remain limited to internet streaming. Users will be able to select from a list of music genres, such as Top 40 and Rock.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Tire Pressure:</strong> This app will display air pressure for each of the vehicle's tires, and provide low pressure, high pressure, and flat tire warnings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Trips:</strong> This app will provide a variety of driving-related data, including the vehicle's average speed, fuel efficiency or energy efficiency, the total time elapsed and distance traveled on a trip, and more.</li></ul>An image in iOS 17.4 beta suggests that &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will also likely display a "Goodbye" screen after the driver shuts off the vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Goodbye.jpg" alt="" width="1374" height="484" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932992" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="shareplay">SharePlay</h2><br/>
SharePlay music control <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/">is expanding</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> with iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4. With the feature, a user's family and friends can control the music that is playing on a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, so long as the user has granted permission.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933114" /><br/>
The person who owns the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; needs to have an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription, but the person who is granted SharePlay access can play music using &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; without a subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Connecting to a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; to use SharePlay can be done by scanning a QR code on the device owner's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (for &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;) or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. Users can connect to a device while in the same space or remotely.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="stopwatch_live_activity">Stopwatch Live Activity</h2><br/>
iOS 17.4 adds a Live Activity function for the Stopwatch feature on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. When activated through the Clock app, the Stopwatch now shows up in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and on the Lock Screen. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stopwatch.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933379" /><br/>
There are controls for pausing the Stopwatch, clearing it, and starting a new lap. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_tv_app">Apple TV App</h2><br/>
The "How to Watch" section in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app that shows where a movie or TV show can be viewed now has a list interface rather than a card interface. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-how-to-watch.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933405" /><br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Media platform Plex <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/welcome-to-rental-land-on-plex/">today announced</a> the launch of a dedicated movie rental store, allowing U.S. Plex users to purchase content directly from Plex rather than from a third-party store like YouTube, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, or Amazon Video.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/plex-movie-rental-store.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935551" /><br/>
Popular movies like Barbie, Aquaman, Mission Impossible, Wonka, Priscilla, and more can be purchased using Plex.<br/>
<br/>
Plex users will have 30 days to start playback after renting a movie, and once playback begins, the movie can be watched multiple times in a 48-hour window.<br/>
<br/>
Along with recent movies to purchase, Plex also offers a large selection of movies that are available to watch for free on demand (with ads), as well as free live television.<br/>
<br/>
Plex movies can be rented through the Plex Web App on iOS devices, but purchases work on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, iOS, the Plex Web App, Fire TV, and supported smart TVs from LG, Samsung, and more. Plex does not support renting movies directly on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, presumably to avoid Apple's cut.<br/>
<br/>
Rentals start at &#36;3.99 for older movies, but popular new releases cost up to &#36;20.99. Wonka, for example, is &#36;20.99, which is actually a dollar more than it costs to rent the movie from Apple's TV app. There is no option to purchase movies on Plex, and rented movies cannot be downloaded. <br/>
<br/>
Movie rentals are limited to the United States as of now, and Plex has not said whether the renting option will expand to additional countries.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/plex/">Plex</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/plex-launches-movie-rental-store/">Plex Launches Movie Rental Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/plex-launches-movie-rental-store.2418836/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 188 includes fixes and updates for Accessibility, Animations, Browser Changes, CSS, Forms, Loading, Lockdown Mode, Media, Rendering, Scrolling, Storage, SVG, Web API, Web Extensions, WebAuthn, WebGL, and WebRTC.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-188/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 188 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-188-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2418834/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, you can make hand gestures during video calls in the FaceTime app and other video conferencing apps to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-reaction-effects-facetime/">fill the screen with 3D effects</a>. For example, you can hold two thumbs up to show fireworks on the screen, or make two peace signs with your hands to show confetti.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/ios-17-facetime-effects.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1070" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900390" /><br/>
Unfortunately, many users are unaware that this new feature is turned on by default, leading to some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23916475/apple-video-reactions-telehealth-therapy-awkward-simplepractice">awkward and embarrassing moments</a> during important video calls, such as online therapy sessions and business meetings.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Apple has come up with a solution.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4, Apple is releasing a new API that allows video conferencing apps to turn off the gesture-based reactions by default in their apps, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>. We have not yet confirmed if Apple has also made the API available for macOS 14.4.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, and macOS 14.4 are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-beta-2/">currently in beta</a>, and the software updates are expected to be released in March.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and Apple Devices apps that Apple has been testing for Windows machines <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210384#619">have officially launched</a>, ending a long preview period and bringing an end to the iTunes app on some computers.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-880559" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/apple-music-preview-microsoft-store.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, and Apple Devices app are part of Apple's effort to split iTunes on PC into multiple platforms to mirror how these apps work on Macs. On Windows 10 and later, PC customers can download the three separate apps to manage devices and access &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; content.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/12/apple-music-apple-tv-icloud-photos-windows/">first announced plans</a> for &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; apps for the Microsoft Store back in October 2022, so the split from iTunes has been in the works for more than a year.<br/>
<br/>
Standalone <a class ="ads noskim" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PFHDD62MXS1?rtc=1&hl=en-us&gl=us">Apple Music</a>, <a class ="ads noskim" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NP83LWLPZ9K?hl=en-us&gl=US">Apple Devices</a>, and <a class ="ads noskim" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NM4T8B9JQZ1?hl=en-us&gl=US">Apple TV</a> apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/apple-music-tv-previews-microsoft-store/">launched in a preview capacity</a> in January 2023, and Apple has been making regular updates since then. As of today, the "Preview" label has been removed from the three Windows apps.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app gives Windows users a way to listen to and manage music from their iTunes library, including iTunes Store purchases, while the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app allows users to watch and manage movies and TV shows from iTunes. Both of the apps also give access to Apple's streaming services, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Devices app is designed to allow PC owners to update, back up, and restore and manage their iPhones and iPads, and sync content from their PCs.<br/>
<br/>
Using the standalone apps requires Windows 10 or later, and all three apps must be installed to transition away from iTunes. After the apps have been added to a PC, iTunes is used only to access podcasts and audiobooks. The iTunes library should not be deleted, because it is used by the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
PC users not able to update to Windows 10 can continue to use iTunes, but the new standalone apps offer a much more modern and simple-to-use experience that closer mirrors Mac interfaces.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-splits-itunes-for-windows/">Apple Officially Splits iTunes for Windows Into Apple Music, TV, and Devices Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-officially-splits-itunes-for-windows-into-apple-music-tv-and-devices-apps.2418812/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4 introduces some of the features in the iOS 17.4 beta, such as new emoji characters.

Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
The iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 betas introduce a whole slew of changes for users in the European Union, allowing for alternative app stores and alternative payment methods.<br/>
<br/>
There are new options for choosing a default browser, NFC has been opened up to banks and other financial institutions, and browsers aren't mandated to use WebKit.<br/>
<br/>
Along with these changes, the update also brings new emoji characters, Podcast transcripts, tweaks to Safari, hints of what we can expect from the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[As part of its compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) legislation, WhatsApp is putting the final touches to introducing platform interoperability with other encrypted messaging apps. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
In September, EU lawmakers designated WhatsApp parent company Meta as one of six so-called "gatekeepers," along with Google, Amazon, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">Apple</a>, ByteDance, and Microsoft, giving them six months to begin opening up their core platform services to others.<br/>
<br/>
The DMA comes into full effect in March 2024. That leaves just a few weeks for WhatsApp and others to bring their services into compliance. However, <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-interoperability-messaging/">Wired</a></em> reports that WhatsApp has actually been working on interoperability for the past two years, and its work is only partially motivated by the looming DMA.<br/>
<br/>
According to Dick Brouwer, an engineering director at WhatsApp, interoperability will initially focus on (non-SMS) text messaging, sending images, voice messages, videos, and files between two people. Calls and group chats will come in the next few years, as per the EU's rules.  <br/>
<br/>
Brouwer says users who opt-in to interoperability will see messages from other apps in a separate section at the top of their WhatsApp inbox. "The early thinking here is to put a separate inbox, given that these networks are very different," Brouwer says. "We cannot offer the same level of privacy and security," he told <em>Wired</em>. <br/>
<br/>
To send messages, third-party apps will need to encrypt content using the Signal Protocol, and then be packaged using XML, in compliance with the platform's existing client-server architecture. Apps will also need to connect to WhatsApp's servers to receive messages.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp will also allow other apps to use different encryption protocols if they can demonstrate they reach the security standards that WhatsApp outlines in its guidance. Third-party developers will also have an option to use a proxy between their apps and WhatsApp's servers. This could give developers more flexibility by removing the need for them to use WhatsApp's client-server protocols, but it also increases potential attack vectors, cautions Brouwer.<br/>
<br/>
Third-party chats appearing in WhatsApp could yet be some way off, however. Brouwer says the company is still working on the interoperability features and the level of support it will make available for companies wanting to integrate with it. Messaging companies that want to interoperate with WhatsApp will need to sign an agreement with the company and follow its terms. "Nobody quite knows how this works," Brouwer told <em>Wired</em>. "We have no idea what the demand is."<br/>
<br/>
The full details of the plan, which will apply to both WhatsApp and Messenger, will be published by Meta in March, and the company will have several months to implement it.<br/>
<br/>
"There's real tension between offering an easy way to offer this interoperability to third parties whilst at the same time preserving the WhatsApp privacy, security, and integrity bar," Brouwer admitted. "I think we're pretty happy with where we've landed," he added.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/">Encryption</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/whatsapp-interoperability-other-messaging-apps/">WhatsApp Working on Interoperability With Other Encrypted Messaging Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-working-on-interoperability-with-other-encrypted-messaging-apps.2418794/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
