		<description><![CDATA[As Apple's iPhone 16 launch approaches, questions are swirling about a potential leap in storage capacity for the iPhone 16 Pro models. According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">January report</a>, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will double their maximum storage to 2TB.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Right-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928697" /><br/>
This speculation stems from Apple's rumored adoption of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/1tb-iphone-16-pro-could-face-performance-setback/">Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash memory</a>. QLC technology could allow Apple to pack more storage into a smaller space while potentially reducing costs compared to the current Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND.<br/>
<br/>
However, it's crucial to approach these rumors with caution. Similar claims about 2TB options surfaced for both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/01/iphone-14-to-feature-2tb-storage/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/iphone-15-pro-2tb-storage-option/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, which ultimately proved false. Yet despite this history, there are new factors that lend credibility to the latest 2TB rumors.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro models are reportedly set to receive significant camera upgrades that could justify the need for increased storage. Rumors suggest an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">improved ultra-wide camera with a 48-megapixel sensor</a>, featuring the same pixel-binning technology as the main camera. This upgrade, combined with a wider f/2.2 aperture, promises substantially better low-light performance and support for 48-megapixel ProRaw photography. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is also said to be introducing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/iphone-16-lineup-wave-of-camera-improvements/">new image format</a> called "JPEG-XL." This addition to the existing lineup of HEIF, JPEG, HEIF Max, ProRaw, and ProRAW Max formats could potentially result in larger file sizes, making increased storage more necessary. The rumored capability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/iphone-16-lineup-wave-of-camera-improvements/">shoot 3K video at 120 frames per second with Dolby Vision</a> on the Pro models would also generate significantly larger files.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, Apple is reportedly planning to introduce a dedicated "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/iphone-16-capture-button-features/">Capture Button</a>" for the iPhone 16 Pro models, emphasizing the device's role as a serious photography and video capture device. Taken together, this collective push towards professional-grade image and video capabilities could justify the need for increased storage options.<br/>
<br/>
While the prospect of a 2TB iPhone is exciting, especially for content creators and power users, it's important to bear in mind that QLC NAND does have drawbacks. Most notably, it typically offers slower read and write speeds compared to TLC NAND.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/iphone-16-launch-month-is-here-everything-we-know/">iPhone 16 Launch Month Is Here: Everything We Know</a></li></ul><br/>
As we await official announcements from Apple during its upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">"It's Glowtime" event on September 9</a>, the possibility of a 2TB iPhone 16 Pro Max remains an intriguing, if uncertain, prospect. Whether this will be the year Apple finally breaks the storage barrier remains to be seen, but the combination of new hardware features and evolving storage technology certainly makes it a possibility. And if it doesn't happen, there's always hope for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/10-reasons-to-wait-iphone-17/">next year</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/04/will-iphone-16-pro-max-get-a-2tb-storage-option/">New iPhone 16 Pro 2TB Storage Option: All the Rumors In Favor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-16-pro-2tb-storage-option-all-the-rumors-in-favor.2435045/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bitmo Lab today <a href="https://www.bitmolab.com/pages/gamebaby">introduced the GameBaby</a>, a case that's perfect for playing retro games on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The GameBaby is a clever two-part accessory that adds a d-pad and buttons to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for gaming, and works as a protective case for day-to-day use.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/gamebaby-1.jpg" alt="" width="1776" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963507" /><br/>
The lower part of the case can be detached from the upper part and placed on the front of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, providing a physical interface that's ideal for retro games that have recently been made available on iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/">through emulators like Delta</a>. When you're not gaming, it pops off and can be attached to the back of the phone, for protection with added gaming functionality.<br/>
<br/>
The case does not have power and does not connect to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in any way, which suggests they are capacitive and designed to activate on-screen buttons. According to Bitmo Lab, the case is compatible with Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advanced and NES button layouts, with custom emulator skins that offer "perfect compatibility" across different handheld console layouts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/gamebaby-2.jpg" alt="" width="1999" height="1264" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963508" /><br/>
The GameBaby has specifically been designed to work with the layouts made available through the Delta emulator. It will be available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max.<br/>
<br/>
The GameBaby <a href="https://www.bitmolab.com/products/gamebaby">can be pre-ordered for &#36;20</a> for the first 1,000 units, with the pre-order price going up to &#36;25 after that.

		<description><![CDATA[Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/core-ultra-200v-series-mobile.html">today unveiled</a> its new "Lunar Lake" Intel Core Ultra 200V processors, designed for thin and light AI PCs. Intel's new chips are meant to compete with Apple silicon chips and the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips that Microsoft recently adopted for its AI-focused Copilot+ PCs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Intel Core Ultra Launch Event (Replay)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LVI7DTjp6NQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
According to Intel, the Lunar Lake chips are its most efficient x86 processors ever, built "without compromise." Intel claims that the p-core in the Lunar Lake chip is the "fastest CPU core of any processor in a thin and light laptop," and that its Xe2 graphics architecture is the "fastest built-in GPU in the industry."<br/>
<br/>
Intel says that it tested almost 50 games and the Lunar Lake chips were 16 percent faster than AMD chips and 68 percent faster than Qualcomm chips. The chip has four p-cores (power) and four e-cores (efficiency), similar to the Apple silicon chips, and memory is no longer separate.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/intel-core-ultra.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963515" /><br/>
Intel didn't compare its new chips to Apple silicon chips, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite's CPU performance is not too far off from the M4 chip, so the Lunar Lake chips could be faster. Memory maxes out at 32GB though, so Intel doesn't have chips able to compete with the Pro and Max Apple silicon chips.<br/>
<br/>
Intel says that compared to Qualcomm's chips, Lunar Lake offers a 20 percent improvement in performance per watt, with the chip drawing up to 40 percent less power than its predecessor. Intel says that consumers can expect several more hours of battery life, along with significant gains in performance, graphics, and AI.<br/>
<br/>
Devices with Intel's latest chips are set to be available starting on September 24.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/">Intel</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/intel-lunar-lake-chip-improvements/">Intel Says New Lunar Lake Chips Have &#039;Fastest Built-In GPU in the Industry&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/intel-says-new-lunar-lake-chips-have-fastest-built-in-gpu-in-the-industry.2435029/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-ai-windows-pcs/">new Copilot+ PCs</a> that offer super fast performance for AI tasks, all-day battery life, and other perks, struggle when it comes to gaming, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-rolled-out-ai-pcs-that-cant-play-top-gamesand-theres-no-quick-fix-0a1b6376">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/microsoft-copilot-plus-pc.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953308" /><br/>
The Copilot+ PCs are equipped with Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon chips that merge the CPU, GPU, and a Neural Processing Unit. Using an Arm chip means Microsoft's PCs now face the some of the same problems as Apple's Macs, such as an inability to run popular PC games designed for x86 chip architecture. Approximately 15 percent of PC laptop users are gamers, and Microsoft users aren't accustomed to having to deal with incompatibilities. <br/>
<br/>
To get around the Arm issue, Microsoft designed Prism, which is basically the equivalent of Rosetta 2 on Apple Macs. It makes it so x86 apps can run on Arm-based Windows machines, but it turns out it's not working well. In a test of 1,300 PC games, only half of them ran without bugs, glitches, or launch issues.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases, anti-cheating software in games like Fortnite and League of Legends can't be translated to run on Arm, preventing even games without significant graphics requirements from running. There is no quick fix for the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Reviews of the Copilot+ PCs highlighted problems with Prism way back in June. <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186432/microsoft-windows-on-arm-qualcomm-copilot-plus-pcs-prism-emulator">The Verge</a></em>, for example, said that Premiere Pro was "practically unusable" and that rendering projects in Blender was "terrible." Shadows of the Tomb Raider crashed continually, and other titles like Destiny 2, Starfield, Halo Infinite, and Fall Guys would not launch.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft told <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> that titles with demanding graphics requirements may not play on Copilot+ PCs, and that while it is aiming to make a "quality gaming experience" on the new devices, players who want a high-performance experience should choose an alternate PC.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/microsoft-ai-pcs-game-issues/">Microsoft&#039;s New AI Computers Struggle With Hundreds of Popular PC Games</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsofts-new-ai-computers-struggle-with-hundreds-of-popular-pc-games.2435023/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Accessory maker Zens this week introduced the <a href="https://zens.tech/shop/quattro-charger-pro-4/">Quattro Charger Pro 4</a>, a multi-device charging station with a unique design. There are two rectangular charging platforms, each with a pair of magnetic charging surfaces for charging four total devices at one time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/zens-quattro-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1511" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963504" /><br/>
The Quattro is a Qi2 charger, so each of the magnetic charging pucks can charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at up to 15W. With Qi2 support and the multi-level design, the Quattro is able to charge four iPhones at once at 15W.<br/>
<br/>
Because the charger is flat, it works with both MagSafe-compatible iPhones and older Qi devices that do not have included magnets. The charging surface can also be used for AirPods and other smartphones, but it does not work with the Apple Watch. Given the orientation of the charger, it is worth noting that StandBy is not supported.<br/>
<br/>
The Quattro Charger Pro 4 can be <a href="https://zens.tech/shop/quattro-charger-pro-4/">pre-ordered from the Zens website</a> for &#36;200, with black and white color options available.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has allowed cloud gaming apps on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-allows-game-streaming-apps-on-app-store/">since earlier this year</a>, but cloud gaming services still haven't bothered making iOS apps. Microsoft recently explained why, telling UK regulators that it didn't bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; because the rules are still too restrictive.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/App-Store-and-XCloud.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-758525" /><br/>
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming">is investigating</a> mobile browsers and cloud gaming, and put out a call for comments. Microsoft responded in late July (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234777/microsoft-apple-cloud-gaming-app-store-changes-xbox-cma">The Verge</a></em>) and said [<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6d0d19084b18b95709f13/Microsoft_WP_6_Redacted_version_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED__1_.pdf">PDF</a>] that while cloud gaming apps are technically allowed, there are still multiple rules that cloud gaming apps can't comply with for "technical and economic reasons."<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft's chief complaint is that the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules require subscriptions and features to be made available on iOS devices with in-app purchase, which is "not feasible." A consumption-only situation where content is purchased on another platform and played on iOS is not allowed for cloud gaming apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's 30 percent commission fee "makes it impossible" for Microsoft to monetize its cloud gaming service, and it is neither "economically sustainable nor justifiable."<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft also complains about Apple's lack of support for alternative app stores and the limitations of web apps, such as an inability to access device hardware features.<br/>
<br/>
Google also submitted a separate document in the UK, and it simply suggests that regulators focus on the iOS &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rather than taking a look at Google Play.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6c53fc52d5fb4c82ddd66/2024-08-07_Apple_Response_to_Working_Paper_6_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED.pdf">own statement</a> said that it "supports and encourages" cloud gaming services on iOS, and that there are successful cloud gaming services <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/antstream-arcade/id1311611749">such as Antstream</a>. Apple suggested that regulators revisit their thinking following its support for cloud gaming, which did happen after the investigation launched.<br/>
<br/>
The UK will take Microsoft's comments and comments from other parties into account when making a decision in the ongoing mobile browser and cloud gaming investigation.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xbox/">Xbox</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/microsoft-cloud-gaming-ios-app-impossible/">Microsoft Says Apple&#039;s 30% Fee Makes Xbox Cloud Gaming iOS App &#039;Impossible&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-says-apples-30-fee-makes-xbox-cloud-gaming-ios-app-impossible.2435013/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Logitech subsidiary <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/33geA">Ultimate Ears</a> has been in the portable wireless speaker market for over a decade now, gradually building a full set of models across a range of sizes, power, and price points. The most recent addition to the lineup is the <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/B0jQZJ">EVERBOOM</a>, a mid-range speaker that debuted a few months ago. I've been testing one out and I've found it to be a handy and capable speaker in a variety of settings.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-parts.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963488" /><br/>
Priced at &#36;249.99, the EVERBOOM sits in the middle of the Ultimate Ears lineup, which currently ranges from the WONDERBOOM 4 at &#36;99.99 all the way up to the HYPERBOOM at &#36;399.99. Like many of Ultimate Ears' speakers, the EVERBOOM is designed for an active lifestyle, offering IP67 water and dust resistance to stand up to not just splashes but full dunks in water. The speaker even floats, and it's been drop tested from a height of one meter.<br/>
<br/>
The EVERBOOM is more or less an elliptic cylinder, measuring a little over 8 inches (200 mm) high, 4.3 inches (110 mm) wide, and 3.25 inches (85 mm) deep. Aside from plastic toward the top and bottom of the speaker, it is wrapped entirely in a speaker mesh, with Ultimate Ears touting 360-degree sound. In reality, the audio largely comes from the two sides of the speaker, but with them firing in opposite directions, you do indeed get pretty solid sound projection all around. The EVERBOOM includes a pair of full-range transducers paired with two customized passive radiators to help deliver full sound from the relatively small form factor.<br/>
<br/>
I found sound quality to be quite good, with the 360-degree sound easily filling even a fairly large room and remaining quite audible and well-balanced outdoors. It can get quite loud if you turn it up, although distortion becomes a bit of an issue as you start to max it out in more enclosed environments.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-front.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963489" /><br/>
Volume is easily controlled right from the speaker with the huge iconic plus and minus buttons on the front. They're a bold design decision, but they make an Ultimate Ears speaker pretty much instantly recognizable. Pressing both of them simultaneously while the speaker is powered on gives you a general sense of battery level with some lights hidden behind the mesh up at the top.<br/>
<br/>
An Outdoor Boost mode can be activated with a button on the speaker or from within the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ue-boom/id632344648">UE | BOOM app</a>, offering a bit more punch with the sound output optimized for outdoor spaces. The increase in bass is definitely noticeable when it's turned on.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the UE | BOOM app, it offers an array of functionality for managing one or more speakers from the Utimate Ears lineup. You can of course use the EVERBOOM as a standalone Bluetooth speaker right from the options on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or other device, but the app includes features like an equalizer, the ability to link multiple speakers, and more. With PARTYUP mode, you can sync up to 150 speakers from the UE lineup to maximize your sound. The app also offers convenient controls for changing tracks and volumes, turning the speaker on and off, activating Outdoor Boost, and activating a Microphone mode that lets you broadcast your voice over the speaker via your phone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-app-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1031" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963490" /><br/>
The equalizer panel offers five preset configurations: a flat Signature curve, a Bass Boost setting that does just what you'd expect, a Cramped Spaces option that drops the mids a bit, a Deep Relaxation mode that drops the treble way down, and a Podcast/Vocal setting that drops the bass. Any of these presets can be customized via five sliders spanning the various frequencies.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-app-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1031" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963491" /><br/>
Another handy aspect of the UE | BOOM app is management of the Magic Button, which is a function of the play/pause hardware button on the speaker itself. The play/pause button offers the usual functionality with a single press playing or pausing music, a double press skipping forward, and a triple press skipping backward. But there's also a fourth function, and that's a long press to activate the Magic Button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-app-3.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1031" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963492" /><br/>
In the app, you can configure the Magic Button to activate a playlist from either <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> or Amazon Music. It requires connecting the UE | BOOM app to those services, at which point you'll be able to see all of your saved playlists and select up to four of them to link to the Magic Button. A long press on the button on the speaker immediately starts the first playlist you've configured, and subsequent long presses will cycle through your selected playlists.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the app only gets middling reviews from users, with some citing Bluetooth connection problems and ads covering important controls, but I haven't experienced any of those issues in my testing, so hopefully they've been resolved.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-top.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="948" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963493" /><br/>
Beneath the buttons on the top of the EVERBOOM is an NFC chip that allows for quick pairing and switching with Android devices. It doesn't currently work with iOS devices, but perhaps it will at some point in the future as Apple gradually opens up the NFC capabilities of its devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963494" /><br/>
The EVERBOOM offers up to 20 hours of battery life and a Bluetooth range of up to 55 meters (180 feet), offering solid flexibility while on the go. A small loop on the back of the speaker and an included carabiner make it easy to hang the EVERBOOM from a backpack, tent, or other convenient spot. It recharges over USB-C, with the device's port located at the bottom rear behind a flap that helps prevent water intrusion.<br/>
<br/>
The EVERBOOM is available now for &#36;249.99 from <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/B0jQZJ">Ultimate Ears</a> and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUltimate-Ears-EVERBOOM-Charcoal-Black%2Fdp%2FB0BYC52LYP">Amazon</a> in Azure Blue or Charcoal Black. Lilac and Raspberry color options are currently sold out. Alongside the EVERBOOM launch in June, Ultimate Ears also refreshed its <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/21O3xA">WONDERBOOM</a>, <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/3e23Dn">BOOM</a>, and <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/vNXrRL">MEGABOOM</a> speakers with USB-C ports and new colors in 100% post-consumer recycled fabric. The BOOM and MEGABOOM also received enhanced deep bass radiators while the WONDERBOOM added an audio mode optimized for podcasts.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[There are a number of ways that Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Microsoft are failing to comply with the Digital Markets Act, according to <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-062_Summary-non-compliance-reports-gatekeepers.pdf">an analysis published</a> by the European Consumer Organization (BEUC). The BEUC advocates for consumer rights and provides guidance to European lawmakers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
In regard to Apple, the BEUC outlines several ways that the company's DMA compliance efforts fall short, but it is worth noting that Apple has addressed many of these issues in its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/app-store-external-links-european-union/">most recent DMA updates</a>, which will be implemented starting later in 2024. <br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Apple creates unnecessary steps to impede or deter users from switching to alternative app stores or downloading apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple does not make it easy for consumers to change their default settings.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple's browser choice screen does not provide enough information for consumers to make an effective choice, and the choice screen is "confusing, complex and creates negative friction."</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple uses non-neutral language to scare consumers away from choosing alternative payment services or subscribing to cheaper services outside of an app. This is in reference to the disclosure screens that Apple presents when consumers use alternative payments.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple does not allow end users to easily uninstall first-party apps, and while Safari can be deleted by the end of 2024, Apple was required to allow that feature by March.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple does not provide adequate compliance reports to the European Commission, and has delayed the implementation of some of its DMA measures, a "blatant violation" of the DMA.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Many of the DMA changes that Apple announced last month make the report outdated, and the BEUC does acknowledge that Apple plans to implement tweaks to its DMA compliance. The BEUC says that the "precise details" of Apple's changes "will need to be evaluated." The report is clearly of the opinion, however, that Apple is taking too long to implement these features. Most of the updates will be made before the end of the year, while some others won't be enabled until spring 2025. Here's what Apple changed to better comply with the DMA:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>New default apps will be able to be set for phone calls, messaging, password managers, keyboards, navigation, translation, and call spam filters.</li><br/>
 	<li>There is a new Default Apps section in the Settings app, which specifically addresses one of the complaints in the BEUC's report. It was confusing to consumers to have to go to the "Safari" settings to manage a non-Safari default browser.</li><br/>
 	<li>Safari, &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, Messages, Camera, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> apps will be able to be deleted.</li><br/>
 	<li>The browser selection screen shown to consumers at setup will include a description about the browser, an option to set a default right from the screen, and a requirement to scroll all the way down before choosing a browser.</li><br/>
 	<li>When a default browser that is not Safari is selected, that browser's icon will replace Safari's icon on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or Dock.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
For other tech companies, the BEUC targeted Meta's cross-service ads and messaging interoperability, Google's self-preferencing in search results and personal data use across services, Amazon's self-preferencing and difficulty unsubscribing from services, TikTok's personal data consent implementation, and Microsoft's customer consent screen for the use of data across services.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission will likely take the recommendations from the BEUC into account when taking further action on the way tech companies are complying with the Digital Markets Act. The report says that it is not an exhaustive assessment of compliance with every provision of the DMA, and is instead focused on issues relevant to consumers. Apple's fees for developers, for example, would not fall under the scope of the report, so the company could also face changes to its DMA compliance in areas not mentioned here.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/eu-apple-dma-non-compliance-report/">EU Consumer Group Summarizes How Apple Fails to Comply With DMA</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-consumer-group-summarizes-how-apple-fails-to-comply-with-dma.2435003/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the ninth beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> update to developers, with the beta coming a week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-8/">after the eighth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; is able to take the depth information from 2D photos and turn them into 3D photos using advanced machine learning. Apple says that the feature is meant to add depth to photos to make memories more immersive.<br/>
<br/>
There are new hand gestures for activating the Home View and Control Center, and the Home View is also now customizable with apps able to be rearranged. Travel Mode now includes support for trains, and Guest User profiles are now saved for 30 days so guests don't have to do the setup process every time they try out the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the year, Mac Virtual Display will support higher resolution and larger sized virtual displays, which Apple says will be equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. With an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> update, the Vision Pro can serve as an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; receiver, so content from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac can be shared to the headset.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Huawei has announced a September 10 event where the Chinese company plans to unveil the world's first tri-folding smartphone, with the timing of the event an apparently deliberate attempt to upstage Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 reveal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/huawei-trifold-event.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963407" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Huawei teaser showing tri-fold shape</em></div><br/>
Huawei hasn't yet officially shown off the pocketable phone, which reportedly has a 10-inch display when completely unfolded, but the company has shared a teaser on Weibo that depicts a device with three folding sides in a sort of reverse Z-shape, leaving little to the imagination about what's headlining the event. <br/>
<br/>
Concepts of a three-fold device have not been in short supply over the years, but Huawei clearly thinks it can bring one to market, although DSCC analyst Ross Young has <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1830469588108386780">suggested</a> that it will be the most expensive smartphone yet. The company's consumer and automotive technology executive Richard Yu called it an "epoch-making product."<br/>
<br/>
The Huawei event is scheduled for September 10 at 2:30 p.m. China Standard Time. That translates to 11.30 p.m. Pacific Time on September 9, so the same day of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">"It's Glowtime" event</a> for observers on the US West Coast. Apart from the foldable, new smartwatches and an electric car are also expected to be announced by Huawei on stage.<br/>
<br/>
Huawei's recent resurgence has significantly challenged Apple's position in the Chinese smartphone market. According to research firm <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q2-2024">Canalys</a>, Apple's standing in China has notably declined, with the company falling out of the top five smartphone vendors by market share in the second quarter of 2023. <br/>
<br/>
In stark contrast, Huawei has experienced a remarkable upswing during the same period. The company saw its smartphone shipments in China surge by 41% compared to the same quarter last year, marking the fastest growth rate among the top five brands in the country. <br/>

Apple is unlikely to release a foldable iPhone before 2027, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/foldable-iphone-unlikely-to-launch-before-2027/">Taiwanese research firm TrendForce</a>. Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/first-apple-foldable-coming-in-2025/">widely expected</a> to release a large-screen foldable iPad or MacBook to kick-off its foray into the product category‌.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/huawei/">Huawei</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/huawei-upstage-apple-iphone-16-tri-fold/">Huawei Aims to Upstage Sep 9 Apple Event With Tri-Fold Phone Debut</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/huawei-aims-to-upstage-sep-9-apple-event-with-tri-fold-phone-debut.2434984/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expected to launch a fourth-generation iPhone SE early next year with an OLED display for the first time, marking the completion of Apple's adoption of OLED technology across all iPhone models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Japan-no-longer-iPhone-display-supplier-as-Apple-ends-LCD-use">Nikkei Asia</a></em>, the move away from LCD displays will exclude two longstanding Japanese panel makers, Japan Display (JDI) and Sharp, from Apple's iPhone supply chain. <br/>
<br/>
In 2017, Apple introduced OLED screens with the iPhone X. Since then, OLED displays have replaced LCD screens in Apple's high-end iPhone models. This shift has significantly impacted LCD suppliers. In 2015, JDI and Sharp provided about 200 million LCD panels yearly for iPhones. <br/>
<br/>
However, by 2023, this number had decreased dramatically to around 20 million. Recently, Apple's gradual adoption of OLED has seen both Japanese LCD makers supply for just iPhone SE models.<br/>
<br/>
JDI currently only supplies small OLED displays for devices such as the Apple Watch. JDI is now focusing on revamping its business strategy around LCDs for automotive applications, while Sharp is scaling back its LCD business, which was primarily for TVs.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Apple has reportedly begun placing orders for OLED displays for the upcoming iPhone SE from China's BOE Technology Group and South Korea's LG Display.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature an iPhone 14-like design, Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, an Action button, an Apple-designed 5G modem, an A18 processor, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. The device's display is expected to grow in size from 4.7 inches to 6.06 inches, and internal RAM is likely to be 8GB, up from 4GB in the 2022 model, due to the hardware requirements of Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Apple suppliers are expected to begin ramping up mass production of the device in October of this year. The device could be released ahead of the Lunar New Year in January 2025. However, all three existing iPhone SE models were announced in March over the years, so a March 2025 release seems possible too.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/">Nikkei</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/iphone-se-4-complete-apple-switch-oled/">iPhone SE 4 to Complete Apple&#039;s Switch to OLED Across iPhone Lineup</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-to-complete-apples-switch-to-oled-across-iphone-lineup.2434977/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> is set to succeed 2023's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, introducing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">over 30 new features</a> and improvements to Apple's high-end smartphones. With many users adopting two-year upgrade cycles, plenty of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro owners will be looking to upgrade to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;, so this guide breaks down every major difference you should be aware of between the two generations based on rumors. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-14-Pro-vs-16-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937778" /></div><br/>
In 2022, Apple unveiled the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro as the successor to the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro, introducing an always-on display, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a 48-megapixel camera, the A16 Bionic chip, longer battery life, and more. Two years later, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to offer at least 60 upgrades. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are rumored to feature compared to their 2022 predecessor are listed below, using information from reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">previously covered</a> here on <em>MacRumors</em>. We will continue to update this article as more rumors emerge prior to Apple's "It's glowtime" event on Monday, September 9.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
The design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to be a relatively significant evolution over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro, iterating on the titanium frame and slightly rounded edges introduced on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models last year. <br/>
<br/>

<h3 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h3><br/>
To accommodate larger displays, both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are rumored to grow in height and width. In addition to last year's increase in depth, the devices are due to be considerably larger, but with a notable reduction in weight thanks to the adoption of a titanium frame. <br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro in 2023, introducing a titanium chassis, slimmer bezels, the Action button, and a USB-C port. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; will build on these upgrades, offering larger displays, the Capture button, and improved cameras. With at least 60 upgrades likely to be in store, many &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro users will find upgrading to an &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; model worthwhile.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 60 Upgrades to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro-60-upgrades-to-expect.2420302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
Amazon has the AirPods Max for &#36;399.00 in every color this week, down from &#36;549.00. This is nearly a match of the all-time low price on the headphones, just &#36;5 higher than that Prime Day deal we saw in July.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new low-end Magic Keyboard accessory for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-01/apple-s-succession-strategy-m4-mac-mini-cheaper-ipad-magic-keyboard-m0jkdrx5">Mark Gurman reports</a>.<br/>

In the latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-01/apple-s-succession-strategy-m4-mac-mini-cheaper-ipad-magic-keyboard-m0jkdrx5">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman said that Apple's suppliers are developing a new keyboard for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that is scheduled to launch next year. The accessory is said to be designed for the entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, rather than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. While it will lack an aluminum top case like the new Magic Keyboard for the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, it may feature a function row. It should be released by the middle of 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Apple debuted a completely redesigned Magic Keyboard for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, featuring an aluminum top case, a function row, and a larger trackpad. Apple continues to sell the previous generation Magic Keyboard for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, as well as the Magic Keyboard Folio for the 10th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/">Magic Keyboard</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/apple-working-on-redesigned-ipad-magic-keyboard/">Apple Working on Redesigned Magic Keyboard for iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-redesigned-magic-keyboard-for-ipad.2434869/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> will not have any USB-A ports, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-01/apple-s-succession-strategy-m4-mac-mini-cheaper-ipad-magic-keyboard-m0jkdrx5">Mark Gurman reports</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Black-Ortho-Warmer.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961272" /><br/>
The current &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip features two USB-C ports and two USB-A ports, while the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro variant has four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-01/apple-s-succession-strategy-m4-mac-mini-cheaper-ipad-magic-keyboard-m0jkdrx5">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman explained that the new &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; with the M4 Pro chip will have a total of five USB-C ports, but no USB-A ports. Three USB-C ports will be located on the back, while two will be present on the front of the machine, similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>. There will continue to be ports for ethernet, HDMI, and 3.5mm audio. The power supply will apparently continue to be internal.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, Gurman reported that the next-generation &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; with the M4 and M4 Pro chips will feature the first major design change to the machine since 2010. The new &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; will apparently approach the size of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, but it may be slightly taller than the current model, which is 1.4 inches high. It will continue to feature an aluminum shell. Individuals working on the new device apparently say that it is "essentially an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> in a small box."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says that suppliers in China are scheduled to begin shipping the new &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; models with the M4 chip in early September. The M4 Pro model will not begin shipping until October. The M4 generation of Apple silicon will purportedly be the first time that Apple has used the same chip generation across all of its Macs, with refreshes to add the M4 chip to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> planned to take place over the next year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">announced</a> that on Monday, September 9 it will hold its annual fall event, which means we are just days away from the launch of the iPhone 16. Like the iPhone 15 series, this year's lineup is expected to stick with four models – iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max – although there are plenty of design differences and new features to take into account.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Pro-Mock-Article.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924441" /><br/>
To bring you up to speed ahead of Apple's "It's Glowtime" event, we've summarized below the biggest iPhone 16 rumors we've covered so far here on <em>MacRumors</em>. For more details, follow the links, or dive into our dedicated roundups for both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    1. Larger Displays</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Biggest Ever iPhones</span><br><br/>
This year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to be getting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">bigger display sizes</a>, increasing to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The new display sizes would be the largest ever for the iPhone.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    2. Vertical Camera Layout</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 16 base models will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">vertical camera arrangement</a> with a pill-shaped raised surface, instead of a diagonal camera arrangement like the iPhone 15. The new camera bump features two separate camera rings for the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras. The vertical camera layout is expected to enable Spatial Video recording, which is currently limited to the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
3. Battery Changes</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 16 Models</span><br><br/>
Rumors suggest the ‌iPhone 16‌ and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">larger batteries</a> than their predecessors, although the smaller iPhone 16 Pro device could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-16-pro-battery-capacities/">see the biggest improvement</a>, while the ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus may have reduced capacity. The iPhone 16 is said to have a 6% increase over the iPhone 15, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max gaining a 5% increase, and the iPhone 16 Pro seeing a 9% increase. In contrast, the iPhone 16 Plus is rumored to have a 9% reduction in capacity. On the other hand, Apple could also potentially use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/iphone-15-hybrid-lens-rumor/">stacked battery technology</a> to increase energy density and prolong lifespan across the lineup. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
4. Capture Button</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">New Camera Capabilities</span><br><br/>
All iPhone 16 models will have a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">Capture Button</a>" dedicated to triggering image or video capture. The button will add features like the ability to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus on a subject with a light press, and activate a recording with a more forceful press. The Capture Button will be located on the bottom right side of the ‌iPhone 16, and will take the place of the mmWave antenna on U.S. ‌iPhone‌ models, with the antenna relocating to the left side of the device below the volume and Action buttons.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
5. Ultra Wide Lens Upgrade</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to feature an upgraded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera lens</a>, which should allow it to capture more light, resulting in improved photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments. This also means that iPhone 16 Pro models should be able to shoot 48-megapixel ProRAW photos in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/iphone-16-pro-dual-48mp-cameras/">rumored</a> to boast a bigger main camera thanks to an advanced custom 48-megapixel Sony IMX903 sensor.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
6. Super Telephoto Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro Max could be the first to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/iphone-16-pro-max-super-telephoto-camera/">super telephoto periscope camera</a> for dramatically increased optical zoom. "Super" or "ultra" telephoto usually describes cameras with a focal length of over 300mm. The current telephoto lens is equivalent to a 77mm lens, so if accurate, there could be a notable increase in zoom capabilities. Super telephoto cameras are often used for sports and wild animal photography, but the extremely soft backgrounds they create also make them useful for portrait photography, providing there is enough distance between the subject and the photographer.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
7. Faster Wi-Fi Support</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Wi-Fi 6E & Wi-Fi 7</span><br><br/>
Apple's 2024 iPhone Pro models are expected to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">Wi-Fi 7 in the Pro models</a>, enabling data transfer over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously. This should result in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. With technologies such as 4K QAM, Wi-Fi 7 is  also expected to offer peak data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">rumored to support Wi-Fi 6E</a>, which works with the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
8. New A18 Series Chips</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 16 Models</span><br><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">next-generation A18 Pro chip</a> is expected to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E. All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to rumors, but Apple could still differentiate between the standard models and the Pro models, even giving the chips separate A18 and A18 Pro names. It makes sense for all four ‌iPhone 16‌ models to have the same A18 chip because of the Apple Intelligence features set to debut in iOS 18. Apple Intelligence requires a high-powered chip for the AI features to run on-device. At this time, only the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and Pro Max are able to use Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
9. 5G Qualcomm Modem</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple is expected to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-5g-advanced-rumor/">Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X75 modem</a> in this year's Pro and Pro Max models. The Snapdragon X75 includes improved carrier aggregation and other technology advancements for faster 5G download and upload speeds compared to the X70, which is used in iPhone 15 models. The modem's combined mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G transceiver also takes up 25% less circuit board space, and is said to use up to 20% less power. The standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to retain the Snapdragon X70 modem.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
10. Tetraprism Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro</span><br><br/>
Both iPhone 16 Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">expected to feature 5x optical zoom</a>, which is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple's tetraprism lens system has a "folded" design that allows it to fit inside the smartphone, enabling up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom. In contrast, the current smaller iPhone 15 Pro is limited to up to 3x optical zoom, which is in line with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
11. Micro-Lens Technology</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">More Efficient OLED</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be weighing up the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/iphone-16-oled-displays-micro-lens-efficiency/">use of micro-lens technology</a> to maintain or increase the brightness of OLED displays on next year's iPhone 16 models while potentially reducing their power consumption. MLA works by using a uniform pattern of billions of lenses inside the panel that reduces internal reflections. These lenses turn the path of light reflected backwards from the inside of the panel towards the screen, which can serve either to increase perceived brightness while maintaining the same level of power consumption, or maintain brightness levels while consuming less power compared to conventional OLED panels at the same luminance.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
12. Action Button</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro models include an Action Button, and in 2024, the Action Button is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">expanded to the standard iPhone 16 models</a>. The Action Button used across the iPhone 16 lineup will be identical to the iPhone 15 Pro Action Button. The Action button, which replaces the traditional mute switch, can perform multiple functions such as activating the Flashlight, turning on the Camera, launching a Shortcut, enabling or disabling a Focus mode, using Translate, turning on/off Silent Mode, and more.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
13. 40W Fast Charging and 20W MagSafe</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will support 40W wired fast charging and 20W MagSafe charging, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/iphone-16-pro-40w-fast-charging-20w-magsafe/">recurring rumor</a>. Right now, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models are capable of up to 27W peak charging speeds with an appropriate USB-C power adapter, while official MagSafe chargers from Apple and authorized third parties can wirelessly charge the iPhone 15 models at up to 15W. The charging boost is expected to balance and improve the problem of increasing charging time caused by the increase in battery capacity. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
14. Upgraded Microphone</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Enhanced Siri</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">significant upgrade</a> to the iPhone 16 microphone to improve the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/">Apple Intelligence-enhanced Siri experience</a>, which will include contextual awareness, semantic indexing, app control, and on-screen awareness. Apple's Siri AI ambitions will heavily rely on improved voice input processing, and the new mic is expected to offer significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
15. New Thermal Design</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Reduced Heat</span><br><br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">graphene thermal system</a> for the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup, while the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models could add metal battery casings to reduce overheating. Graphene has high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper, which is currently used in iPhone heat-sinks. Another source has claimed that iPhone 16 models will be equipped with a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/internal-change-to-iphone-16-models-expected-to-reduce-overheating/">larger graphite sheet</a>" inside the chassis of the devices, to address potential overheating. The move could be in response to widely encountered overheating issues experienced with the iPhone 15 Pro, which Apple addressed through a software update.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
16. Expanded Storage</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available with double the maximum storage capacity as the iPhone 15 Pro models, increasing from 1TB to 2TB, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">according to one rumor</a>. The move is said to be a result of Apple's switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash for higher storage models. Apple's use of QLC NAND could allow Apple to fit more storage into a smaller space and it is less expensive than Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND, which current iPhones use. On the downside, QLC has comparatively slower read and write speeds.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
17. Increased Memory</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models have been rumored to both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">feature 8GB of RAM</a>, an increase over the 6GB of RAM in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. More working memory should equate to improved performance for multitasking on the iPhone. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/apple-iphone-15-pro-requirement-apple-intelligence/">hinted</a> that plenty of RAM is required for Apple Intelligence features, so it is perhaps no coincidence that all devices in the iPhone 16 lineup will have at least 8GB of RAM.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
18. Upgraded Neural Engine</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Enhanced Machine Learning</span><br><br/>
Apple's next-generation A18 chips will feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">upgraded Neural Engine</a> with "significantly" more cores, according to one Taiwanese report. An upgraded Neural Engine should improve the performance of Apple Intelligence features and machine learning tasks. Apple's iPhone 12 through iPhone 15 models all include a 16-core Neural Engine. Despite no difference in core counts across generations, Apple has still managed to improve their performance in successive models.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
19. Ultra-Thin Bezel Technology</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Maximized Display Size</span><br><br/>
Apple plans to maximize the display size on the iPhone 16 series by using a new ultra-thin bezel technology, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/">according to one rumor</a>. Apple will use Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology to minimize the bezel at the bottom of the display. BRS achieves this by rolling up the internal copper wiring into a more compact package. Apple reportedly plans to apply the borderless display technology to all four iPhone 16 models, but the Pro models will have the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/iphone-16-pro-thinnest-bezels-smartphone/">thinnest bezels of any smartphone</a>, beating the screen border thinness of even its latest iPhone 15 Pro devices.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
20. New Polished Titanium Finish</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple will use an improved finishing process for the titanium chassis on the iPhone 16 Pro models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/">according to one rumor</a>. The new process will allegedly make the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max look more polished than the iPhone 15 Pro models, which have a brushed finish. The improved manufacturing process will result in a glossy appearance that is more akin to the heavily polished stainless steel material used in previous Pro iPhones. However, the new titanium finish will be less prone to scratches compared to stainless steel.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
21. Reduced Lens Flare</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Less Photo Artifacts</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/iphone-16-pro-camera-reduced-lens-flare/">testing</a> a new anti-reflective optical coating technology for its iPhone cameras that could improve the quality of photos by reducing artifacts like lens flare and ghosting. Apple plans to bring new atomic layer deposition (ALD) equipment into the iPhone camera lens manufacturing process to apply the coating. ALD-applied materials can also protect against environmental damage to the camera lens system without affecting the sensor's ability to capture light effectively.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
22. New Colors</span><br><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will likely announce new Mac models with M4-series chips in November, confidential information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> claims.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Logo-Spotlight.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912758" /><br/>
According to a reliable source familiar with the matter, Apple will release new Mac models in November 2024. While new Macs are usually released toward the end of the year, this is the first time a launch month has been singled out for the upcoming M4 Macs.<br/>
<br/>
This does not discount the possibility of Apple holding an event in October to announce the new machines. Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">announced</a> its "Scary Fast" event on Tuesday, October 23. It hosted the event on Monday, October 30, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">unveiling</a> new MacBook Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> models with M3 chips. These new machines then launched on Tuesday, November 7, so we could see a similar series of events this year.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple has plans to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/these-new-macs-are-coming-in-2024/">four new Mac models with M4-series chips before the end of the year</a>: an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip, new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, a new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with the M4 chip, and a completely <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/">redesigned Mac mini</a> with the M4 and M4 Pro chips. With the exception of the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, these devices are expected to be minor refreshes that focus on chip upgrades, but they could come with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/">16GB of memory as standard</a> across the board for the first time. Some of these machines are now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/macbook-pro-m4-pro-m4-max-production-report/">believed to be in mass production</a>, which may line up with a November release date.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-imac/">M4 iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/apple-likely-to-launch-m4-macs-in-november/">Apple Likely to Launch M4 Macs in November</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-launch-m4-macs-in-november.2434864/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's annual fall event takes place on Monday, September 9, when it is expected to unveil the new iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lineup, and some new Apple Watch models. It may also make some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/30/apple-september-2024-event-new-products-expected/">additional new products available</a>, but there are a handful of rumored upcoming devices that we don't expect to make an appearance this month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Glowtime-What-Not-To-Expect-Feature-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963275" /><br/>
To help set expectations ahead of Apple's "It's Glowtime" event, we've compiled a list of products that Apple is unlikely to announce in September, but rather later on in the year or in 2025 and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M4-Powered Macs</h2><br/>
Apple is developing new Macs powered by the company's next-generation M4 chip, which is built on chipmaking partner TSMC's second-generation 3nm technology and features a new display engine, resulting in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/m4-ipad-pro-cpu-benchmark/">significant performance and power efficiency improvements</a> over the M3 chip that Apple's most recent Mac models are based on.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Black-Ortho-Warmer.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961272" /><br/>
The first of Apple's new M4-powered Macs are expected to arrive later in the year. According to <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman's sources, Apple is planning to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/apple-testing-four-m4-macs/">refresh</a> the MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac with M4 chips this year, and we are likely to see the new models announced sometime in October, with a possible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/apple-likely-to-launch-m4-macs-in-november/">November launch</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Four machines that Apple has been testing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-23/when-is-apple-announcing-the-iphone-16-apple-planning-event-on-sept-10-2024">reportedly</a> have base-level M4 chips, according to developer logs. Three of the Macs have a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The fourth machine has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU, which is not an M4 configuration that we've seen so far. All four of the M4 Macs have either 16GB or 32GB of Unified Memory.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/">16GB of RAM Could Be the New Minimum in Apple's Upcoming M4 Macs</a></li></ul><br/>
Meanwhile, Apple's supply chain is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/macbook-pro-m4-pro-m4-max-production-report/">reportedly</a> beginning mass production of next-generation 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips. If Apple repeats last year's launch pattern, these machines are around two months away from being released.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone SE 4</h2><br/>
Following the release of the iPhone 16 lineup in September, Apple will release the fourth-generation iPhone SE as early as the beginning of 2025, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
The fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature an iPhone 14-like design, Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, an Action button, an Apple-designed 5G modem, an A18 processor, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. <br/>
<br/>
The device's display is expected to grow in size from 4.7 inches to 6.06 inches and use OLED for the first time, and the device will almost certainly come with 8GB of RAM, up from 4GB in the 2022 model, due to the hardware requirements of Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/apple-iphone-15-pro-requirement-apple-intelligence/">Apple Explains iPhone 15 Pro Requirement for Apple Intelligence</a></li></ul><br/>
The device could be released ahead of the Lunar New Year in January 2025. However, all three existing iPhone SE models were announced in March over the years, so a March 2025 release seems quite possible too.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>HomePod mini 2</h2><br/>
Apple's HomePod mini will be four years old in October. Gurman was first to highlight Apple's work on a second-generation HomePod mini in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/07/new-homepod-mini-and-high-end-homepod/">August 2022</a>. He also expressed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/22/gurman-apple-not-working-on-new-homepod-mini/">skepticism</a> about what a new ‌HomePod mini‌ could offer since "the latest ‌HomePod‌ doesn't include any major new functions that aren't already in the &#36;99 mini."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/HomePod-Mini-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904091" /><br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/homepod-mini-2-shipping-next-year/">February 2023</a>, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed Apple would begin mass shipments of the second-generation HomePod mini in the second half of 2024. But given how long ago Kuo made the claim, it's not clear how much weight should be given to it. And since then, rumors about the device have been scant. <br/>
<br/>
That said, it would be reasonable to assume a new model would feature improved sound and microphones, along with an updated S-series chip and new color options. If Apple wants to keep up with Amazon's rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/30/amazon-launching-new-alexa-claude-ai/">new Claude AI-powered Echo devices</a>, Apple Intelligence could also factor into a next-generation HomePod mini. <br/>
<br/>
Talking of colors: In an unusual development, Apple replaced the Space Gray with a practically identical <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/homepod-mini-midnight-color/">Midnight finish</a> just a few months ago, which would make it seem odd to expect a new model to be unveiled anytime soon, and almost certainly not at Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 event.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods Pro 3</h2><br/>
Apple is expected to release a redesigned version of the AirPods Pro in 2025, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/airpods-lineup-overhaul-2024/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The update will likely include enhanced audio quality, an improved design, and a faster chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/airpods-3-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950294" /><br/>
Apple may introduce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-case/">new hearing test feature</a> for the AirPods Pro, potentially capable of detecting hearing issues. Additionally, new health sensors are under development, which could enable features such as reading body temperature from the ear canal and enhancing hearing-related functions like Conversation Boost and Live Listen.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/ios-18-new-features-airpods-pro/">iOS 18 to Bring These 5 New Features to AirPods Pro</a></li></ul><br/>
The next-generation AirPods Pro are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/airpods-pro-3-much-better-anc-rumor/">rumored</a> to have significantly improved Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) compared to the AirPods Pro 2, although specific details on how ANC will be enhanced are not yet available.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Apple TV</h2><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/apple-roadmap-2023-24-15-new-devices/">reportedly</a> developing a new Apple TV with a faster processor while retaining the same design as the current model. Initially, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman suggested a 2024 launch for the new Apple TV, but he later indicated that an update is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/02/gurman-no-new-hardware-at-wwdc-2024/">not imminent</a>, leaving the timeline unclear.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-tv-4k-new-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953895" /><br/>
According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the next-generation Apple TV could be more affordable, and that would fit a pattern of Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">reducing the price of the device</a>. The second-generation (2010) and third-generation (2012) models of the Apple TV were both launched in the U.S. at a price of &#36;99. Apple later reduced the price of the third-generation model to &#36;69, establishing a precedent for a sub-&#36;100 Apple TV that could better compete with low-cost streaming devices from companies like Amazon and Roku.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-likely-iphone-16-launch-date/">iPhone 16 Likely to Launch on September 20 With These New Features</a></li></ul><br/>
A future version of the Apple TV might feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">built-in camera</a> for FaceTime and other video calling apps, as reported by Mark Gurman. While Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">introduced a FaceTime app</a> for the Apple TV in tvOS 17, which works via a connected iPhone or iPad, this could be a step toward an Apple TV with an integrated camera.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2024-apple-event/">September 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/what-not-to-expect-apple-glowtime-sept-9-event/">What Not to Expect at Apple Event on September 9: &#039;It&#039;s Glowtime&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-not-to-expect-at-apple-event-on-september-9-its-glowtime.2434861/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
According to a report from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, both the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 will apparently feature a new processor that succeeds last year's S9 chip. While this could "lay the groundwork for some AI enhancements down the road," it will not run Apple Intelligence and there are currently said to be no plans to bring "the full initiative" to the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been developing hypertension and sleep apnea detection features for the Apple Watch that were originally slated for release in 2024, but Gurman now says that the "effort hasn't gone smoothly" and "Apple has run into some serious snags." The hypertension detection feature has been insufficiently reliable during testing and there are concerns about integrating it into the refreshed design, which could force Apple to postpone this feature until next year. Likewise, while the Apple Watch Series 10 was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">widely rumored</a> to tout a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">thinner design</a>, that too is now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10/">in question</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the sleep apnea detection feature is now in trouble because it relies on blood oxygen saturation, which Apple Watches in the United States cannot currently measure due to an ongoing legal dispute with Masimo. Gurman postulates that the dispute with Masimo could be resolved soon, or Apple could find a way around it by arguing that the blood oxygen sensor could be used for purposes that are not directly related to blood oxygen levels. The company could also announce the sleep apnea detection feature and hold off releasing it until a later date.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="release_date">Release Date</h3><br/>
The Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 are expected to be announced at Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">"It's glowtime" event</a> on Monday, September 9. Pre-orders are likely to open on Friday, September 13, with launch following one week later on Friday, September 20.<br/>
<br/>
