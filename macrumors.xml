		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the lower-cost Apple Pencil with a USB-C port to its online refurbished store for the first time in select European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917176" /><br/>
The refurbished model is discounted by around 15% in each country. For example, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/FUWA3ZM/A/refurbished-apple-pencil-usb-c">pricing is set at £69 in the UK</a>, down from £79 brand new.<br/>
<br/>
Originally released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/usb-c-apple-pencil-hands-on/">in November 2023</a>, the lower-cost Apple Pencil has a similar design as the Apple Pencil 2 and Apple Pencil Pro, but with a USB-C port hidden under a sliding cap for charging and pairing with a USB-C cable. It attaches magnetically to any iPad with a USB-C port, but it does not support wireless charging or wireless pairing. It also lacks pressure sensitivity and a double-tap gesture for switching between drawing tools.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its refurbished products undergo full functionality testing, and are subject to a thorough cleaning process and inspection. The refurbished Apple Pencils are repackaged in a plainer white box with a refurbished label.<br/>
<br/>
Availability of the refurbished USB-C Apple Pencil will likely extend to the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries within the next few weeks.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil With USB-C Now Available in Apple&#039;s Refurbished Store in These Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-with-usb-c-now-available-in-apples-refurbished-store-in-these-countries.2430896/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/se/retail/valacentrum/">announced</a> that its retail store at the Väla Centrum shopping mall near Helsingborg, Sweden will be permanently closed after July 13. The date was spotted by Michael Steeber, who writes a <a href="https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/p/from-helsingborg-to-solna">weekly newsletter about Apple retail</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Store-Vala-Centrum-Sweden.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957755" /><em>Apple Väla Centrum</em></div><br/>
Apple in January told Swedish publication <em>Feber</em> that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/new-apple-store-opening-in-sweden/">would not be renewing its lease</a> at the mall, but it did not provide a reason for the decision. At the same time, Apple announced that it would be opening a new retail store <a href="https://www.apple.com/se/retail/mallofscandinavia/explore/">at the Mall of Scandinavia</a> near Stockholm this year, but it has yet to reveal a grand opening date for that location.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, Apple will continue to operate three retail stores in Sweden by the end of 2024. However, customers in the Helsingborg area will now have to make around a one-hour commute to Malmö to visit Apple's nearest store in the country.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-store-in-southern-sweden-closing/">Apple Store in Southern Sweden Permanently Closing Later This Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-in-southern-sweden-permanently-closing-later-this-week.2430891/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently announced that its next quarterly earnings conference call <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">will be held on Thursday, August 1</a> at 2 p.m. Pacific Time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-iPad-Air-and-iPad-Pro-11-inch-and-13-inch-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949648" /><br/>
On the call, which anyone can listen to, Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the company's earnings results for the third quarter of the 2024 fiscal year. During the quarter, spanning March 31 through June 29, Apple released new iPad Pro models with the M4 chip, new iPad Air models with the M2 chip, and the Apple Pencil Pro. Near the end of the quarter, Apple also began accepting orders for the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/vision-pro-launching-in-more-countries/">in eight more countries and regions</a>, including Australia, Canada, the U.K., China, Japan, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has not provided formal guidance since early 2020, but analysts expect the company to report quarterly revenue of &#36;77.2 billion on average, according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis?p=AAPL">Yahoo Finance</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/03/apple-3q-2023-results/">reported &#36;81.8 billion revenue</a> in the year-ago quarter.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/aapl-q3-2024-earnings-report-date/">Apple to Report Earnings Results on August 1 After Releasing New iPads</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-report-earnings-results-on-august-1-after-releasing-new-ipads.2430885/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy today has some of the biggest discounts on the M2 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro that we've tracked in months, starting as low as <a href="https://howl.me/cmCSSBYoIR3"><strong>&#36;699.00</strong></a> for the 128GB Wi-Fi 11-inch tablet. A My Best Buy Plus/Total membership is not required to see these discounts.<br/>
<br/>

Best Buy has every model of the 2022 iPad Pro on sale except the 128GB Wi-Fi model of the 12.9-inch tablet. Otherwise, you'll find every Wi-Fi tablet and every cellular tablet on sale at this time, and at record low prices with up to &#36;550 off the iPad Pro.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
With such steep savings, these previous generation iPad Pros are worth looking into purchasing for anyone who wants to prioritize saving money over owning the newest M4 iPad Pro. There are some major differences between the two generations, like the M4's support for Apple Pencil Pro and a new nano-texture display option, so be sure to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-pro-2022-vs-2024/">read about which one works best for you</a> in our Buyer's Guide.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://cmf.tech/en-gb/">CMF</a>, a London-based sub-brand of Nothing, has officially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reUBxOyfsi4">announced</a> the CMF Phone 1, boasting a highly customizable modular design and featuring some decent hardware specs for an Android smartphone that starts at just &#36;199.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/nothing-cmf-phone-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957686" /><br/>
The CMF Phone (1) is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 chipset and features a 6.67-inch FHD, 120Hz AMOLED display. There's a 50MP Sony camera on the back, accompanied by a second depth sensor for portraits, and a 16MP front-facing camera. <br/>
<br/>
A 5,000 mAh battery offers up to two days of power on a single charge, and the base model comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It also supports Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3 and 9-band Dual 5G. As it's a budget device, there are a few tradeoffs – there's no NFC, for example, and the device is only splash-resistant. There's also no wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
Look beyond the specs though, and the Android phone's big selling point is its unique screw-based system of interchangeable backplates and accessories. CMF Phone (1) users can switch out different colored shells (black, orange, blue, and light green, costing &#36;35 each) using a supplied flathead screwdriver and screws, resulting in a completely different look, right down to a color-matched SIM tray. <br/>
<br/>
One of the screw points includes a dial-style pop-out for mounting optional accessories, including a kickstand, a MagSafe-style wallet case, and lanyard, each costing &#36;25. Accompanying the release of the phone are new <a href="https://cmf.tech/en-gb/pages/buds-pro-2">CMF Buds Pro 2 wireless earbuds</a> and a <a href="https://cmf.tech/en-gb/pages/watch-pro-2">CMF Watch Pro 2 smartwatch</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/nothing-cmf-phone.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957687" /><br/>
Nothing's <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/cmf-phone-1">CMF Phone (1)</a> is launching in the UK and the EU this week, with a launch in the US scheduled for later in July under a "Beta Program," so expect high demand and a possible waitlist. The device costs &#36;199 in the US, £209 in the UK, and €239 in the EU.     <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nothing/">Nothing</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/nothing-debuts-cmf-phone-1-modular/">Nothing Debuts CMF Phone 1 With Modular Design Starting at &#36;199</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nothing-debuts-cmf-phone-1-with-modular-design-starting-at-199.2430877/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is developing a new version of the low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> with a plastic casing, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> today claimed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-se-2022.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866330" /><br/>
Writing in this weekend's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman mentioned Apple's work on an &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; that features a rigid plastic casing in lieu of anodized aluminum. He postulated that this may be one technique Apple may be planning to use to bring the cost of the &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; down. The current &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; sells for &#36;249, but Samsung's cheapest rival watch, the Galaxy Watch FE, sells for &#36;199.<br/>
<br/>
Apple famously released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 5C with an "unapologetically" plastic casing in 2013, which was effectively a rehoused version of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5. The polycarbonate exterior was available in various vibrant color options. The device was somewhat controversial because critics argued that the plastic casing was a step down from the luxurious metal finishes of previous models and some consumers felt that the device's price point was still too high for what was perceived as an inferior product.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/apple-watch-se-with-plastic-casing/">Apple Reportedly Developing Apple Watch SE With Plastic Casing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-developing-apple-watch-se-with-plastic-casing.2430833/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has Apple's AirPods 2, AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case, and AirPods Max on sale, with up to &#36;100 in savings on these earbuds. For the AirPods 3, this is the first time we've tracked a discount on the device since Father's Day in June.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-3-Discount-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895370" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The AirPods 2 are on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00, and the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case are on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1WXVQTN%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;139.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;169.00. This discount on the AirPods 2 isn't quite an all-time low price, but it's still a great deal on the headphones that's about &#36;10 higher compared to the record low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for &#36;79.99</div></a></div><br/>

This is another solid second-best price on the AirPods, and similar to the other models it'll arrive between July 9 and July 12, depending on shipping speed.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's revamped version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is unlikely to be available with the initial rollout of Apple Intelligence later this year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q">latest "Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman wrote that the full new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; should arrive with iOS 18.4 in the spring of 2025, preceded by a beta testing period that is due to start in January. The more capable version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; allows the voice assistant to control actions within Apps, allowing it to understand what is currently on-screen and determine what to do based on context.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence launches in the fall. While the entire new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will not be available at this time, other &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features, such as a new design and ChatGPT integration, should be present upon the debut of Apple Intelligence this year. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier today, Gurman explained that both the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">feature a new processor</a> that succeeds last year's S9 chip. While this could "lay the groundwork for some AI enhancements down the road," it will not run Apple Intelligence and there are currently said to be no plans to bring "the full initiative" to the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">previously reported</a> that Apple Intelligence will come to the Vision Pro headset next year. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, on the other hand, is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">not slated</a> to get the new suite of features, with the company holding off for a new "AI-powered table-top robot."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/new-siri-experience-to-debut-spring-2025/">New Siri Experience With Apple Intelligence Likely to Debut in Spring 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-siri-experience-with-apple-intelligence-likely-to-debut-in-spring-2025.2430831/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Series 10 will feature a larger display and a new chip, but new health monitoring features for the device are now in question, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/f1662570472.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-861885" /><br/>
In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q">latest edition</a> of his "Power On" newsletter, Gurman said that the design of the Apple Watch Series 10 is "unlikely to look much different" to its predecessor, but it will be thinner. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch Ultra will not get a new design this year.<br/>
<br/>
The new Apple Watch "Series" models will continue to be available in two casing sizes codenamed "N217" and "N218," and feature larger displays. One of the models will have a screen roughly as large as that of the Apple Watch Ultra. <br/>
<br/>
Both the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 will apparently feature a new processor that succeeds last year's S9 chip. While this could "lay the groundwork for some AI enhancements down the road," it will not run Apple Intelligence and there are currently said to be no plans to bring "the full initiative" to the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been developing hypertension and sleep apnea detection features for the Apple Watch that were originally slated for release in 2024, but Gurman now says that the "effort hasn't gone smoothly" and "Apple has run into some serious snags." The hypertension detection feature has been insufficiently reliable during testing and there are concerns about integrating it into the refreshed design, which could force Apple to postpone this feature until next year<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the sleep apnea detection feature is now in trouble because it relies on blood oxygen saturation, which Apple Watches in the United States cannot currently measure due to an ongoing legal dispute with Masimo. Gurman postulates that the despute with Mazimo could be resolved by September, or Apple could find a way around it by arguing that the blood oxygen sensor could be used for purposes that are not directly related to blood oxygen levels. The company could also announce the sleep apnea detection feature and hold off releasing it until a later date. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is also purportedly continuing testing and discussing the prospect of 3D-printed casings for some Apple Watch models, which could accelerate production and use less material.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says it is still not clear whether Apple will brand the new Apple Watches as special anniversary models or wait until next year, given that the original Apple Watch was announced in 2014 and released in 2015.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the calendar flipping over to July, public betas of iOS 18 and related operating system updates are right around the corner, so we're continuing to take a look at what changes and features users can expect to see.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/top-stories-6jul2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957645" /><br/>
Other Apple news and rumors this week included several iconic devices being added to Apple's list of "vintage" products, a leak from Apple's servers pointing to work on a rumored "Home Accessory" separate from the Apple TV and HomePod, and a rumor about which other products may gain support for Apple Intelligence features, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18: 10 New Home Screen and Lock Screen Features</h2><br/>
iOS 18 features a more customizable Home Screen, with dark and tinted options for app icons, the ability to place app icons anywhere on the grid, and more. In addition, the Flashlight and Camera shortcuts at the bottom of the Lock Screen can now be assigned to other actions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Home-Screen-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957461" /><br/>
To learn more, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-home-screen/">check out our list of 10 new Home Screen and Lock Screen features on iOS 18</a>. The update is compatible with the iPhone XS and newer, and it is in developer beta now ahead of a public beta later this month and a full release likely in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Says iPhone X, HomePod, and Original AirPods Now 'Vintage'</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/iphone-x-homepod-and-original-airpods-now-vintage/">added three more significant devices to its vintage products list this week</a>, including the iPhone X, the first-generation HomePod, and the original AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iphone-x-gradient.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957626" /><br/>
Apple considers a product to be "vintage" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers can continue to offer repairs for vintage products for up to two years, but only if the necessary parts remain available.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Leak Confirms Apple's Work On 'Home Accessory'</h2><br/>
An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/">unreleased device with the identifier "HomeAccessory17,1"</a> has been spotted in code on Apple's servers, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" /><em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/">MacRumors mockup</a> of rumored HomePod with display on a robotic arm</em></div><br/>
This leak follows reports from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman that said Apple was developing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/">new version of the HomePod with a built-in display</a>. Like existing HomePods, the new model is expected to run a variant of tvOS.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Gurman: Apple Intelligence Coming to Vision Pro, But Not HomePod</h2><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman this week said that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">Apple Intelligence suite of AI features will be available on the Vision Pro headset in the future</a>, but unfortunately not on existing HomePod models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
It is believed that existing HomePods lack sufficient RAM to power Apple Intelligence features smoothly, but it is possible that the features will be available on the rumored HomePod with a display in the future.<br/>
<br/>

The Apple Watch Series X, coming ten years after the Apple Watch was originally announced alongside the iPhone 6, was initially rumored to be a major overhaul of the device. Now, it looks like the upgrade will be more minor than expected, focusing on new casing and display sizes, but with a design that continues to be effectively the same, so Dan, Hartley, and Luke delve into the conflicting rumors.<br/>

<h2>Kuo: New AirPods to Feature Cameras for Enhanced Spatial Experiences</h2><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/">mass produce new AirPods with at least one built-in infrared camera by 2026</a>, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>

Kuo said the infrared cameras could allow for future AirPods to feature in-air gesture controls, and enhanced compatibility with the Vision Pro headset. For example, he said when a user looks in a certain direction, spatial audio could be optimized accordingly.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today said it has approved the third-party <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> Store in the European Union, allowing the Fortnite developer to launch its alternative app marketplace in those countries, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/epic-games-says-apple-stalling-launch-its-game-store-europe-2024-07-05/">reports <em>Reuters</em></a>. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/fortnite-epic-game-store-submitted-apple/">submitted</a> the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store</a> to Apple for notarization earlier this week.<br/>

Earlier today, Epic stated Apple had <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809179985682325649">twice rejected</a> the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store this week, with Apple reportedly claiming that an "Install" button and "in-app purchases" labels were too similar to Apple's own elements for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Epic argued that the rejection was "arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA [Digital Markets Act]" and that it was reporting the issue to the European Commission, but it appears Apple has relented and <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809321159906980133">approved Epic's previously rejected submission</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; and Apple have been engaged in a years-long battle over Apple's closed &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; ecosystem, and Epic has been eager to launch its own marketplace in the EU under Apple's new policies driven by the Digital Markets Act.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/apple-approves-epic-games-store-eu/">Apple Approves Epic Games Store for iPhone and iPad in EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-approves-epic-games-store-for-iphone-and-ipad-in-eu.2430756/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTuber and podcaster Luke Miani joins us on this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/will-apple-watch-x-be-a-disappointing-upgrade-ft-luke-miani/id1602394741?i=1000661253757">The MacRumors Show</a> to discuss all the latest rumors about the upcoming Apple Watch "Series X."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_4FpYQOt3I?si=eS-bxLPZWdBz8Z5W" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The Apple Watch Series X, coming ten years after the Apple Watch was originally announced alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 6, was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">initially rumored</a> to be a major overhaul of the device. Now, it looks like the upgrade will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/kuo-2024-apple-watch-no-significant-innovation/">more minor than expected</a>, focusing on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">new casing and display sizes</a>, but with a design that continues to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10/">effectively the same</a>. The current 41mm and 45mm casing options are likely to be replaced with 45mm and 49mm models, meaning that the larger model would be the same size as the Apple Watch Ultra. The two models are expected to offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/08/apple-watch-series-x-larger-display-rumor/">1.89-inch and 2.04-inch display sizes</a>, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series X could also feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/apple-watch-2024-health-features/">hypertension and sleep apnea detection</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/2024-apple-watch-more-power-efficient-display/">more efficient display</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/next-apple-watch-thinner-logic-board-rumor/">thinner logic board</a>. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is expected to be largely the same as the previous model, but potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">adding a black color option</a> and the health features also coming to the Series X. A third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> could also be on the way with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/08/apple-watch-series-x-larger-display-rumor/">larger casing and display sizes</a> of the Apple Watch Series 7, increasing from 40mm and 44mm to 41mm and 45mm. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> will gain the tetraprism periscope camera with 5x optical zoom that debuted last year on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240704PD215/gseo-apple-periscope-lens-adoption-iphone.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-camera.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910485" /><br/>
Taiwanese lens manufacturers Largan Precision and Genius Electronic Optical (GSEO) are said to be the primary suppliers for the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s tetraprism camera components. Sources close to the supply chain have indicated that both Largan and GSEO are now ramping up production in preparation for the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup.<br/>
<br/>
Largan, which supplied the periscope lenses for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, is expected to secure a substantial portion of the orders once again. Largan's chairman, Adam Lin, recently indicated that the optical components sector is expected to see peak sales from September to November, aligning with the anticipated release period for the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models. <br/>
<br/>
GSEO, a new entrant in the supply chain for this component, is reportedly undergoing quality testing with promising results. According to <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em>, GSEO's periscope lenses are currently undergoing validation, with production expected to begin in mid-July if they pass the necessary tests. <br/>
<br/>
The tetraprism periscope lens introduced on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max offers up to 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom – a major improvement over previous models, which were limited to 3x optical zoom at most. In addition to the advancements in optical zoom with the telephoto camera, the periscope lens is also expected to improve overall image stabilization and low-light performance.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/apple-to-bring-5x-telephoto-to-iphone-16-pro/">Apple Again Rumored to Bring 5x Telephoto Camera to iPhone 16 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-again-rumored-to-bring-5x-telephoto-camera-to-iphone-16-pro.2430740/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's deal with Google that makes it the default engine on Safari faces uncertainty as the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit looms, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-struggles-to-lessen-reliance-on-apple-safari"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/safari-icon-blue-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833485" /><br/>
Apple's contract with Google, which ensures that Google's search engine is the default on Apple's Safari browser, has been a significant source of revenue. In 2022, the arrangement reportedly netted Apple over &#36;20 billion, an amount derived from 36 percent of the ad revenue generated by searches on Safari, as revealed in court documents.<br/>
<br/>
The agreement has substantial financial implications for both companies. For Apple, the payments from Google constitute an important revenue stream as a significant proportion of its profits. If the court rules against Google, it could lose access to approximately 70 percent of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> searches. This would significantly impact Google's mobile search advertising revenue, which was a major contributor to its &#36;207 billion in search ad revenue in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Google has been working to reduce its reliance on the deal. The company has been actively encouraging &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to switch from Safari to its own apps, Google and Chrome. Google has invested heavily in enhancing its mobile apps with features such as the Lens image search function and the Discover feed, which surfaces personalized content. In 2022 and 2023, Google launched extensive TV and online advertising campaigns showcasing exclusive features available only on its apps. However, over the past five years, Google has only  managed to increase the percentage of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; searches conducted through its apps from 25 percent to the low 30s. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Google hired Robby Stein, a former Instagram and Yahoo executive, to spearhead efforts to increase the adoption of its apps among &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users. Stein's strategies include exploring the integration of generative AI to enhance the appeal of Google's mobile apps. The company now wants to double the number of Google searches performed outside Safari, even as the number accomplished in the Google and Chrome apps stalled last year.<br/>
<br/>
The shift is particularly important to Google in an effort to mitigate the impact of the potential outcome of the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit. A ruling against Google would also set a precedent for how Apple's default settings and competitive practices are regulated.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/antitrust-lawsuit-threatens-apple-deal-with-google/">Antitrust Lawsuit Threatens Apple&#039;s Lucrative Deal with Google</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/antitrust-lawsuit-threatens-apples-lucrative-deal-with-google.2430736/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In 2025, Apple is expected to discontinue the iPhone "Plus" device in its iPhone 17 lineup to make way for an iPhone "Slim" – although it may not actually be called this when it debuts in the fall of next year. Even though the iPhone 16 series launch is still over two months away, when you consider that we learned about larger displays on the iPhone 16 Pro models way back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">May 2023</a>, rumors about a two-generations-away iPhone isn't all that unusual so far ahead of time. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-17-Plus-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952009" /><br/>
While we await this year's iPhone 16 series, here's a compilation of everything we have heard from reputable sources so far about Apple's so-called iPhone 17 "Slim." <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">iPhone 17 Slim: Rumors So Far</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Thinner Design</span><br><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025">The Information</a></em>, Apple's all-new iPhone 17 model next year will have a "significantly thinner" design with an aluminum chassis, rather than a titanium casing like Apple's Pro models. The news outlet also claims that the device will feature a narrower Dynamic Island, potentially due to Apple's adoption of a smaller "metalens" for the Face ID system. Internally code-named D23, the device's redesign has been described as a major one equivalent to the iPhone X.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Smaller Display</span><br><br/>
The first details about the size of the device's display arrived courtesy of Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who said it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">6.6 inches</a>. However, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young</a>, it will feature a 6.55-inch display. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Plus has a 6.7-inch display. Apple is still said to be testing different designs for the slimmer phone, so the display size could always change between now and the device's launch.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Relocated Cameras</span><br><br/>
<em>The Information</em> claimed that the iPhone 17 "Slim" will have cameras in locations we haven't seen before on an iPhone. According to a May report, the rear cameras could be moved to the "top center" of the device. Some Android phones like Google's Pixel 8 Pro have rear cameras in a top-center position, but Apple's iPhone camera system has occupied the top-left corner ever since the 2007 model. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Anti-Reflective Coating</span><br><br/>
All iPhone 17 models will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">Chinese Weibo leaker Instant Digital</a>. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 series is said to have a "super-hard anti-reflective layer" that is "more scratch-resistant." It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">ProMotion Technology</span><br><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/iphone-17-always-on-promotion-displays/">The Elec</a></em>, all iPhone 17 models will feature OLED displays with low-power backplane technology, bringing ProMotion to Apple's non-Pro iPhone models for the first time. ProMotion allows the display to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when required. ProMotion also allows the display to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, which is why the iPhone 15 Pro screens feature an always-on capability that shows the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Improved Selfie Camera</span><br><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the entire iPhone 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and this year's iPhone 16 lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. The upgraded resolution on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Internal Upgrades</span><br><br/>
Haitong analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">claims</a> the iPhone 17 "Slim" will feature 8GB of RAM, compared to 6GB of RAM on the iPhone 15 Plus. It's worth noting that all upcoming iPhone 16 models are expected to be fitted with 8GB of RAM – a hardware requirement of on-device Apple Intelligence. According to <em>The Information</em>, the device will also be equipped with Apple's A19 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Higher Price</span><br><br/>
<em>The Information</em> reported that the slimmer iPhone 17 could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which currently starts at &#36;1,199, suggesting that the device would become the ew highest-end model in the lineup, bettering the iPhone 17 Pro Max. If that's the case, then perhaps the "iPhone Slim" will end up being the "iPhone Ultra" that has been rumored for several years.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">iPhone 17 &#039;Slim&#039;: Everything We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know-so-far.2430727/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Twilio has updated its Authy two-factor authentication (2FA) service after a hacker claimed to have retrieved 33 million phone numbers from its user database.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/authy.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957591" /><br/>
<em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/03/twilio-says-hackers-identified-cell-phone-numbers-of-two-factor-app-authy-users/">TechCrunch</a></em> reports that the hacker(s) known as ShinyHunters took to a well-known hacking forum to boast about the theft of 33 million cell phone numbers, achieved by what Twilio described as the use of an "authenticated endpoint." <br/>
<br/>
The U.S. messaging giant confirmed this week that "threat actors" gained access to its servers, resulting in the theft of users' phone numbers, but it did not specify how many were accessed. The company said it had taken action to secure the exploit and prevent similar future unauthenticated requests.<br/>
<blockquote>"We have seen no evidence that the threat actors obtained access to Twilio's systems or other sensitive data," said the company in a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/en-us/changelog/Security_Alert_Authy_App_Android_iOS">blog post</a>. "While Authy accounts are not compromised, threat actors may try to use the phone number associated with Authy accounts for phishing and smishing attacks; we encourage all Authy users to stay diligent and have heightened awareness around the texts they are receiving."</blockquote>As Twilio notes, obtaining a list of phone numbers may not appear in itself to pose a severe security threat. However, attackers could conceivably contact users and claim to be Authy or Twilio representatives in order to get them to reveal personal information as part of a phishing campaign. <br/>
<br/>
Users should update to the latest version of the iOS app, available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Twilio also advises users who cannot access their Authy account to contact its support team immediately.<br/>

At the beginning of the year, Authy announced that it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/authy-desktop-apps-end-of-life-march-2024/">shutting down</a> its Mac and Linux desktop apps in August 2024, but ended up bringing the date forward.

		<description><![CDATA[Code discovered on Apple's backend by <em>MacRumors</em> confirms Apple is indeed working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/27/touchscreen-homepod-everything-we-know/">long-rumored</a> home accessory in addition to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" /><br/>
The code references a device with the identifier "HomeAccessory17,1," which is a new identifier category. The name is similar to the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;'s "AudioAccessory" identifier.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, the 17,1 in the identifier name suggests that this device may receive Apple's upcoming A18 chip, which will be used in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/iphone-16-models-a18-chip/">all four iPhone 16 models</a> later this year. With the A18 chip, the HomeAccessory device would have the power for Apple Intelligence. <br/>
<br/>
The code also indicates that this "home accessory" will be running a software variant of tvOS, much like the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;. Earlier this year, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/">found evidence</a> of Apple's work on homeOS, which could be the firmware running on this device.<br/>
<br/>
On a similar note, the code also references two unreleased &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models with the identifiers AppleTV14,4 and AppleTV14,5. Rumors suggest</a> that an updated &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; could launch in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce new iPhones, iPads, and potentially other products in September.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI has issued an update to its <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/mac/">ChatGPT app for Mac</a>, after a developer discovered the app was locally storing users' conversations with the chatbot in plain text.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/2chatgpt-mac-app.jpg" alt="" width="2940" height="1912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951953" /><br/>
Pedro José Pereira Vieito told <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191636/openai-chatgpt-mac-app-conversations-plain-text">The Verge</a></em>'s Jay Peters: "I was curious about why OpenAI opted out of using the app sandbox protections and ended up checking where they stored the app data." <br/>
<br/>
That led Pereira Vieito to develop "ChatGPTStealer," a simple app to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@pvieito/post/C85NVV6hvF6?xmt=AQGz0o3JtBOwk1nfUgk8lvxQoIV8E92xz1vK1IP8VC6zhA">demonstrate</a> how easy it is to load the chats in a text window outside of the ChatGPT app. After successfully trying out the app for himself, Peters said he was also able to see the text of conversations on his computer just by changing the file name, indicating the extent of the privacy risk.<br/>
<br/>
The ChatGPT Mac app is available solely through OpenAI's website, which is why it has not been obligated to follow Apple's sandboxing requirements that apply to software distributed via the Mac App Store. The oversight basically meant any other running app or process could potentially access the ChatGPT conversations without prompting the user for permission.<br/>

After <em>The Verge</em> contacted OpenAI about the issue, the company released an update that it says encrypts the chats. "We are aware of this issue and have shipped a new version of the application which encrypts these conversations," OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson told the website.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will reportedly use a more advanced SoIC packaging technology for its M5 chips, as part of a two-pronged strategy to meet its growing need for silicon that can power consumer Macs and enhance the performance of its data centers and future AI tools that rely on the cloud.<br/>
<br/>

Developed by TSMC and unveiled in 2018, SoIC (System on Integrated Chip) technology allows for the stacking of chips in a three-dimensional structure, providing better electrical performance and thermal management compared to traditional two-dimensional chip designs. <br/>
<br/>
According to the <em>Economic Daily</em>, Apple has expanded its cooperation with TSMC on a next-generation hybrid SoIC package that additionally combines thermoplastic carbon fiber composite molding technology. The package is said to be in a small trial production phase, with the intention of mass producing the chips in 2025 and 2026 for new Macs and AI cloud servers.<br/>
<br/>
References to what are believed to be Apple's M5 chip have already been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/a19-and-m5-chips-discovered/">discovered</a> in official Apple code. Apple has been working on processors for its own AI servers made with TSMC's 3nm process, targeting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/">mass production by the second half of 2025</a>. However, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/">Haitong analyst Jeff Pu</a>, Apple's plans in late 2025 are to assemble AI servers powered by its M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Apple's AI cloud servers are believed to be running on multiple connected M2 Ultra chips, which were originally designed solely for desktop Macs. Whenever the M5 is adopted, its advanced dual-use design is believed to be a sign of Apple future-proofing its plan to vertically integrate its supply chain for AI functionality across computers, cloud servers, and software.<br/>
