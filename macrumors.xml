		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is an update designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but it adds several new features to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, Apple's latest earbuds. The new capabilities require &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> and a firmware update that will be released when Apple releases its new software this fall.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-and-AirPods-Pro-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956922" /><br/>
This guide highlights all of the changes that are coming to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="head_gestures">Head Gestures</h2><br/>
If you've ever been in a situation where you needed to confirm a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> request or decline a call without using a voice command or your hands, there's a solution coming.<br/>
<br/>
Head gestures are a new form of &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; control that will let you nod your head up and down or shake it back and forth to decline a call or interact with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. When you get a call, you can essentially shake your head no to decline it or nod yes to accept it.<br/>
<br/>
When you're responding to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; for controlling notifications and incoming or outgoing messages, you can use the same gestures for yes and no without having to speak.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="voice_isolation">Voice Isolation</h2><br/>
With Voice Isolation, the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; can cut down on loud background sounds when you're on a phone call, allowing the person you're speaking with to hear you more clearly.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/airpods-pro-voice-isolation.jpg" alt="" width="1380" height="776" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957064" /><br/>
The &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; will use machine learning to detect and isolate ambient noise such as wind, cars nearby, people speaking, and more, blocking out the sound and prioritizing your voice. Voice Isolation is a feature coming to both the original &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; and the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="better_adaptive_audio_controls">Better Adaptive Audio Controls</h2><br/>
Adaptive Noise Control is designed to adjust Active Noise Cancellation and the sound you hear in response to the ambient noise in your environment. Adaptive Audio has been an all or nothing setting, but with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, there are more granular controls for tweaking the feature to allow for more or less noise to come through.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/airpods-adaptive-audio.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955239" /><br/>
<h2 id="personalized_spatial_audio_for_gaming">Personalized Spatial Audio for Gaming</h2><br/>
Personalized Spatial Audio is a feature that already exists for movies, TV shows, and music. It uses the TrueDepth camera on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to scan your face and ears, developing a personal profile that customizes Spatial Audio just for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Spatial-Audio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1698" height="978" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787199" /><br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, Apple is expanding Personalized Spatial Audio to gaming, with the aim of delivering more immersive sound for gameplay. Game developers can incorporate spatial audio in their games as part of this change. Personalized Spatial Audio for Gaming is actually coming to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, and the third-generation AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="voice_quality_in_games">Voice Quality in Games</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 feature voice quality improvements for in-game chat and streaming, along with dynamic head tracking and support for 16-bit 48kHz audio in games.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="lower_latency">Lower Latency</h2><br/>
According to Apple, the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; provide the best wireless audio latency ever for mobile gaming, thanks to improvements coming in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. Improved latency means that you'll see little to no delay when taking an action in the game and hearing the resulting sound, making for a more responsive experience.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_airpods_models">Other AirPods Models</h2><br/>
Many of these features are limited to the latest &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; models. Head gestures and Voice Isolation won't be available on devices other than the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2, but Personalized Spatial Audio for gaming will be more widely accessible.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="read_more">Read More</h2><br/>
Much more on all of the new features that Apple added in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">can be found in our iOS 18 roundup</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-airpods-pro/">Six New Features iOS 18 Brings to the AirPods Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/six-new-features-ios-18-brings-to-the-airpods-pro.2432312/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[T-Mobile customers have filed a lawsuit [<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/t-mobile-class-action-lawsuit-lifetime-price-guarantee/">PDF</a>] against the carrier, alleging that it failed to honor a guarantee not to raise the prices of select cellular plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/T-Mobile-Generic-Feature-Pink-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951944" /><br/>
The lawsuit, first spotted by <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/t-mobile-class-action-lawsuit-lifetime-price-guarantee/">Wired</a></em>, claims that back in 2017, T-Mobile advertised several of its plans <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/un-carrier-next">with a price lock</a>, but then went on to increase prices starting in May 2024.<br/>
<br/>
"T-Mobile ONE customers keep their price until THEY decide to change it. T-Mobile will never change the price you pay for your T-Mobile ONE plan," T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/un-carrier-next">said in a press release</a> in January 2017. T-Mobile ONE was priced at &#36;40 per line for a family of four with AutoPay enabled, and T-Mobile made similar pricing promises for other plans, including the Simple Choice Plan, Magenta, Magenta Max, Magenta 55+, and Magenta Amplified options.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile raised prices by &#36;2 to &#36;5 per line for the legacy plans, and while there was a price promise, fine print did give the company an out. T-Mobile released an FAQ that said if prices did increase, T-Mobile customers could cancel and get their final bill paid, a policy applicable for accounts activated between January 2017 and April 28, 2022.<br/>
<br/>
The lawsuit claims that T-Mobile's FAQ wording is "contrary to the language" provided at the time that T-Mobile customers signed up for their legacy plans, and as such, T-Mobile has "breached its agreement" with customers and caused them monetary injury.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile is being accused of making false or misleading statements, deceiving customers, and intentionally concealing plans to raise rates. Plaintiffs are seeking class action status for the suit, an injunction preventing T-Mobile from raising prices, restitution for "all amounts" T-Mobile earned from its misconduct, refunds for the additional money paid after price increases, and additional damages for injuries suffered.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/26/t-mobile-price-guarantee-lawsuit/">T-Mobile Sued for Breaking Lifetime Price Guarantees</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-sued-for-breaking-lifetime-price-guarantees.2432307/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded new fourth betas of upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a few days after Apple initially released the betas. It is not clear what is different with the original beta 4 software (build (22A5316j) and the new beta 4 software (build (22A5316k), but the update is available to all developers.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;‌ Developer Beta setting. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, a set of AI features that are built deeply into the operating system. Apple Intelligence won't be coming until later in the beta testing process, but it includes features for refining and editing writing, generating images and emoji, and most notably, improving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and search. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is gaining a better understanding of natural language, improved contextual awareness, and the personal assistant will integrate with ChatGPT to answer more complex queries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads with an M-series chip, but there are a number of other features that are coming. Apple is allowing users to rearrange Home screen apps to have open spaces, plus there's a dark mode for app icons and tinting options.<br/>
<br/>
The Control Center is customizable and third-party developers can add controls for their apps, with the Lock Screen Flashlight and Camera icons able to be replaced or removed. Messages is gaining Rich Communication Services support to improve conversations with Android users, the option to schedule texts to be sent later, new text effects, messages over satellite when there's no cellular, and the option to use any emoji for Tapback responses.<br/>
<br/>
There's a dedicated Passwords app for logins, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes, and there's now an option to lock and hide apps, which means they can't be opened without secondary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication even when your phone is unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
Safari has a highlights feature that summarizes articles and surfaces key information on websites, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app interface has been overhauled, and there's a new Tap to Cash feature for privately and securely transferring money using Apple Cash. Other features include equation solving and voice memo transcription in Notes, a game mode for improving game performance, and an option to respond to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on AirPods with head gestures.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is only available to registered developers at the current time, but Apple plans to make a public beta later this month. &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; will see a public launch this fall.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/26/apple-seeds-updated-ios-18-beta-4/">Apple Seeds Updated Fourth Betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-updated-fourth-betas-of-ios-18-and-ipados-18-to-developers.2432303/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>X Training Grok AI On Tweets Without Notifying Users</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Social network X (formerly Twitter) recently activated a setting that gives it permission to train Grok AI on user tweets. All X users are opted in by default, with X failing to notify customers about the change.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/X-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904140" /><br/>
The hidden setting gives X permission to use all posts, interactions, inputs, and results for "training and fine-turning" Elon Musk's Grok AI model.<br/>
<blockquote>To continuously improve your experience, we may utilize your X posts as well as your user interactions, inputs and results with Grok for training and fine-tuning purposes. This also means that your interactions, inputs, and results may also be shared with our service provider xAI for these purposes. Learn more</blockquote><br/>
While X turned the setting on for all users by default, it can be turned off on the website. Here's how:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Open up X using a web browser on a Mac or PC and log in.</li><br/>
 	<li>Click on More.</li><br/>
 	<li>Choose Settings and privacy.</li><br/>
 	<li>Click on Privacy and safety.</li><br/>
 	<li>Click on Grok.</li><br/>
 	<li>Uncheck the setting that allows Grok to use your content.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
This privacy setting is not available through the X app, so it must be disabled using the desktop version of X, though an option to turn it off on mobile devices is supposedly coming soon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All X users have the ability to control whether their public posts can be used to train Grok, the AI search assistant. This option is in addition to your existing controls over whether your interactions, inputs, and results related to Grok can be utilized. This setting is…</p>&mdash; Safety (@Safety) <a href="https://twitter.com/Safety/status/1816874083721838921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Turning on a data collection feature surreptitiously and automatically opting in users without their consent is underhanded, and many X users are not happy with the social network's decision.<br/>
<br/>
Sometime in the last month, X updated its Help Center to change the wording around Grok. It previously said that "user interactions, inputs, and results" would be used for Grok training, but now the wording also includes X posts.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240627145617/https://help.x.com/en/using-x/about-grok">June 27 wording</a>:</strong><br/>
<blockquote>To continually improve the AI system and provide a better user experience, we may utilize user interactions, inputs and results for training and fine-tuning purposes. This means that when you interact with Grok, your interactions, inputs and results may be used to train and enhance the system's performance.</blockquote><strong>Today's wording:</strong><blockquote>To continuously improve your experience, we may utilize your X posts as well as your user interactions, inputs and results with Grok for training and fine-tuning purposes. This also means that when you interact with Grok, your interactions, inputs and results may be used to train and enhance the system's performance.</blockquote>Grok has previously been able to access "real-time public X posts" to respond to user queries, but it is not clear if X posts were being used for training. The opt-out toggle seems to have been enabled around May, so it's possible that's when user posts were first used for improving the chatbot.<br/>
<br/>
X says that user interactions with the chatbot and X posts are used for the following:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Enhance Grok's understanding of human language and communication.</li><br/>
 	<li>Improve Grok's ability to provide accurate, relevant, and engaging responses.</li><br/>
 	<li>Develop Grok's sense of humor and wit to make interactions more enjoyable.</li><br/>
 	<li>Ensure Grok remains politically unbiased and provides balanced answers.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1815325410667749760">claimed earlier this week</a> that Grok was being trained on "the most powerful AI training cluster in the world."

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with GRID Studio to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 256GB 13-inch M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> from Apple. For those unfamiliar with GRID Studio, it is a company that creates clever art for Apple fans by disassembling old iPhones and Apple products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Grid-1st-gen_01.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934265" /><br/>
GRID Studio's pieces feature a deconstructed Apple product with the components displayed and labeled underneath a glass frame. There are multiple options, so you can choose your favorite classic <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">GRID 1</a> is one of GRID Studio's most popular options because it features the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple released. Priced at &#36;400, the GRID 1 includes the iconic curved shell from the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, which is displayed alongside components like the home button, power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, circuit board, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/grid-studio-iphone-2g.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960096" /><br/>
Each component is labeled so you know what's what, and there are also interesting and useful tidbits about the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; included. Note that because these pieces are made from old, recycled iPhones, there may be a bit of wear and tear.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/framed-iphone-3g">&#36;199 GRID 3G features</a> Apple's second-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, which came out in 2008. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 3G was similar in design to the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but it had a black or white polycarbonate chassis instead of aluminum. It was notable because it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that included GPS and 3G data connectivity, an upgrade over 2G.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/grid-studio-iphone-3g.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960097" /><br/>
The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/framed-iphone-4">&#36;139 GRID 4</a> showcases yet another classic &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4. Released in 2010, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4 marked the first redesign to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; since its 2007 launch. The design included a stainless steel frame with squared-off edges, and it's a look that Apple re-adopted starting with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4 had Apple's first Retina Display and the first front-facing camera with accompanying <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> videochatting service. It was equipped with the A4 chip and a gyroscopic sensor, with all of these components included in the GRID piece.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/weird-iphone-17-slim-rumors/id1602394741?i=1000663439772">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss all of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">latest rumors</a> about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> "Slim" – a whole new kind of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> coming next year.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6OkQwwmLztE?si=3YPPN3pSEq7_sEdP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Slim" is expected to sit above the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro Max in 2025's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup with a starting price of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/">approximately &#36;1,299</a>. The main selling point is said to be its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">all-new design</a> touting a super-thin aluminium-titanium chassis and a relocated rear camera that could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/iphone-17-mechanical-aperture-rumor/">feature a variable aperture</a> for the first time. It is expected to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/">6.6-inch display</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">Apple's custom 5G modem</a>, and it may also feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/iphone-qlc-storage-rumor/">up to 2TB of storage</a>. Despite its high price point, the device is rumored to contain lower-end specifications than the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro models, such as a single rear camera, a standard A19 chip, and 8GB of memory.<br/>
<br/>
We also discuss the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/iphone-16-pro-rose-color-coming/">rumored Rose color option</a> that looks set to replace Blue Titanium, Apple's progress on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/foldable-iphone-2026-report/">clamshell foldable iPhone</a>, and the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, which is apparently set to hit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/iphone-se-4-october-production-report/">mass production in October</a>. The new low-cost &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is expected to feature an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14-like design <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year/">with an OLED display and Face ID</a>, a USB-C port, a single rear 48-megapixel camera, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">Apple's custom 5G modem</a>, and the Action button.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For the first time in years, Apple has fallen out of the top five smartphone vendors in China, ranking sixth in the second quarter of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-lineup-store.jpg" alt="" width="2976" height="1538" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911377" /><br/>
Data from <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q2-2024">Canalys</a>, a market research firm, shows that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> shipments in China declined by 6.7% year-on-year. This drop has been attributed to fierce competition from domestic brands such as Huawei, Vivo, Oppo, Honor, and Xiaomi. Huawei, in particular, has seen a resurgence in the high-end smartphone market, fueled by advanced chips produced entirely in China.<br/>
<br/>
Canalys reported that the overall Chinese smartphone market experienced a 10% year-on-year growth in the second quarter of 2024, with shipments exceeding 70 million units. Vivo reclaimed the number one spot by shipping 13.1 million units, capturing a 19% market share. Oppo followed with 11.3 million units, Honor with 10.7 million units, and Huawei with 10.6 million units. Xiaomi re-entered the top five with a 17% year-on-year increase, shipping 10 million units. In contrast, Apple's shipments dropped to 9.7 million units, representing a 14% market share.<br/>
<br/>
The increased competition and market dynamics in China have posed significant challenges for Apple. The company's market share decreased from 16% in the previous year to 14%, pushing it from third to sixth place. Despite promotional efforts, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/apple-offers-rare-iphone-discounts-china/">significant discounts</a> of up to 23%, Apple has struggled to maintain its market position. The competitive landscape has been further complicated by the overall growth of local vendors, which have benefited from their localized supply chains and strong brand loyalty among Chinese consumers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/new-apple-lab-in-china-to-test-products/">recently visited China</a>, meeting with officials in Beijing and Shenzhen to reinforce Apple's commitment to the Chinese market. Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong emphasized the importance of the company localizing Apple Intelligence for China within the next year to regain market share. The anticipated release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup later this year is also expected to drive demand and potentially improve Apple's market position.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/canalys/">Canalys</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/26/apple-drops-to-sixth-place-in-china/">Apple Drops to Sixth Place in China&#039;s Smartphone Market</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-drops-to-sixth-place-in-chinas-smartphone-market.2432269/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has reduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> prices in India for the first time following a cut in import duties and is considering assembling iPads in the country for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Apple-BKC-Mumbai-India-media-preview-hero.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-892713" /><br/>
As noted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/26/apple-cuts-iphone-price-in-india-amid-china-slowdown/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Apple has lowered the prices of its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models in India by 3-4% after the Indian government <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-expansion-in-india-to-accelerate/">reduced import duties on smartphones</a> from 20% to 15% in its annual budget on July 23. This price reduction marks the first time Apple has decreased prices on its Pro models in India, with the cuts ranging from 300 rupees (&#36;3.60) for models like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, 14, and 15, to up to 6,000 rupees (&#36;71.70) for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
In parallel with these price adjustments, Foxconn, Apple's main contract manufacturer, is reportedly exploring the possibility of assembling iPads at its facility in Tamil Nadu, India, according to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/foxconn-eyes-major-expansion-in-india-plans-to-assemble-apple-ipads-at-tamil-nadu-facility/articleshow/112024233.cms"><em>The Economic Times</em></a>. This would mark a significant expansion from Foxconn's current focus on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; production in India and reflects confidence in India's growing supply chain capabilities, aligning with Apple's broader strategy to diversify its manufacturing base away from China. Discussions between Foxconn and the Indian government have apparently already taken place.<br/>
<br/>
The reduction in import duties is part of India's broader economic strategy to boost local manufacturing and integrate more deeply into the global electronics supply chain. By lowering the cost of high-end smartphones like the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, the Indian government aims to make these devices more accessible to a larger segment of the population. This also supports Apple's ongoing efforts to expand its footprint in the Indian market, which has become increasingly important as growth in more established markets like China has slowed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's assembly operations in India have seen significant growth in recent years. Currently, about 14% of all iPhones are produced in India, a number that is expected to increase as Foxconn and other partners expand their facilities in the country. Foxconn has already invested heavily in new manufacturing plants in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and the prospect of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> assembly in India could see Apple's presence in the country increase even further.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/26/apple-cuts-iphone-prices-in-india/">Apple Lowers iPhone Prices and Eyes iPad Assembly in India</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-lowers-iphone-prices-and-eyes-ipad-assembly-in-india.2432267/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has committed to a set of voluntary AI safeguards established by President Joe Biden's administration, joining other tech giants in a move to ensure responsible AI development (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-26/apple-to-adopt-voluntary-ai-safeguards-established-by-biden">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
Apple is now part of the a group of influential technology companies agreeing to the Biden administration's voluntary safeguards for artificial intelligence. The safeguards, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">announced by the White House</a> last year as part of an Executive Order, aim to guide the development of AI systems, ensuring they are tested for discriminatory tendencies, security vulnerabilities, and potential national security risks.<br/>
<br/>
The principles outlined in the guidelines call for companies to share the results of AI system tests with governments, civil society, and academia. This level of transparency is intended to foster an environment of accountability and peer review, promoting the development of safer and more reliable AI technologies. The safeguards Apple and other tech companies have agreed to also include commitments to test their AI systems for biases and security concerns. <br/>
<br/>
Although these guidelines are not legally binding, they signify a collective effort by the tech industry to self-regulate and mitigate the potential risks associated with AI technologies. The executive order signed by President Biden last year also requires AI systems to undergo testing before being eligible for federal procurement.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's participation in the initiative coincides with its plans to introduce its own cohesive AI system and deep integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Apple Intelligence will be supported by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, as well as all upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. For the Mac and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, all devices equipped with M-series Apple silicon chips will support Apple Intelligence. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple doesn't typically focus much on the Calculator app, but with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, it's getting a notable overhaul and some surprising integration with the Notes app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Calculator-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960038" /><br/>
This guide walks through everything that's new with the Calculator in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; (and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>).<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="math_notes">Math Notes</h2><br/>
The biggest change to the Calculator app is the addition of Math Notes, a feature that's basically an integration between the Calculator and the Notes app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-math-notes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960057" /><br/>
Math Notes lets you type equations in the Notes app and have them solved automatically when you put in an equals sign. So you can do things like calculate how much everyone owes for a group trip, or split up a dinner bill.<br/>
<br/>
You can do more complex equations too, defining variables and then using those definitions for your calculations. If you write dinner = &#36;57 and movies = &#36;24 in a note, for example, you can then type in "dinner + movies" and add an equals sign and get the total, with the Math Notes feature understanding what you're referencing.<br/>
<br/>
In Math Notes, your equations are solved automatically wherever you put in an equals sign, as that signals to Apple that you want to solve what you've typed.<br/>
<br/>
Math Notes is technically a Notes app feature, but you can in fact start a Math Note in the Calculator app, and use it right there without having to swap over to Notes.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open up the Calculator app.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on the calculator symbol at the bottom left of the app.</li><br/>
 <li>Select Math Notes.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on the new note symbol at the bottom right of the display.</li><br/>
 <li>Start your calculations.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
You can do this same thing directly in the Notes app with any existing or new note. It's all the same feature, just accessed from different places.<br/>
<br/>
If you're in a Math Note in the Calculator app and you want to get back to the standard calculator interface, just tap again on the calculator icon and choose the Basic or Scientific option.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that Math Notes is available for math written using Western Arabic numerals and common mathematical symbols, or typed using Arabic (Eastern &amp; Western) and Devanagari numerals and common mathematical symbols.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="math_notes_on_ipad">Math Notes on iPad</h2><br/>
With &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, Math Notes works in the same way, but there is an added bonus - you can use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>. Once you start a Math Note from the Calculator app or the Notes app, you can write your equations by hand and have them solved in the exact same way.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ipados-18-math-notes.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954476" /><br/>
<h2 id="math_notes_everywhere">Math Notes Everywhere</h2><br/>
You can in fact get Math Notes results almost anywhere in the operating system. If you type an equation into search, for example, you'll get a result, and the same goes for apps like Messages.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-math-notes-anywhere.jpg" alt="" width="2526" height="1421" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960058" /><br/>
<h2 id="unit_conversion">Unit Conversion</h2><br/>
When using Math Notes, you can do unit conversions. Just type in what you want to convert, and you'll get the result automatically. For example, if you type in 10 kilograms to pounds in the Math Notes interface in the Calculator app, the result is automatically generated.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-conversions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960059" /><br/>
Unit conversions work in search, Messages, Notes, the Calculator app, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="calculation_history">Calculation History</h2><br/>
If you open up the Calculator app and tap on the three lines at the upper left of the interface, you can see a history of all of the calculations you have entered into the app. Apple only saves calculations done with the Basic or Scientific calculators here, and Math Notes are saved in the Notes app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-history.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960060" /><br/>
You can long press on any of the calculations to copy either the expression or the result, and if you swipe, you can delete them from the list. You can also tap on the Edit button to select several expressions to delete, or use the Delete All option from this menu to clear out the app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="portrait_orientation">Portrait Orientation</h2><br/>
There is now an option to use the scientific calculator in portrait orientation, so you don't need to turn your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to landscape orientation to get to it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-scientific-calculator.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960061" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple rival <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-s-new-game-strategy-for-mobile-stores">today announced plans</a> to bring Fortnite to alternative app store AltStore in the European Union, which will mean the popular game will soon be available to download on iPhones and iPads.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite_apple_featured.jpg" alt="" width="2140" height="1204" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-754674" /><br/>
Created by developer Riley Testut, AltStore PAL was one of the first alternative app stores on iOS when it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/altstore-eu-alternative-app-marketplace/">launched back in April</a>. AltStore PAL is available in the European Union, where Apple supports sideloading to comply with Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
AltStore is an open-source app that distributes Testut's popular Delta game emulator as well as apps from other independent developers. Distributing apps through AltStore is free of charge, so &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; will not need to pay a fee to Testut, but Apple will collect an 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee (CTF) from &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; after Fortnite receives more than one million annual first installs.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who install AltStore must also pay 1.50 euros per year, a fee that is required because of Apple's CTF. Apple charges Testut 0.50 euros each time AltStore is installed.<br/>
<br/>
Along with bringing Fortnite to AltStore, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; said that it will bring Fortnite to other mobile stores that "give all developers a great deal," while also "ending distribution partnerships with mobile stores that serve as rent collectors." &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; said that it will be removing Fortnite and other Epic titles from the Samsung Galaxy Store to protest Samsung's "anticompetitive decision to block side-loading by default" on Samsung devices.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; also reiterated plans to bring its &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store to iOS in the European Union. Epic will charge a store fee of 12 percent for payments that it processes, and 0 percent on third-party payments.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortnite/">Fortnite</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/fortnite-altstore-eu/">Fortnite Coming to AltStore on iOS in European Union</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fortnite-coming-to-altstore-on-ios-in-european-union.2432235/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple says that the &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay service may be slow or unavailable.<br/>
<br/>

The outage started at 2:34 p.m. Eastern Time, but it does not appear to be affecting all &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; users. Some impacted users are unable to browse the web without turning &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay off, while others are seeing slow loading times. <br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/searchgpt-prototype/">today introduced SearchGPT</a>, a prototype of AI search features that are designed to provide "fast and timely answers" combined with "clear and relevant sources."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/open-ai-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1093" height="615" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953560" /><br/>
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/search">SearchGPT</a> is available to a small group of users and publishers at the current time, with OpenAI seeking feedback on the product. The prototype is temporary at the current time, but "best" of the features will be integrated into ChatGPT in the future.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI designed SearchGPT to pair conversational capabilities with real-time information with the web, which the company says can make it faster and easier to find what you're looking for. SearchGPT is able to respond to questions with up-to-date information from the web. SearchGPT is able to answer follow-up questions in a conversational manner, with shared context included with each additional query.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re testing SearchGPT, a temporary prototype of new AI search features that give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources. <br><br>We’re launching with a small group of users for feedback and plan to integrate the experience into ChatGPT. <a href="https://t.co/dRRnxXVlGh">https://t.co/dRRnxXVlGh</a> <a href="https://t.co/iQpADXmllH">pic.twitter.com/iQpADXmllH</a></p>&mdash; OpenAI (@OpenAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1816536290822881780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
OpenAI says that it is committed to a "thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators" and that it wants to help users discover publisher sites. Responses that SearchGPT provides have in-line, named attribution and links so users are aware where information is coming from, plus there's a sidebar with additional source links.<br/>
<br/>
Publishers are able to manage how they appear in SearchGPT, but OpenAI says that SearchGPT is "about search" and separate from training generative AI models. Sites can be surfaced in search results even if they've opted out of generative AI training.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Sonos CEO Patrick Spence <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/blog/update-on-the-sonos-app">today penned a blog post</a> on the Sonos website apologizing for the controversial Sonos app redesign and promising ongoing updates throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/sonos-redesigned-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947528" /><br/>
Spence said that improving the app for customers is the company's number one priority, and he explained that addressing bugs that came up in the new app delayed the introduction of additional features.<blockquote>We know that too many of you have experienced significant problems with our new app which rolled out on May 7, and I want to begin by personally apologizing for disappointing you. There isn't an employee at Sonos who isn't pained by having let you down, and I assure you that fixing the app for all of our customers and partners has been and continues to be our number one priority.</blockquote>Spence shared an outline of future feature plans, with Sonos planning to push updates on a bi-weekly basis. Alarms are set to be addressed in September, with edit mode for playlists and the queue coming in September or October.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>July and August:</strong><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Improving the stability when adding new products</li><br/>
 	<li>Implementing Music Library configuration, browse, search, and play</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<strong>August and September:</strong><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Improving Volume responsiveness</li><br/>
 	<li>User interface improvements based on customer feedback</li><br/>
 	<li>Improving overall system stability and error handling</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<strong>September:</strong><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Improving Alarm consistency and reliability</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<strong>September and October:</strong><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Restoring edit mode for Playlists and the Queue</li><br/>
 	<li>Improving functionality in settings</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Spence says that Sonos is working hard to earn back customer trust through the continual app improvements.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos in May <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/redesigned-sonos-app/">released its redesigned app</a> with customizable home screen and a more personalized listening service. Sonos customers quickly found that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/sonos-said-rolling-out-widely-criticized-app-redesign-took-courage/">app lacked several key features</a>, and suffered from multiple bugs. Complaints across social media called the app a "step back" for removing playlist management, alarms, and other features.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/sonos-app-update-apology/">Sonos Apologizes for Widely Criticized App Redesign, Provides Progress Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-apologizes-for-widely-criticized-app-redesign-provides-progress-update.2432227/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is set to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen, China, focusing on enhancing the quality and reliability of its flagship products (via <a href="https://x.com/szdaily1/status/1816308232463474990"><em>Shenzhen Daily</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/apple-china-iphone-factory.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-844992" /><br/>
<br/>
The new lab in Shenzhen is expected to boost Apple's research capabilities, focusing on reliability and quality testing for key products. The new facility will focus on testing new materials and production techniques, ensuring that products such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> can withstand extreme conditions, from intense physical activity to harsh temperatures. The lab's readiness comes at a crucial time as Apple ramps up production for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, which is widely expected to launch in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
The choice of Shenzhen is significant due to its proximity to many of Apple's suppliers. Apple first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-to-expand-research-facilities-in-china/">announced plans</a> for the new lab in March. Despite diversifying its production capacity to other countries like Vietnam and India, China remains a key manufacturing hub for Apple. The new Shenzhen facility is part of a broader expansion, which includes research and development centers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou. Apple has invested over 1 billion yuan (approximately &#36;138 million) in these facilities. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-23/apple-and-micron-leaders-visit-china-as-us-ramps-up-chip-curbs"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that Apple's Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Williams, recently visited Shenzhen to discuss investment and collaboration plans. He <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3271741/apple-coo-meets-shenzhen-official-discuss-supply-chain-ahead-iphone-16-launch">reportedly</a> emphasized the critical role Shenzhen plays in Apple's market strategy. Williams' visit to China also included meetings with senior Chinese officials in Beijing, a visit to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> in the Wangfujing shopping district, watching a film <a href="https://www.szdaily.com/content/2024-07/25/content_31105020.htm">shot on the iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, and a meeting with entertainment company Migu, which showcased its app developed for the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-williams/">Jeff Williams</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-research/">Apple Research</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/new-apple-lab-in-china-to-test-products/">New Apple Lab in China to Test Products Under Extreme Conditions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-lab-in-china-to-test-products-under-extreme-conditions.2432215/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Threads is currently rolling out a new way for users of its iOS app to create dedicated feeds based on search results, similar to how it works for Threads on the web.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/instagram-threads-app.jpg" alt="" width="1079" height="607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902359" /><br/>
When a search is performed, the new option in the app lets users bookmark the search, after which it lives on in the Home tab, alongside the For You and Following feeds.<br/>
<br/>
The feature has been available for a while on the Threads web view for desktop, where users could pin multiple customized columns, similar to the TweetDeck feature that used to be available on Twitter. The new addition for the iOS app is rolling out now, so you will probably want the latest app update installed so that you don't miss out when it arrives in your region.<br/>
<br/>
Threads has been around for over a year now. When it launched back in July 2023, the experience was very barebones, but Meta has worked to add new functionality on a regular basis to put the social network on a more level pegging with X (Twitter). <br/>

It has since gained a web app, the ability to search for posts chronologically, a post editing feature, built-in translation, fediverse integration, fast account switching, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you find yourself frequently scrolling through multiple Home Screen pages on your iPhone to get to the apps you access most often? If so, chances are you've already filled up the first page with some of your favorite apps. But what if you could automatically make all of your most-used apps appear on page one? With the Siri Suggestions widget, you can.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/siri-suggested-apps-iphone-home-screen.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959800" /><br/>
The Siri Suggestions widget intelligently recommends apps based on your usage patterns. By populating your Home Screen with multiple instances of this widget, you can ensure that the apps you need most are always just a tap away. Read on to learn how it's done.<br/>
<ol><br/>
    <li>With your iPhone unlocked, swipe to a Home Screen page with at least two free rows available.</li><br/>
    <li>Press and hold the empty space on the Home Screen until the apps start to jiggle.</li><br/>
    <li>Tap the "<strong>+</strong>" button in the top-left corner of the screen to access the widget gallery.</li><br/>
    <li>Search for "Siri Suggestions" in the widget gallery or scroll through the list to find it.</li><br/>
    <li>Tap the Siri Suggestions widget option, then choose the first option showing two rows of apps by tapping <strong>Add Widget</strong>.<br/>

    <li>Drag the widget to a fresh new page containing no other apps.</li><br/>
    <li>Add another instance of the Siri Suggestions widget by tapping the "+" button in the top-left corner of the screen again, then selecting it in the widget gallery, just like you did for the first one.</li><br/>
   <li>Add a third Siri Suggestions widget in the same way.<br/>

    <li>Next, tap the row of dots representing your ‌Home Screen‌ pages.</li><br/>
    <li>In the ‌Home Screen‌ grid that appears, touch and drag the page of widgets you just made and move it so that it's the first Home Screen page (the one you see when you unlock your iPhone). The others will move to make way in response to your drag action.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top-right corner of the screen when you're happy with the new arrangement, then tap <strong>Done</strong> again to exit jiggle mode.<br/>

That's all there is to it. By following the above steps, you will have quick access to your most-used apps, even if your habits change, ensuring your Home Screen is both dynamic and tailored to your needs.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/siri-suggested-apps-widget-home-screen/">Auto-Populate iPhone Home Screen With Your Most Used Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/auto-populate-iphone-home-screen-with-your-most-used-apps.2432201/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
