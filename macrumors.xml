		<description><![CDATA[Apple suppliers will begin production of two new fourth-generation AirPods models in May, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-17/apple-aapl-revamped-carplay-becomes-last-hope-after-apple-car-is-canceled-ltvif8zt"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Based on this production timeframe, he expects the headphones to be released in September or October.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/airpods-3-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893120" /><br/>
Gurman expects both fourth-generation AirPods models to feature a new design with better fit, improved sound quality, and an updated charging case with a USB-C port. The higher-end ones will also feature active noise cancellation and a speaker in the charging case that can play a sound for Find My location tracking, he said.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to discontinue the second-generation and third-generation AirPods after launching the two fourth-generation models, he previously said.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does not expect new AirPods Pro to launch until next year at the earliest, but he said the current models will get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/airpods-pro-to-gain-hearing-aid-mode-ios-18/">new hearing aid mode with iOS 18</a>. He added that Apple is also working on a hearing test feature for AirPods.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/17/airpods-4-production-and-launch-timing/">Two New AirPods 4 Models Expected to Launch in September or October</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-new-airpods-4-models-expected-to-launch-in-september-or-october.2422158/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>MacRumors</em> was first to report that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-id-to-apple-account-rebrand/">planning to rebrand "Apple ID" to "Apple Account"</a> across its software platforms and websites like iCloud.com as early as this year, and now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-17/apple-aapl-revamped-carplay-becomes-last-hope-after-apple-car-is-canceled-ltvif8zt"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> has corroborated this change.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17-Passkey-With-Apple-ACCOUNT-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941734" /><em>A mockup of the new Apple Account branding</em></div><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-17/apple-aapl-revamped-carplay-becomes-last-hope-after-apple-car-is-canceled-ltvif8zt"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said the new "Apple Account" branding will start to be used later this year both online and in Apple's next major software releases, such as iOS 18 for the iPhone and watchOS 11 for the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already refers to funds added to an Apple ID as an "<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208687">Apple Account balance</a>," and Gurman said there is an "Apple Account" team within the company. With the full rebranding later this year, the term Apple ID is expected to be completely phased out, over two decades after the company started using it. Apple's reasoning behind the decision is not known, but "Apple Account" would be more straightforward branding.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will preview iOS 18 and its other major software updates at its developers conference WWDC in June, and the rebranding to "Apple Account" will likely be announced then. The updates should be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/17/apple-id-rebrand-to-apple-account-ios-18/">&#039;Apple ID&#039; Expected to Change to &#039;Apple Account&#039; Starting With iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-id-expected-to-change-to-apple-account-starting-with-ios-18.2422155/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's relocated store at the Square One shopping mall in Mississauga, Ontario will hold its grand opening on Saturday, March 23 at 10 a.m. local time, according to updated wording on the store's construction facade, shared with us  <a href="https://twitter.com/ApolloZhaoD/status/1769095750946865601">by Apollo Zhao</a>. Mississauga is located just west of Toronto, the most populous city in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Square-One-New.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941679" /><em>The new Apple Square One (via <a href="https://twitter.com/ApolloZhaoD/status/1769095750946865601">Apollo Zhao</a>)</em></div><br/>
Thursday, March 21 <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/squareone/">will be the final day of business</a> at Apple's existing Square One store, which originally opened in August 2009.<br/>
<br/>
The new store is located on the second floor of Square One, above the central food court, and it has a very wide, partially-curved facade. It has a significantly larger footprint than the existing store, which will allow it to better accommodate the heavy customer traffic at Canada's second-largest indoor shopping mall.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Oracle this week warned that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-4/">macOS 14.4 update</a> released earlier this month for Macs can cause Java processes to "terminate unexpectedly."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-feature-purple-green.jpg" alt="" width="2585" height="1454" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898568" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/java-on-macos-14-4">blog post</a> on Friday, Oracle's Senior Director of Product Management Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro recommended that Apple silicon Mac users who rely on Java avoid updating to macOS 14.4 until the issue is resolved by Apple:<blockquote>An issue introduced by macOS 14.4, which causes Java process[es] to terminate unexpectedly, is affecting all Java versions from Java 8 to the early access builds of JDK 22. There is no workaround available, and since there is no easy way to revert a macOS update, affected users might be unable to return to a stable configuration unless they have a complete backup of their systems prior to the OS update.</blockquote>The blog post and <a href="https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=8327860">bug report</a> include more technical details about the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Oracle says it has notified Apple about the issue. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment about the matter.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After over a year of reports, there are now more than a dozen specific rumors about the features and improvements set to be offered by the two non-Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models later in 2024. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-14-vs-16-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-941488" /></div><br/>
While the upgrades that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; offers over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> will likely be at the center of Apple's marketing strategy later this year, many users are on two-year upgrade cycles, so the features introduced on both the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will stack up. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their two direct forerunners are listed below, using information from a range of reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
This guide focuses on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but to learn about how we are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro to improve on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">see our other comparison article</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to largely carry over the design of their predecessors. As a result, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will be a relatively significant evolution over the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌, featuring slightly rounded edges, a frosted glass back, and a vertical rear camera arrangement to facilitate spatial video capture. Other important design changes are expected to include the removal of the mute switch in favor of the Action button introduced on last year's Pro models and the introduction of an all-new "Capture" button.<br/>

With the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models rumored to receive the same A18 chip as the Pro models, the new models could offer a major performance improvement over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, which features the A15 Bionic chip first introduced in 2021. The 2GB of additional memory and the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip are also due to be notable upgrades. <br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models could receive some major improvements in battery technology and charging, sporting denser batteries and faster charging capabilities. It is worth noting that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus is rumored to feature a smaller battery than its predecessors, but it is not clear how this will affect actual battery life. <br/>

While many of Apple's devices are rumored to receive a series of new AI-based features via software updates later this year, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to take these further with exclusive capabilities facilitated by a more powerful Neural Engine in the A18 chip and an upgraded microphone.<br/>

<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ in 2023, introducing a more modern design with the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, a USB-C port, and q 48-megapixel camera. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will build on these upgrades, offering the Capture and Action buttons, AI features, and spatial video capture. With over 30 upgrades rumored to be in store, many ‌current &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ users will find upgrading to an ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; model worthwhile, if not essential.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to launch in the fall. Apple usually hosts an event every September to unveil new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, with launch following just over a week later.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple news and rumors settled down a bit this week following the launch of the M3 MacBook Air, but there was still plenty to talk about including Apple's ongoing changes to satisfy the EU's Digital Markets Act and signs of an upcoming iOS update likely to address some bugs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/top-stories-16mar2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941512" /><br/>
We're also looking forward to new iPad Pro and iPad Air models coming in the next few weeks or so, plus the iPhone 16 lineup later this year, so read on for the latest on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces Ability to Download iPhone Apps From Websites in EU</h2><br/>
Apple this week announced that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">iPhone users in the EU will soon be able to download apps directly from the websites</a> of eligible developers. Apple says web distribution will be available in a software update that will be released "later this spring," which likely refers to iOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933094" /><br/>
Apple already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">added support for alternative app marketplaces</a> on the iPhone in the EU with iOS 17.4, released earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
These changes are a result of the EU's Digital Markets Act, which Apple has strongly opposed but reluctantly complied with.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Preparing iOS 17.4.1 Update for iPhone</h2><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-preparing-ios-17-4-1/">internally testing iOS 17.4.1 for the iPhone</a>, based on evidence of the software update in our website's logs this week. It is unclear exactly when the update will be released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.4.1-Feature-Joe-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940545" /><br/>
Our logs have revealed the existence of several iOS 17 versions before Apple released them, ranging from iOS 17.0.3 to iOS 17.3.1. iOS 17.4.1 should be a minor update that addresses software bugs and/or security vulnerabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>2024 iPad Pro: Key Rumors to Be Aware of Ahead of Announcement</h2><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects new iPad Pro and iPad Air models to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/">released towards the "end of March" or in April</a>. He also expects new Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories to be released for iPads simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
We have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/2024-ipad-pro-key-rumors/">recapped key rumors about the 2024 iPad Pro models</a> ahead of the devices being announced, so be sure to check out our list of expected features and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Video Comparison: M3 MacBook Air vs. M3 MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Earlier this month, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">updated the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air</a> with its latest-generation M3 chip, Wi-Fi 6E support, and compatibility with two external displays when the laptop's lid is closed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-Pro-vs.-M3-Air-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940924" /><br/>
In a recent video on our YouTube channel, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/m3-macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro/">compared the new MacBook Air with the base model 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip</a>.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Everything We Know About Apple's Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
It has been nearly two years since Apple first previewed next-generation CarPlay at WWDC 2022, and it has still yet to become available in any vehicles. In an article this week, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/apple-next-generation-carplay-recap/">recapped the latest information about the upcoming software system</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/next-generation-carplay-multi-display.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848463" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/apple-next-generation-carplay-recap/">Next-generation CarPlay</a> will have deeper integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, climate controls, FM radio, and more. It will also support multiple displays across the dashboard, and offer a variety of personalization options.<br/>

Best Buy's price drop comes just hours after Walmart <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/walmart-selling-macbook-air-with-m1-chip/">started selling</a> the M1 MacBook Air for &#36;699.<br/>

<br/>
Just after Apple announced the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models, Best Buy started selling the M1 MacBook Air for &#36;750, so the price has come down &#36;100 in the last 10 days. The model that Best Buy has for &#36;649.99 is the entry-level version with 8GB Unified Memory, an 8-core CPU, a 7-core GPU, and a 256GB SSD.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clLm50orOos"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;350 OFF</div>13-inch M1 MacBook Air for &#36;649.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple discontinued the M1 MacBook Air on March 4, which is why we're seeing such low prices on remaining inventory. The M1 MacBook Air first came out in 2020, so it is four years old at this point, but the Apple silicon chip is still more than adequate for day-to-day tasks. <a href="https://howl.me/clLm50orOos">&#36;649 is a great price</a> for those who want to get an Apple silicon Mac while also saving some cash.<br/>
<br/>
As the M1 MacBook Air is no longer being manufactured, available supply is likely to dry up soon.

As noted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/15/apple-gives-users-a-new-way-to-browse-vision-pros-app-store/">9to5Mac</a></em>, Vision Pro apps can be viewed by going to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/vision">Apple Vision Pro web page</a>. Apple has dedicated sections for apps and games, along with a separate tab for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> games that can be used on Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Apps are organized into the same categories that are available on the Vision Pro, such as What's New, Hot This Week, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> Games for Vision Pro, and Don't Miss. Apps can also be viewed by type, with Apple organizing them into options like Weather, Utility, Entertainment, Sports, Productivity, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The option to view available Vision Pro apps gives those without the headset a central location to check out the available software before deciding whether to make a purchase. Vision Pro apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-vision-pro-apps-app-store-website/">have been listed individually</a> on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; website since launch, but until now, there was no way to get an overview of all available content except on the Vision Pro itself.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/visionos-app-store-web/">You Can Now Browse Vision Pro Apps on the Web</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-now-browse-vision-pro-apps-on-the-web.2422048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is Apple's top-selling product, and it gets an update every year. In 2024, we're expecting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> lineup, with an arguably more interesting feature set than we got with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFircs10BaA" title="iPhone 16: 5 Key New Features!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
<h2>Capture Button</h2><br/>
All four &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are set to get a whole new button, which will be located on the right side of the device below the Power button. In the United States, this is where the mmWave 5G antenna is, so Apple will be shifting that over to the other side.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Perspective-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935281" /><br/>
This addition, which Apple calls the "Capture Button," will be for taking photos and videos when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is held in a landscape orientation. It seems aimed specifically at capturing 3D landscape video that will then be viewed on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, but it will also be useful for taking regular video and photos as well.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest the button will be a standard mechanical button like the Power and Volume buttons, but it will support multiple levels of pressure. You'll be able to press down lightly to focus, and then press down further to snap a picture or start recording. The feel will be similar to a multi-function camera shutter button.<br/>
<br/>
As a bonus, the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will also get the Action Button that was introduced with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, so both the Action Button and Capture Button will be available across the entire lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Display Sizes</h2><br/>
Apple has been using 6.1 and 6.7-inch display sizes for all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; generations since the 2020 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 models, but display sizes are finally set to increase slightly in 2024. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; display is expected to be approximately 6.3 inches, while the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max display will be approximately 6.9 inches.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928695" /><br/>
Screen sizes are bigger because the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and 16 Pro Max will be about 3mm taller, and around 1mm wider. Thickness isn't increasing, but weight will go up just a bit because of size jump.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the size change will be limited to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max this year, and the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 16 Plus will still measure in at 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Camera Upgrades</h2><br/>
Apple has camera changes in store for all of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models. For the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, there will be a new vertical lens arrangement that does away with the diagonal arrangement Apple has used for the last several years. The change is expected to let the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models capture spatial video, a feature limited to the 15 Pro and Pro Max right now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Colors.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935159" /><br/>
The biggest update will be limited to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, though. Apple is upgrading the Ultra Wide camera to 48 megapixels, bringing improved images in lower lighting conditions. The lens is expected to work like the 48-megapixel Wide camera, which uses pixel binning to combine the data from four pixels into one "super pixel" for better image quality.<br/>
<br/>
Since spatial video recording uses both the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras, spatial videos will get a boost with the new Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also going to bring the 5x Telephoto lens to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; this year, and that's presumably possible because of those aforementioned size increases. 5X optical zoom is available on the 15 Pro Max right now, but both Pro models will get it in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Faster 5G</h2><br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, Apple plans to adopt Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X75 modem chip. Modem chips aren't often a major feature that we highlight, especially since the transition to 5G, but the X75 will be faster while also using less power.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/qualcomm-x75-chip.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941580" /><br/>
It offers 10-carrier aggregation for mmWave and 5x carrier aggregation for sub-6GHz. Carrier aggregation improves data speeds, so a higher number equates to lower latency and more data throughput. The modem chip has a second-generation AI processor inside that Qualcomm says will improve speeds, coverage, link robustness, and location accuracy. You might see fewer connection issues in parking garages, elevators, and subways.<br/>
<br/>
The X75 merges the sub-6GHz and mmWave transceivers, so there's 25 percent less circuit board space used and less power draw. So far, rumors suggest that the X75 will be limited to the Pro models in 2024, with the standard models to continue to use the X70 in the current &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
Along with better 5G, Apple could also bring Wi-Fi 7 to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models. Wi-Fi 7 supports speeds up to 40Gb/s, and could result in lower latency and more reliable connectivity. As for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, we're expecting to see an upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E, allowing them to connect to 6GHz networks. The 15 Pro models support Wi-Fi 6E, but the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are limited to Wi-Fi 6.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Generative AI</h2><br/>
Apple is focusing on AI in a big way in 2024 as it aims to catch up with Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and other companies that have invested heavily in generative AI. AI is software based, of course, but it needs hardware to support it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is rumored to be making some major AI-based improvements and introducing AI across the operating system, and some of the most advanced features might be limited to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup because of the processing power required.<br/>
<br/>
All four &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to get an A18 chip (perhaps A18 Pro for the Pro lineup), and the A18 chips will be built on Apple's 3-nanometer process for improved performance and efficiency. Right now, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> A17 Pro, but the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are using prior-generation A16 chip technology.<br/>
<br/>
Upgrading to a 3-nanometer chip across the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup will allow Apple to bring the latest AI features to even its most affordable flagship models, and the A18 is expected to include a faster Neural Engine with "significantly" more cores. Rumors suggest that Apple wants to do AI processing on-device to preserve privacy, and some serious performance is needed to make that possible.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's long-running <a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks">butterfly keyboard service program</a> for MacBooks is ending soon, with only a few models still eligible for a free repair.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/MacBook-Keyboard-Close.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941611" /><br/>
Below, we take a look back at Apple's butterfly keyboard problems that led to the program.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Butterfly Keyboard</h2><br/>
For much of the 2000s, MacBook keyboards had a traditional scissor switch mechanism. That changed in March 2015, when Apple released an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/09/apple-new-macbook-2015/">ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook</a> with a low-profile keyboard that used a new butterfly switch mechanism. While the keyboard fit in the 12-inch MacBook's thin enclosure, it is prone to issues, such as letters repeating unexpectedly or failing to appear when keys are pressed.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-vs-scissor-keyboard/">Apple's Butterfly Keyboards vs. Scissor Switch Keyboards</a></li></ul><br/>
It was not until Apple updated the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with its second-generation butterfly keyboard in October 2016 that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/21/2016-macbook-pro-keyboard-issues/">customers began to complain</a> about sticky and unresponsive keys in earnest. Apple expanded the butterfly keyboard to the MacBook Air a few years later, leading to even more complaints.<br/>
<br/>
The situation came to a head in May 2018, when Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/05/14/macbook-pro-keyboard-class-action-lawsuit/">hit with a class action lawsuit</a> in the U.S. alleging that the company knew the butterfly keyboard was defective. An online <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-apple-recall-macbook-pro-w-defective-keyboard-replace-with-different-working-keyboard">petition about the issues</a> that year gained nearly 43,000 signatures.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Program</h2><br/>
In June 2018, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/22/apple-macbook-pro-keyboard-repair-program/">launched a "Keyboard Service Program"</a> worldwide after it determined that a "small percentage" of keyboards in certain MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro models may exhibit one or more of the following behaviors:<ul><li>Letters or characters repeat unexpectedly</li><br/>
<li>Letters or characters do not appear</li><br/>
<li>Key(s) feel "sticky" or do not respond in a consistent manner</li></ul>Apple and Apple Authorized Service Providers have been repairing eligible MacBook keyboards, free of charge, for up to four years after the first retail sale of the affected laptop. That window is nearly over, as all eligible models except the two 2019 versions of the 13-inch MacBook Pro were discontinued more than four years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/ifixit-butterfly-keyboard-mac.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-823726" /><em>The butterfly switch mechanism for a 2018 MacBook Pro keyboard (iFixit)</em></div><br/>
The list of all models that were eligible:<ul><li>MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, Early 2015)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook (Retina, 12­-inch, Early 2016)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, 2017)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2019)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13­-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2016)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2017)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2018)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2019)</li></ul>Apple discontinued the 2019 model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro in November 2020, so some customers who own that laptop may still be eligible for a free keyboard repair until as late as November 2024, depending on when they purchased it. After that, the service program will be completely over, unless it is extended by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Apology</h2><br/>
In March 2019, Apple finally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/27/apple-apologizes-about-third-gen-keyboard-issues/">apologized about the keyboards</a>.<br/>
<br/>
"We are aware that a small number of users are having issues with their third-generation butterfly keyboard and for that we are sorry," an Apple spokesperson said, in a statement shared with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern. "The vast majority of Mac notebook customers are having a positive experience with the new keyboard."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Fix</h2><br/>
Starting with the 16-inch MacBook Pro in November 2019, Apple ditched the butterfly keyboard and returned to using a scissor switch mechanism. The change was extended to the MacBook Air in March 2020, and to the 13-inch MacBook Pro in May 2020, marking the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/04/rip-butterfly-keyboard/">end of the problematic butterfly keyboard era</a> for the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Settlement</h2><br/>
In July 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/29/apple-butterfly-keyboard-settlement-approval/">agreed to pay &#36;50 million</a> to settle the U.S. class action lawsuit related to the butterfly keyboard issues. Affected customers who submitted a valid claim <a href="https://www.keyboardsettlement.com/">by the March 2023 deadline</a> will receive a payment of between &#36;50 and &#36;395.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/">Butterfly Keyboard Issues</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/apple-butterfly-keyboard-program-nearly-over/">Apple&#039;s Butterfly Keyboard Repair Program for MacBooks is Nearly Over</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-butterfly-keyboard-repair-program-for-macbooks-is-nearly-over.2422033/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Astropad is known for <a href="https://astropad.com/product/studio?sca_ref=5507981.N2my3G8kPZ">the Astropad Studio app</a> that turns the iPad into a drawing tablet for a Mac, but also for the <a href="https://astropad.com/product/rock-paper-pencil?sca_ref=5507981.N2my3G8kPZ">Rock Paper Pencil</a> and <a href="https://astropad.com/darkboard?sca_ref=5507981.N2my3G8kPZ">Darkboard iPad Stand</a>, both of which are perfect for getting more out of Apple's iPads.<br/>
<br/>

Rock Paper Pencil is a kit that includes a textured screen protector and Apple Pencil tip that combine to make writing and drawing on the iPad feel like you're writing on a piece of paper. Astropad just recently overhauled the Rock Paper Pencil to make it an even better experience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/rock-paper-pencil-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941501" /><br/>
The screen protector uses NanoCling technology so it adheres to an iPad using static cling, and it can be taken off and put back on as needed with no residue left on the iPad's screen. With NanoCling, the screen protector fits right up to the display of the iPad to provide a flat surface with no gaps or ridges. Because of the slight friction from the texture of the screen protector, there's more control over stroke output.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/rock-paper-pencil-3.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941502" /><br/>
Rock Paper Pencil's pencil tip fits on to the Apple Pencil and can hold up to heavy daily use. There's a wear-resistant copper alloy core inside with a palladium coating, and it is equivalent to an 0.7mm ballpoint pen for precision writing and sketching. Astropad includes two pencil tips with the kit, along with a protective storage sleeve so you can tuck away the screen protector when you're not using it.<br/>
<br/>

Priced at &#36;40, the <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/rock-paper-pencil?sca_ref=5507981.N2my3G8kPZ">Rock Paper Pencil kit</a> works with all of Apple's modern iPads, including the iPad Air, both iPad Pro models, the sixth-generation iPad mini, and the 7th-generation and later iPad.<br/>
<br/>
For those who like to sketch and draw on their iPads, Astropad also makes the <a href="https://astropad.com/darkboard?sca_ref=5507981.N2my3G8kPZ">Darkboard Drawing Stand</a>, an essential accessory for improving iPad ergonomics for artists. Made from a rigid foam material, the Darkboard can be used on the couch, in bed, or on a flat surface without causing stress on the arms and wrists.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/darkboard.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-865370" /><br/>
The foam material provides cushioning, and a polycarbonate frame holds the iPad in place at any angle so you can get comfortable positioning no matter where you're at. If you have a desk or a table for Darkboard, it can be used vertically to turn the iPad into a mini Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Astropad designed Darkboard with 1mm of space between the iPad's display and the foam for device protection in case the Darkboard is dropped, and it leaves a cutout for the camera and charging port so you're not losing any functionality. There's also a little pocket for storing the Apple Pencil when it's not in use, and grooved handles so it can be moved from place to place.<br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/darkboard?sca_ref=5507981.N2my3G8kPZ">Priced at &#36;100</a>, Darkboard works with the 11-inch iPad Pro, third-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro and later, and the 10.9-inch iPad Air.<br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oa3GY7loQgc?si=5YXyvajFomK3tqF6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is rumored to feature the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/">redesigned rear camera</a>, and specification upgrades like Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. Most significantly, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is expected to come in two sizes for the first time, just like the Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and MacBook Pro. One of the size options will be the same as the previous two generations at 10.9-inches, while the new addition to the lineup will mirror the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s 12.9-inch model. The new devices should be announced alongside new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models in late March or April. We also discuss <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> workflows, the new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, and the positioning of each of the models in the current &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has agreed to pay &#36;490 million to settle a class action lawsuit alleging that Apple CEO Tim Cook defrauded shareholders by concealing falling demand for iPhones in China, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-reaches-490-million-settlement-with-shareholders-over-china-sales-comments-2024-03-15/">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>, which cited a court filing today. The proposed settlement requires approval by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in California.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Tim-Cook-iPhone-11-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941472" /><br/>
On a November 1, 2018 earnings call with analysts, Cook <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4217359-apple-aapl-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript">said</a> Apple was facing pressure in emerging markets where local currencies were weakening, such as Turkey, India, Brazil, and Russia, but he did not include China in the list:<blockquote>The emerging markets that we're seeing pressure in are markets like Turkey, India, Brazil, Russia. These are markets where currencies have weakened over the recent period. In some cases, that resulted in us raising prices and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see.</blockquote>Cook went on to say the following about China on the call:<blockquote>In relation to China specifically, I would not put China in that category. Our business in China was very strong last quarter. We grew 16%, which we're very happy with. iPhone in particular was very strong, very strong double-digit growth there. Our other products category was also stronger, in fact, a bit stronger than even the overall company number.</blockquote>A few months later, in January 2019, Cook <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/02/apple-lowers-q1-2019-revenue-guidance/">shared</a> a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">letter to investors</a> indicating that Apple's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 would be around &#36;84 billion, lower than its original guidance of between &#36;89 billion and &#36;93 billion in the quarter. Apple ended up reporting revenue of &#36;84.3 billion in the quarter on January 29, 2019.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's share price dropped around 25% between November 1, 2018 and January 31, 2019.<br/>
<br/>
In his letter, Cook said the Greater China region's slowing economy was largely to blame for Apple's revenue shortfall in the quarter:<blockquote>While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.</blockquote>The letter added that lower-than-anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounted for the entire revenue shortfall:<blockquote>Lower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline.</blockquote>Investors alleged that Cook knew that iPhone demand was falling in China at the time of the November 2018 earnings call, but failed to disclose it. Apple has denied these allegations and has not admitted to any wrongdoing. Apple only agreed to the proposed settlement to avoid additional costs and time involved with litigation, the filing says.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/apple-agrees-to-settle-tim-cook-investor-lawsuit/">Apple Agrees to Pay &#36;490M to Settle Lawsuit Alleging That Tim Cook Defrauded Shareholders</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-agrees-to-pay-490m-to-settle-lawsuit-alleging-that-tim-cook-defrauded-shareholders.2422004/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://tiptop.com">TipTop</a>, an app for trading in used devices and getting instant cash, today launched a new feature called Shop. With TipTop Shop, users are able to buy new, open box, and refurbished items, while also trading in old devices at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/tiptop-shop.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941330" /><br/>
The feature allows customers to sell items, trade them in, and/or buy new devices in a single transaction. It is a unique option for a trade-in/device selling app, as there is no need for a multi-step process when upgrading to a new device.<br/>
<blockquote>Now, with TipTop Shop you can purchase any item and, at the same time, trade in any device from any manufacturer. Cross brand trade-in is an industry first, as other trade-in programs rely on multiple step transactions, gift cards or other complicated arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
Want to trade in your Samsung Galaxy for a new iPad? No problem. An Apple HomePod mini for a solid discount on the new Nintendo Switch? You bet. Trading in your iPhone for a Nothing Phone? We can help with that. And TipTop can do it all in one tap.</blockquote><br/>
TipTop was founded by Bastian Lehmann, the founder and CEO of Postmates, and its marketing VP is former <em>TechCrunch</em> editor-in-chief Matthew Panzarino.  The app's trade-in prices are similar to the prices offered by Apple, though it offers more than Apple on some newer devices and less than Apple on older devices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://caviar.global/">Caviar</a>, a company known for making luxury variants of popular tech gadgets, intends to release a <a href="https://caviar.global/catalog/virtual-reality/">custom Apple Vision Pro</a> plated with 18-karat gold next year that will inevitably set you back more than Apple's &#36;3,499 starting price.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/caviar-vision-pro2.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="770" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941413" /><br/>
The device's headband is made from Connolly leather, and  features a gold visor cover attachment inspired by "Tom Ford flip-up glasses and Gucci ski masks."<br/>
<br/>
"Judging by the public's reaction, not everyone appreciates having their eyes displayed on the external screen. With Caviar's version, you can preserve your privacy if you wish," says the company.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Vision Pro CVR Edition by Caviar will be a limited edition release of 24 units, with an estimated early 2025 launch. The starting price is "available on request," according to the website, but elsewhere the device is advertised for around &#36;40,000. <br/>
<br/>
Caviar also recently listed a <a href="https://caviar.global/collections/future/models/vision_id28461/">custom iPhone 15 Pro</a> that has been modified to match the look of the Vision Pro. That costs a mere &#36;8,060 and can be pre-ordered today from the Caviar website.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/caviar/">Caviar</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/caviar-apple-vision-pro-custom-gold/">Caviar&#039;s 18-Karat Gold Custom Apple Vision Pro Won&#039;t Start at &#36;3,499</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/caviars-18-karat-gold-custom-apple-vision-pro-wont-start-at-3-499.2421998/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The laptop can be <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889">ordered now on Walmart.com</a>, and it will be available soon at select Walmart stores.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Walmart-MacBook-Air-M1.jpg" alt="" width="987" height="555" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941402" /><br/>
This is the first time that customers can purchase a Mac that is sold directly by Walmart, the company said in a press release. Some other retailers like Amazon and Best Buy have previously offered this model for as low as &#36;749.99.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first released the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020, as one of the first Macs with an Apple silicon chip instead of an Intel processor. The configuration being sold for &#36;699 includes the M1 chip, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM/unified memory, with Gold, Silver, and Space Gray color options available. Walmart's product listing says the MacBook Air is in brand new condition, so this is not a used/refurbished model.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-discontinues-m1-macbook-air/">discontinued the MacBook Air with the M1 chip</a> earlier this month, following the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">new MacBook Air models with its latest-generation M3 chip</a>. Prior to being discontinued, the model was being sold for &#36;999 brand new. Apple continues to sell refurbished MacBook Air models with the M1 chip, with pricing starting at &#36;759.<br/>

While the MacBook Air with the M1 chip is around three and a half years old, it is still a very capable machine for many average day-to-day tasks. However, it has an older design and has fewer remaining years of macOS compatibility than the latest MacBook Air models, so those aspects should be factored into your purchasing decision.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/walmart/">Walmart</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/walmart-selling-macbook-air-with-m1-chip/">Walmart Begins Selling MacBook Air With M1 Chip for &#36;699 in U.S.</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/walmart-begins-selling-macbook-air-with-m1-chip-for-699-in-u-s.2421995/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that Apple's Vision Pro spatial computing headset has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-launch-day/">launched</a> in the United States, when will it become available to buy in other countries? Here's what we know.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929939" /><br/>
Officially, Apple has said that following the U.S. launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> on February 2, 2024, the device will be coming to more countries later in the year, though the company has so far stopped short of officially revealing which countries and when exactly.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, that's not the final word on the subject. According to insider sources at Apple cited by well-connected <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/gurman-vision-pro-launch-imminent/"><em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman</a>, the launch of Vision Pro in other countries around the world will not "actually be that much later" than its release in the United States. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is discussing the United Kingdom and Canada as two of the first international markets to get the mixed reality headset by the end of 2024, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/apple-vision-pro-launch-uk-canada-end-of-2024/">according to Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, Apple is said to be looking at bringing the Vision Pro to the rest of Europe as well as Asia, with Apple engineers working to localize the device for France, Germany, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea.<br/>
<br/>
More recently, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/vision-pro-keyboard-new-languages/">code discovered by <em>MacRumors</em></a> suggests Apple will soon add 12 new languages to the virtual keyboard on the Vision Pro. Right now, the device's virtual keyboard only supports English (US), which makes sense given that it is only available in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
To bring the Vision Pro to new countries, Apple needs to add support for additional languages. The code indicates the following languages will be added:<br/>
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;"><ul><br/>
 <li>Cantonese, Traditional</li><br/>
 <li>Chinese, Simplified</li><br/>
 <li>English (Australia)</li><br/>
 <li>English (Canada)</li><br/>
 <li>English (Japan)</li><br/>
 <li>English (Singapore)</li></ul></div><div style="float: right; width: 50%;"><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>English (UK)</li><br/>
 <li>French (Canada)</li><br/>
 <li>French (France)</li><br/>
 <li>German (Germany)</li><br/>
 <li>Japanese</li><br/>
 <li>Korean</li><br/>
</ul></div><br/>
<div style="clear:both;"></div><br/>
It's likely that these language additions hint at the countries where Apple will launch the Vision Pro next, including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the UK. Hong Kong and Taiwan are also potential candidates.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="international_launch_in_first_half_of_2024">International Launch in First Half of 2024?</h2><br/>
Separately, well-regarded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> claims that Apple will likely launch its Vision Pro headset outside the United States before Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2024. Kuo bases his prediction on information that suggests Apple plans to share new details about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> – the device's operating system – with developers around the globe at its upcoming developers conference.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo explained that Apple's reasoning for keeping sales of the Vision Pro exclusive to the United States at first is due to limited supply, a wish to ensure that the sales process goes smoothly before expanding it, and to provide time to modify its software to be suitable for other countries. Once these issues have been resolved, Kuo believes the Vision Pro will go on sale in more countries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not anticipate partnering with third-party resellers to offer the Vision Pro until at least 2025, due to the complex supply chain logistics and staff training involved in handling the device and advising customers, according to Gurman.<br/>
