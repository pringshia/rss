		<description><![CDATA[Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg today compared the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> to the &#36;500 Meta Quest 3 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3TkhmivNzt/">in an Instagram video</a>, and provided several reasons why he thinks Meta's headset is better than Apple's.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg" alt="" width="1385" height="779" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914163" /><br/>
According to Zuckerberg, the Quest 3 is better "for the vast majority of things that people use mixed reality for," and here are some of the things he said about the Meta Quest 3:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>It's 7x less expensive than Vision Pro.</li><br/>
 	<li>It does high-quality passthrough with big screens "just like Vision Pro."</li><br/>
 	<li>Quest is a lot more comfortable - it's 120 grams less.</li><br/>
 	<li>There are no wires that get in the way when you move around.</li><br/>
 	<li>The field of view is wider and the screen is brighter.</li><br/>
 	<li>Vision Pro has motion blur when you move around. Quest is a lot crisper.</li><br/>
 	<li>Precision controllers are available, as is hand tracking, and Quest's hand tracking is more accurate.</li><br/>
 	<li>Quest's immersive content library is a lot deeper.</li><br/>
 	<li>You can watch YouTube or play Xbox.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Zuckerberg said that he was surprised at the "tradeoffs" that Apple had to make to provide a higher resolution screen than is offered by the Quest 3, sacrificing "comfort," "ergonomics," and more. He went on to explain that Apple is not always the leader in a new product category, and that he hopes Meta's devices will ultimately "win."<blockquote>Now look, I know that some fanboys get upset whenever somebody dares to question if Apple is going to be the leader in a new category, but the reality is that every generation of computing has an open and a closed model. And yeah, in mobile, Apple's closed model won. It's not always that way. If you go back to the PC era, Microsoft's open model was the winner. In this next generation, Meta is going to be the open model, and I really want to make sure that the open model wins out again. The future is not yet written.</blockquote>The Meta Quest 3 launched back in October. It has two 2K LCD panels compared to the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;'s 4K microLED displays. It weighs 515 grams while the Vision Pro weighs 600 to 650 grams, and it does not have a separate battery pack. It uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, has 8GB RAM, and is equipped with Touch Plus controllers.<br/>
<br/>
Meta has produced several headsets so far, including the Oculus Quest, the Oculus Quest 2, the Quest 3, and the Quest Pro. Apple plans to continue producing headsets, and rumors suggest that the next-generation version will be much more affordable. When explaining the price of the Vision Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/tim-cook-on-vision-pro-moment/">Apple CEO Tim Cook said</a> that it was "tomorrow's technology today."<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Says Quest 3 is Better Than Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-says-quest-3-is-better-than-apple-vision-pro.2419400/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A vision testing app named "Kimi" with a not-so-hidden pirated movie feature recently made its way past Apple's review team, ultimately reaching number eight on the list of top free entertainment apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/kimi-app.jpg" alt="" width="3291" height="1851" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936299" /><br/>
As reported by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/13/24071693/kimi-movie-piracy-app-store-trending-apple-iphone-ios">The Verge</a></em>, Kimi's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> listing claimed that it was an app that "tests your eyesight," but when downloaded and installed, it opened right up to a clear TV show and movie interface for downloading and watching pirated content. There was no attempt to hide the app's true purpose behind some kind of vision test interface, which begs the question of how it made its way past the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; review team.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; description mentioned comparing two pictures as an eyesight test, watching scenery, and playing games, but none of those features were present in the app.<br/>
<br/>
For an app focused on pirated content, Kimi had a fleshed out feature set. It offered top movies, search options, recommended suggestions, games, and more, with ads included for monetization purposes. The app was first approved in September, and it was available for several months in the iOS and macOS App Stores without Apple noticing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple pulled the app this morning after <em>The Verge</em> wrote about it, and it is no longer available.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second time in the last week that Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; has made headlines for questionable app approval. Last Thursday, popular password management app LastPass raised the alarm about a fake "LassPass" app that was imitating its design and feature set. Apple pulled the app about a day after the news was shared on media sites.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/pirated-movie-was-in-app-store/">Pirated Movie App Disguised as Vision Test Snuck Onto App Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pirated-movie-app-disguised-as-vision-test-snuck-onto-app-store.2419391/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are more than 1,000 apps available for the Vision Pro, Apple marketing chief Greg Joswiak said today. There are also more than 1.5 million <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> apps that are compatible with the Vision Pro and that are able to run on the device.<br/>
<br/>

When the Vision Pro launched, Apple said there were more than 600 apps available for the headset, so the number of apps has increased by over 400 in the weeks since the Vision Pro debuted. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A huge thank you to our developers! Their hard work has already resulted in over 1,000 incredible spatial apps designed specifically for Vision Pro, along with over 1.5 million compatible apps.

The Vision Pro is able to run many of the apps that are on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, but the 1,000 app count is for those that have been designed for and optimized for the headset. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is losing yet another longtime industrial design team members, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-13/apple-s-longest-serving-designer-bart-andre-retiring-from-company">Bloomberg</a></em>. Bart Andre, who has been with Apple for over 30 years, is set to retire this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Green.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912516" /><br/>
Andre joined Apple in 1992 alongside Jony Ive, and he is one of the last remaining design team members that worked with Ive to establish the design aesthetic Apple was known for during Ive's tenure.<br/>
<br/>
Andre has been helping run the design team following the 2022 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/21/apple-announces-evans-hankey-leaving/">departure of Evans Hankey</a>, who served as Apple's vice president of industrial design after Ive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/27/jony-ive-leaving-apple/">left in 2019</a>. When Ive quit Apple to start LoveFrom, several of the designers he had worked with went with him, and since then, other design team members <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ive-era-designer-leaves-apple/">have departed as well</a>.<br/>
<br/>
After Evans Hankey left, Apple eliminated the Product Design Chief role and restructured the product design team under operations chief Jeff Williams. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, some of the people on the design team are unhappy with being led by an operations person instead of a designer, and cost cutting efforts have also changed the way the design team operates.<br/>
<br/>
Apple now has only a handful of longtime designers that remain at the company.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/another-longtime-industrial-designer-leaves-apple/">Another Longtime Industrial Designer Leaves Apple</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/another-longtime-industrial-designer-leaves-apple.2419384/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>tvOS 17.4 Allegedly Hints at HomePod With Display</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The tvOS 17.4 beta that was released today contains code that references a future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> with a display, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/13/references-homepod-screen-tvos-17-4/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The site claims that there is evidence of a device with a "Z314" identifier with an A15 chip inside, with both production and "internal" versions of the device being tested by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/homepod-blue-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895477" /><br/>
<blockquote>Based on our findings, the unreleased "Z314" device is powered by an A15 Bionic chip, which interestingly is the same as the iPad mini 6. Code reveals that there are internal development and also production versions of this product under test, which suggests that it may have reached an advanced stage of development.</blockquote><br/>
The latest beta also reportedly adds SwiftUI frameworks to the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; firmware to support a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a display.<br/>
<br/>
We've heard multiple rumors about a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a touchscreen display from reliable sources. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said in March 2023 that there was a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">7-inch display in development</a>, and in October 2023, leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/future-homepod-to-add-curved-lcd-display/">Kosutami</a> said the next-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; would have a design similar to the current model but with a large LCD touch screen at the top instead of an LED array.<br/>
<br/>
HomePods to date have been equipped with the same chips that Apple uses in the Apple Watch rather than the A-series chips used in Apple devices, so <em>9to5Mac</em>'s finding of an A15 Bionic mention could reflect a shift. The S9 chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> is, however, based on the A15 Bionic, and so that would also make sense for a new &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
In 2023, Kuo claimed that the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with display would launch in the first half of 2024, but we have not heard additional release details since then. It is not yet clear when the device might come out, but Apple is planning to debut new iPads and Macs around the March timeframe, so we might also see a new &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; at that time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/tvos-17-4-homepod-display/">tvOS 17.4 Allegedly Hints at HomePod With Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-17-4-allegedly-hints-at-homepod-with-display.2419371/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/ios-17-3-airplay-hotel-room-tvs/">with iOS 17.3</a> and iPadOS 17.3, you can wirelessly stream content from your iPhone or iPad to a compatible hotel room TV via AirPlay, and we have now learned that the feature should begin rolling out at hotels over the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/AirPlay-Hotel-Room-TV.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="892" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936284" /><br/>
A spokesperson for LG today informed <em>MacRumors</em> that the company expects the first hotels to install AirPlay-enabled smart TVs "later this spring," meaning that the feature should be available by mid-June at the latest. LG last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/22/lg-airplay-hotel-room-tvs/">announced</a> that it would be the first manufacturer to offer this capability on both new hotel room TVs and models released in "recent years," suggesting it could also be enabled with a software update on some existing models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first announced this feature at WWDC 2023 last June, and it said that IHG Hotels & Resorts would be the first to offer it at select hotels. IHG owns many well-known hotel brands in the U.S. and abroad, including Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza, Kimpton, InterContinental, Candlewood Suites, Staybridge Suites, Hotel Indigo, Avid, and others.<br/>
<br/>
IHG and other major hotel companies, including Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, Wyndham, and others, did not respond to our requests for comment.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airplay-hotels.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898340" /><br/>
Once available, the feature will allow you to scan a unique QR code on a hotel room TV to establish an AirPlay connection, allowing you to wirelessly stream videos, music, and photos from your iPhone or iPad to the TV. After the pairing process, your device will also automatically be connected to the hotel's Wi-Fi network.<br/>
<br/>
"With no logins or passwords to remember and no separate app to download, this will be the simplest way for a hotel to enable guests to access their personal entertainment apps and accounts on the big screen in their room," LG said last year.<br/>
<br/>
Google already offers a similar Chromecast streaming feature on some hotel TVs that works with both iPhones and Android devices.<br/>
<br/>
With thousands of hotels across the U.S. alone, it will likely take a long time for the AirPlay-enabled TVs to roll out widely. Where it is available, the feature will provide a much improved experience for quickly and seamlessly streaming content.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg/">LG</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/lg-says-airplay-hotel-tvs-coming-soon/">iOS 17&#039;s AirPlay Feature for Hotel Room TVs Rolling Out &#039;This Spring&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17s-airplay-feature-for-hotel-room-tvs-rolling-out-this-spring.2419366/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.1 update for developers, allowing them to test new features ahead of the software seeing a public launch. The second beta comes a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-releases-first-beta-of-visionos-1-1/">release of the first beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934088" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-Home-Screen.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
The &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 adds an option to reset the Vision Pro in case you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/visionos-1-1-beta-vision-pro-reset-option/">forget your passcode</a>, a feature that was also just released to the public with &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.3 yesterday. Previously, a forgotten passcode would require the Vision Pro to be brought to Apple to reset it.<br/>
<br/>
The update brings support for iMessage Contact Key Verification and it adds Apple device management to the Vision Pro. With this functionality, IT departments at companies and educational institutions can manage Vision Pro headsets in the same way they manage iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's beta notes, users can now reposition volumetric scenes closer than before, enabling easier direct interaction with the volumetric scene content. That means objects can be placed closer to you.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also improved Personas in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj;, making them look more natural and lifelike than before. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/visionos-1-1-beta-2/">Apple Releases Second Beta of visionOS 1.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-second-beta-of-visionos-1-1.2419356/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 to developers for testing purposes, with the updates coming one week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-beta-2/">Apple seeded the second betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932463" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 introduces sweeping changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union, paving the way for alternative app marketplaces, alternative payment systems, third-party browser engine support, and NFC access for banks and third-party payment providers. These features are limited to the EU, and won't be available in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
There are, however, changes to gaming apps, and with the launch of iOS 17.4, Apple will be allowing cloud gaming apps like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW. Mini games, chatbots, and plug-ins are also now able to use the in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
Along with these updates, iOS 17.4 adds new emoji characters, transcripts for podcasts in the Podcasts app, support for using SharePlay with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, Stopwatch Live Activities, and more. Full details on everything new in iOS 17.4 can be found in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1-changes/">our iOS 17.4 features article</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/ios-17-4-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Betas of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-betas-of-ios-17-4-and-ipados-17-4-to-developers.2419351/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.4‌ update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, watchOS 10.4 can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.4 includes new emoji characters such as a lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).<br/>
<br/>
There is also a Vision Pro setting to disable the Double Tap feature on Apple Watch, as the hand gestures might interfere.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/watchos-10-4-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Beta of watchOS 10.4 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-beta-of-watchos-10-4-to-developers.2419352/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.4 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software releases are usually minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes.<br/>
<br/>
The tvOS 17.4 update adds support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> SharePlay on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. The &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; user can pull up an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; QR code that can be scanned by anyone, which then allows multiple people to contribute to what's playing via &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;. An &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription is not required.<br/>
<br/>
We've also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/">seen references to homeOS</a> in tvOS 17.4, but it's not yet clear what homeOS is.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the launch of the Vision Pro, Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Apple_Vision_Pro_Privacy_Overview.pdf">shared a new document</a> outlining various privacy and security measures for the headset.<br/>
<br/>

An overview of some of the Vision Pro's privacy policies, according to Apple:<ul><li>Where you look before you interact with content is not shared with Apple or the apps you are using, and does not leave the device.</li><br/>
<li>Apps you use cannot access information about your surroundings by default.</li><br/>
<li>visionOS does not share information about who may be physically nearby with the apps and websites that you use, or with Apple.</li><br/>
<li>Personas are generated entirely on-device, and associated data is encrypted.</li><br/>
<li>Optic ID data for iris authentication is encrypted and never leaves the device.</li><br/>
<li>You can limit the apps that someone else can interact with in Guest User mode to just those currently visible.</li></ul>More details are available in <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Apple_Vision_Pro_Privacy_Overview.pdf">Apple's document</a>, shared earlier <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/13/apple-vision-pro-privacy/">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple privacy features available on visionOS include App Tracking Transparency, Advanced Data Protection, iCloud Private Relay, Hide My Email, and more. iMessage Contact Key Verification was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/vision-pro-imessage-contact-key-verification/">added in the visionOS 1.1 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>

These deals will only last for the remainder of today, so if you've been waiting for great Apple Watch deals, now is the time to buy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-watch-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930418" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can also get the 45mm GPS Apple Watch Series 9 for <a href="https://howl.me/clCSlnQ3Uf2"><strong>&#36;339.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;429.00. Both of these deals are solid second-best prices that are just &#36;10 higher when compared to their previous all-time low prices.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clyFscY8CSo"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;90 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm GPS) for &#36;309.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Best Buy has every aluminum model of the GPS Apple Watch Series 9 on sale, so you can get the Starlight, Pink, Midnight, Silver, and PRODUCT(RED) colors on sale at these record low prices. This also includes both S/M and M/L band sizes.<br/>
<br/>
Best Buy also has cellular models of the Apple Watch Series 9 at best-ever prices. You can get the 41mm Cellular model for <a href="https://howl.me/clCSmJRGjPH"><strong>&#36;409.00</strong></a> and the 45mm Cellular model for <a href="https://howl.me/clyFvAK7DJA"><strong>&#36;439.00</strong></a>, both of which are &#36;90 markdowns. Stock on cellular models is much more strained, so you'll only find a few aluminum colors on sale at these prices.<br/>
<br/>
As of last month, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/">sales ban was reenacted</a> in the United States on any Apple Watch model sold by Apple that has blood oxygen sensing. While Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models purchased directly from Apple currently come with blood oxygen sensing disabled, retailers like Best Buy are able to continue selling through their existing stocks that include the feature.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for cheaper Apple Watches, you can also get the Apple Watch SE on sale at Best Buy, all of which are at &#36;60 off. The 40mm GPS model is available for <a href="https://howl.me/clCR9B9mui9"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a>, the 44mm GPS model is available for <a href="https://howl.me/clCSfvk0ZUD"><strong>&#36;219.00</strong></a>, the 40mm cellular model is available for <a href="https://howl.me/clCSggfrO9d"><strong>&#36;239.00</strong></a>, and the 44mm cellular model is available for <a href="https://howl.me/clCSgFaNYsz"><strong>&#36;269.00</strong></a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iMessage will avoid regulation requiring interoperability with other messaging platforms under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), following the conclusion of an investigation by the regulator (via <em><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-13/apple-imessage-microsoft-bing-dodge-eu-s-big-tech-crackdown">Bloomberg</a></em></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
The probe concluded that the iMessage platform and Microsoft's Bing do not hold a dominant enough position to be brought under the DMA's strict rules for services provided by big tech's so-called digital "gatekeepers," which include Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, according to the EU.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and Microsoft said they welcomed the decision to not designate them as core platform services in separate statements following the announcement. <br/>
<br/>
The EU has been working on legislation under the DMA that would have required Apple to make changes to iMessage to make it available on other platforms. The interoperability rules would have meant that Meta apps like WhatsApp or Messenger could request to interoperate with Apple's iMessage framework, and Apple would have been forced to comply within the EU. <br/>
<br/>
However, the EU probe found that iMessage falls outside the legislation because it is not widely used by businesses. The reprieve for Apple is part of a five-month market investigation by the European Commission. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Peloton is dropping support for Apple GymKit in favor of Peloton One-Tap tracking, the fitness equipment company revealed to users in an email on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/peloton-bike-plus-treadmill-gymkit.jpg" alt="" width="921" height="457" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757966" /><br/>
The change is most likely to irk existing Bike+ owners who originally purchased the &#36;2,495 stationary workout bike based on the premise that GymKit was an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/08/peloton-announces-bike-gymkit-support/">exclusive perk</a>. While GymKit has become less important since Peloton rolled out Apple Watch integration to all its fitness equipment in 2022, GymKit offered additional integration with Apple Health that isn't available with Peloton's solution.<br/>
<br/>
Peloton's app does most of the things that GymKit offers, including tracking things like distance, pace, and heart rate metrics, and showing them live on Peloton screens. Only a subset of that data will, however, now sync to Apple Health in the absence of GymKit support.<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced GymKit as part of watchOS 4.1, which was released back in October 2017.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update</b>: As <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/posts/32935433">noted</a> by forum member Eradik and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pelotoncycle/comments/1ape43k/apple_gymkit_no_longer_supported_as_of_227/">others on Reddit,</a> Peloton's app syncs only basic data to Apple Health. Data like cadence and average speed and power are not synced, meaning that the loss of GymKit support may have a substantial impact for some users.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gymkit/">GymKit</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peloton/">Peloton</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/peloton-losing-apple-watch-gymkit-support/">Peloton Is Dropping Apple Watch GymKit Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/peloton-is-dropping-apple-watch-gymkit-support.2419319/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Video content no longer includes Dolby Vision HDR or Dolby Atmos surround sound on its ads-supported tier, which is included in all Amazon Prime memberships.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Amazon-Prime-Video-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936178" /><br/>
The news was first reported by German website <em><a href="https://www.4kfilme.de/amazon-prime-video-entfernt-dolby-atmos-und-dolby-vision-im-werbefinanzierten-abo/#google_vignette">4KFilme</a></em> and picked up by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24071417/amazon-prime-video-no-dolby-vision-atmos">The Verge</a></em>. Instead of the higher fidelity options previously enjoyed for no additional fee, Prime Video is streaming in HDR10 with Dolby Digital 5.1. <br/>
<br/>
That is, unless you pay &#36;2.99 extra for Prime Video's ad-free service, in which case you can retain the higher quality audio experience. The change was confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> by Amazon. <br/>
<br/>
"Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos capabilities are only available on the ad free option, on relevant titles," said an Amazon spokesperson.<br/>
<br/>
Most Prime Video viewers will be Amazon Prime members, which costs &#36;14.99 per month, or &#36;139 per year if you pay annually. Prime Video is also available as a &#36;9.99-per-month standalone subscription, or &#36;12.99-per-month if you add on the Dolby Vision HDR or Dolby Atmos surround sound surcharge. Ads were introduced across basic Prime Video subscriptions in the United States on January 29.<br/>
<br/>
For comparison, Disney+ costs &#36;9.99 with ads, while Netflix can be had for &#36;6.99 per month with ads, although content is streamed in 1080p. Meanwhile, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> membership costs &#36;9.99, up from the previous &#36;6.99. Apple introduced the increase on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">October 25</a>, but there are no limits on streaming quality.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon-prime-video/">Amazon Prime Video</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon-prime/">Amazon Prime</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/amazon-prime-video-dolby-vision-atmos/">Amazon Prime Video&#039;s Ads Tier Loses Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amazon-prime-videos-ads-tier-loses-dolby-vision-hdr-and-dolby-atmos.2419316/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well-known talk show host Jon Stewart today confirmed that Apple canceled his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> series "The Problem with Jon Stewart" over content concerns. In a discussion with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/jon-stewart-on-why-hes-going-back-to-the-daily-show-anchor-desk/">CBS Mornings</a> (via <em><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/jon-stewart-explains-apple-exit-why-streamer-canceled-the-problem-1235907986/">Variety</a></em>), Stewart said that Apple did not want him to "say things" that might get him into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/problem-jon-stewart.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917873" /><br/>
<blockquote>I wanted a place to unload thoughts as we get into this election season. I thought I was going to do it over at -- they call it Apple TV+. It's a television enclave, very small. It's like living in Malibu. But they decided ... they felt that they didn't want me to say things that might get me in trouble.</blockquote><br/>
Stewart's television show <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/apple-tv-show-problem-jon-steward-canceled/">was canceled last October</a> ahead of the launch of the third season, and rumors at the time suggested that he had run into "creative differences" with Apple executives. A report from <em>The New York Times</em> claimed that the disagreements were over some planned guests, show topics related to China, and topics related to artificial intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Stewart did not provide details on the specific things that he and Apple clashed over, but he has now validated the rumors over the reason why his &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; series was canceled. Such a high profile cancelation could impact Apple's ability to get similar hosts for future projects, as there could be worries over Apple's level of control. Stewart's show explored current affairs "problems" and episodes featured everything from news in the national conversation to issues that were part of Stewart's advocacy work.<br/>
<br/>
Apple canceled "The Problem with Jon Stewart" ahead of the 2024 election year. Stewart has decided to make a return to "The Daily Show," where he will appear every Monday night through the election cycle. His first return show airs tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Stewart was the host of "The Daily Show" for more than 15 years, and he stepped down eight years ago to hand the reins over to Trevor Noah. Noah retired last year, and so the series has been looking for a new host.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/jon-stewart-confirms-apple-tv-cancelation-reason/">Jon Stewart Confirms Apple Canceled Show: &#039;They Didn&#039;t Want Me to Say Things That Might Get Me in Trouble&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jon-stewart-confirms-apple-canceled-show-they-didnt-want-me-to-say-things-that-might-get-me-in-trouble.2419279/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.0.3 update for the Vision Pro headset, marking the first update that Apple has provided since the device launched. The software comes two weeks after the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2/">visionOS 1.0.2 update</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
The new &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update can be installed by opening the settings app and going to the software update section. <br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.3, Apple added an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213958">option to reset the Vision Pro headset</a> if the passcode set on the device has been forgotten. It also includes unspecified bug fixes. Apple's release notes:<blockquote>This update provides important bug fixes and adds an option to reset your device if you’ve forgotten your passcode.</blockquote>The Vision Pro launched without a way to reset the device without first unlocking it with a passcode, so those who did end up forgetting their passcodes had to go to an Apple retail store to reset it. With the update, if a passcode is rejected a certain number of times, users will get an option to erase the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Note that erasing the Vision Pro does not remove Activation Lock, so a person who stole the headset and used this feature to wipe it would still not be able to log in with their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-3/">Apple Releases visionOS 1.0.3 With Reset Option for Forgotten Passcode</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-3-with-reset-option-for-forgotten-passcode.2419277/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that Apple has launched its Vision Pro headset, we can shift our attention towards what is next on the company's agenda for the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/New-Macs-iPads-iOS-17-4.jpg" alt="" width="3198" height="1798" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936049" /><br/>
As usual, March should be a busy time for Apple, as it is expected to release new MacBook Air, iPad Pro, and iPad Air models during the month. In a recent press release, Apple also confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released in March.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap what to expect from Apple next month.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Macs and iPads</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Apple will likely launch new MacBook Air, iPad Pro, and iPad Air models "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">around the end of March</a>," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air are expected to be updated with the M3 chip simultaneously, with key benefits over the M2 chip including faster performance and hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes are expected for the MacBook Air this year, but the laptop will likely gain support for Wi-Fi 6E like other Macs.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already updated the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip in October 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPad Pro models are widely expected to be the first iPads equipped with more vivid OLED displays. Other rumored or likely features for the iPad Pro include the M3 chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">MagSafe wireless charging</a>, a redesigned Magic Keyboard with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">larger trackpad and an aluminum top casing</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">larger 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> is expected alongside an updated 10.9-inch model. Other rumored or likely features for the iPad Air include the M2 chip, a redesigned rear camera bump, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.4</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">press release</a> announcing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major App Store changes in the EU</a>, Apple confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released in March:<blockquote>Developers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</blockquote>In addition to the changes in the EU, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/04/ios-17-4-new-features-and-changes/">key new features in iOS 17.4</a> include Apple Podcasts transcripts, SharePlay for the HomePod, new emoji, and the ability to use the Apple Cash card on more websites by generating a virtual card number. The update also includes preparations for the launch of next-generation CarPlay later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Other software updates expected to be released in March include iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, watchOS 10.4, tvOS 17.4, and visionOS 1.1. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>New iPhone Color?</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-14-Yellow-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887956" /><br/>
Apple often introduces new iPhone colors around March or April, midway through the smartphone's annual release cycle.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>March 2023:</strong> Apple made the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/07/apple-announces-yellow-iphone-14/">available in Yellow</a>.</li><br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-15-Pro-vs-16-Pro-Feature-Cyan-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-935694" /></div><br/>
All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their direct forerunners are listed below, using information from reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="displays">Displays</h3><br/>
Both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature larger displays than their predecessors, pushing the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max to be the biggest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> ever offered. There are also reportedly improvements to the underlying OLED technology in store.<br/>
