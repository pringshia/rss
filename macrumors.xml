		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking deals on Apple's <a href="https://howl.me/cmtYtvdOtL2">fifth-generation iPad Air</a>, which are only available on Best Buy. This sale includes nearly every model of the M1 iPad Air on sale at an all-time low price, with as much as &#36;250 off select models. The deals are part of Best Buy's Prime Day-like "<a href="https://howl.me/cmFRZqv6lnW">Black Friday in July</a>" sale, which lasts through Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the 64GB Wi-Fi M1 iPad Air, Best Buy has this model for <a href="https://howl.me/cmtYtvdOtL2"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;599.99. This is an all-time low price on this model of the 2022 iPad Air, and it's available in three colors. You'll also find the 256GB Wi-Fi iPad Air on sale for &#36;499.99, down from &#36;749.99, which is about &#36;50 cheaper than the previous record low price.<br/>

<br/>
Apple introduced new M2 iPad Air models in May, which is why we're seeing steep discounts on the previous generation models more often. You can still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/early-prime-day-m2-ipad-air/">save a bit of money on the 2024 models</a> if you're interested in owning the latest version.<br/>
<br/>
Best Buy's <a href="https://howl.me/cmFRZqv6lnW">Black Friday in July</a> event has much more on sale than just the iPad Air, including <a href="https://howl.me/cmFR5CIOn2i">other Apple products</a> like MacBooks and Apple Watches. You can also find great deals on TVs, video games, appliances, headphones, smartphones, sound bars, streaming devices, computers, and much more.<br/>

This is the first time we've tracked discounts on these computers in a few weeks, and they're reaching up to &#36;200 off original prices.<br/>
<br/>

Shoppers should note that Best Buy is offering an extra &#36;50 in savings on these computers, but you'll need to have a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership in order to see the discounts. Otherwise, if you don't have a membership, you can find matching prices on every M3 MacBook Air at Best Buy.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/07/apple-introduces-homepod-mini-in-midnight/">announced</a> that the existing HomePod mini is now available in a Midnight color option, which replaces the nearly-identical Space Gray color previously offered. The speaker remains available in Blue, Orange, White, and Yellow as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/HomePod-Mini-Midnight-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958753" /><br/>
Apple now offers both the full-sized second-generation HomePod and the HomePod mini in Midnight, so this minor change brings some consistency to the lineup. Apple did not mention any other changes to the HomePod mini today, and the speaker remains priced at &#36;99 in the U.S. for all of the color options.<br/>
<br/>
The new Midnight color option <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini">can be ordered on Apple.com</a> starting today, and it will be available at Apple Store locations in the U.S., Canada, China, Singapore, and 28 other countries and regions starting July 17.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first released the HomePod mini in November 2020, and it has yet to release a second-generation model of the speaker.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/homepod-mini-midnight-color/">Apple Releases HomePod Mini in New Midnight Color</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-homepod-mini-in-new-midnight-color.2431376/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple typically releases its new iPhone series around mid-September, which means we are about two months out from the launch of the iPhone 16. Like the iPhone 15 series, this year's lineup is expected to stick with four models – iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max – although there are plenty of design differences and new features to take into account.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
To bring you up to speed, we've summarized below the biggest iPhone 16 rumors we've covered so far here on <em>MacRumors</em>. For more details, follow the links, or dive into our dedicated roundups for both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    1. Larger Displays</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Biggest Ever iPhones</span><br><br/>
This year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to be getting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">bigger display sizes</a>, increasing to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The new display sizes would be the largest ever for the iPhone.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    2. Vertical Camera Layout</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 16 base models will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">vertical camera arrangement</a> with a pill-shaped raised surface, instead of a diagonal camera arrangement like the iPhone 15. The new camera bump features two separate camera rings for the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras. The vertical camera layout is expected to enable Spatial Video recording, which is currently limited to the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
3. Battery Changes</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 16 Models</span><br><br/>
One rumor suggests the ‌iPhone 16‌ and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">larger batteries</a> than their predecessors, but the ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus may have reduced capacity. The iPhone 16 is said to have a 6% increase over the iPhone 15, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max gaining a 5% increase. In contrast, the iPhone 16 Plus is rumored to have a 9% reduction in capacity. On the other hand, Apple could also potentially use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/iphone-15-hybrid-lens-rumor/">stacked battery technology</a> to increase energy density and prolong lifespan across the lineup. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
4. Capture Button</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">New Camera Capabilities</span><br><br/>
All iPhone 16 models will have a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">Capture Button</a>" dedicated to triggering image or video capture. The button will add features like the ability to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus on a subject with a light press, and activate a recording with a more forceful press. The Capture Button will be located on the bottom right side of the ‌iPhone 16, and will take the place of the mmWave antenna on U.S. ‌iPhone‌ models, with the antenna relocating to the left side of the device below the volume and Action buttons.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
5. Ultra Wide Lens Upgrade</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to feature an upgraded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera lens</a>, which should allow it to capture more light, resulting in improved photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments. This also means that iPhone 16 Pro models should be able to shoot 48-megapixel ProRAW photos in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/iphone-16-pro-dual-48mp-cameras/">rumored</a> to boast a bigger main camera thanks to an advanced custom 48-megapixel Sony IMX903 sensor.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
6. Super Telephoto Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro Max could be the first to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/iphone-16-pro-max-super-telephoto-camera/">super telephoto periscope camera</a> for dramatically increased optical zoom. "Super" or "ultra" telephoto usually describes cameras with a focal length of over 300mm. The current telephoto lens is equivalent to a 77mm lens, so if accurate, there could be a notable increase in zoom capabilities. Super telephoto cameras are often used for sports and wild animal photography, but the extremely soft backgrounds they create also make them useful for portrait photography, providing there is enough distance between the subject and the photographer.<br/>

7. Faster Wi-Fi Support</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Wi-Fi 6E & Wi-Fi 7</span><br><br/>
Apple's 2024 iPhone Pro models are expected to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">Wi-Fi 7 in the Pro models</a>, enabling data transfer over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously. This should result in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. With technologies such as 4K QAM, Wi-Fi 7 is  also expected to offer peak data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">rumored to support Wi-Fi 6E</a>, which works with the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
8. New A18 Series Chips</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 16 Models</span><br><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">next-generation A18 Pro chip</a> is expected to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E. All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to rumors, but Apple could still differentiate between the standard models and the Pro models, even giving the chips separate A18 and A18 Pro names. It makes sense for all four ‌iPhone 16‌ models to have the same A18 chip because of the Apple Intelligence features set to debut in iOS 18. Apple Intelligence requires a high-powered chip for the AI features to run on-device. At this time, only the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and Pro Max are able to use Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
9. 5G Qualcomm Modem</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple is expected to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-5g-advanced-rumor/">Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X75 modem</a> in this year's Pro and Pro Max models. The Snapdragon X75 includes improved carrier aggregation and other technology advancements for faster 5G download and upload speeds compared to the X70, which is used in iPhone 15 models. The modem's combined mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G transceiver also takes up 25% less circuit board space, and is said to use up to 20% less power. The standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to retain the Snapdragon X70 modem.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
10. Tetraprism Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro</span><br><br/>
Both iPhone 16 Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">expected to feature 5x optical zoom</a>, which is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple's tetraprism lens system has a "folded" design that allows it to fit inside the smartphone, enabling up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom. In contrast, the current smaller iPhone 15 Pro is limited to up to 3x optical zoom, which is in line with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
11. Micro-Lens Technology</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">More Efficient OLED</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be weighing up the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/iphone-16-oled-displays-micro-lens-efficiency/">use of micro-lens technology</a> to maintain or increase the brightness of OLED displays on next year's iPhone 16 models while potentially reducing their power consumption. MLA works by using a uniform pattern of billions of lenses inside the panel that reduces internal reflections. These lenses turn the path of light reflected backwards from the inside of the panel towards the screen, which can serve either to increase perceived brightness while maintaining the same level of power consumption, or maintain brightness levels while consuming less power compared to conventional OLED panels at the same luminance.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
12. Action Button</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro models include an Action Button, and in 2024, the Action Button is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">expanded to the standard iPhone 16 models</a>. The Action Button used across the iPhone 16 lineup will be identical to the iPhone 15 Pro Action Button. The Action button, which replaces the traditional mute switch, can perform multiple functions such as activating the Flashlight, turning on the Camera, launching a Shortcut, enabling or disabling a Focus mode, using Translate, turning on/off Silent Mode, and more.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
13. 40W Fast Charging and 20W MagSafe</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will support 40W wired fast charging and 20W MagSafe charging, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/iphone-16-pro-40w-fast-charging-20w-magsafe/">recurring rumor</a>. Right now, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models are capable of up to 27W peak charging speeds with an appropriate USB-C power adapter, while official MagSafe chargers from Apple and authorized third parties can wirelessly charge the iPhone 15 models at up to 15W. The charging boost is expected to balance and improve the problem of increasing charging time caused by the increase in battery capacity. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
14. Upgraded Microphone</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Enhanced Siri</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">significant upgrade</a> to the iPhone 16 microphone to improve the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/">Apple Intelligence-enhanced Siri experience</a>, which will include contextual awareness, semantic indexing, app control, and on-screen awareness. Apple's Siri AI ambitions will heavily rely on improved voice input processing, and the new mic is expected to offer significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
15. New Thermal Design</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Reduced Heat</span><br><br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">graphene thermal system</a> for the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup, while the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models could add metal battery casings to reduce overheating. Graphene has high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper, which is currently used in iPhone heat-sinks. Apple has been filing patents related to using graphene for thermal management for some time. The move could be in response to widely encountered overheating issues experienced with the iPhone 15 Pro, which Apple addressed through a software update.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
16. Expanded Storage</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available with double the maximum storage capacity as the iPhone 15 Pro models, increasing from 1TB to 2TB, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">according to one rumor</a>. The move is said to be a result of Apple's switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash for higher storage models. Apple's use of QLC NAND could allow Apple to fit more storage into a smaller space and it is less expensive than Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND, which current iPhones use. On the downside, QLC has comparatively slower read and write speeds.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
17. Increased Memory</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models have been rumored to both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">feature 8GB of RAM</a>, an increase over the 6GB of RAM in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. More working memory should equate to improved performance for multitasking on the iPhone. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/apple-iphone-15-pro-requirement-apple-intelligence/">hinted</a> that plenty of RAM is required for Apple Intelligence features, so it is perhaps no coincidence that all devices in the iPhone 16 lineup will have at least 8GB of RAM.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
18. Upgraded Neural Engine</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Enhanced Machine Learning</span><br><br/>
Apple's next-generation A18 chips will feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">upgraded Neural Engine</a> with "significantly" more cores, according to one Taiwanese report. An upgraded Neural Engine should improve the performance of Apple Intelligence features and machine learning tasks. Apple's iPhone 12 through iPhone 15 models all include a 16-core Neural Engine. Despite no difference in core counts across generations, Apple has still managed to improve their performance in successive models.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
19. Ultra-Thin Bezel Technology</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Maximized Display Size</span><br><br/>
Apple plans to maximize the display size on the iPhone 16 series by using a new ultra-thin bezel technology, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/">according to one rumor</a>. Apple will use Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology to minimize the bezel at the bottom of the display. BRS achieves this by rolling up the internal copper wiring into a more compact package. Apple reportedly plans to apply the borderless display technology to all four iPhone 16 models, but the Pro models will have the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/iphone-16-pro-thinnest-bezels-smartphone/">thinnest bezels of any smartphone</a>, beating the screen border thinness of even its latest iPhone 15 Pro devices.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
20. New Polished Titanium Finish</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple will use an improved finishing process for the titanium chassis on the iPhone 16 Pro models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/">according to one rumor</a>. The new process will allegedly make the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max look more polished than the iPhone 15 Pro models, which have a brushed finish. The improved manufacturing process will result in a glossy appearance that is more akin to the heavily polished stainless steel material used in previous Pro iPhones. However, the new titanium finish will be less prone to scratches compared to stainless steel.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
21. Reduced Lens Flare</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Less Photo Artifacts</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/iphone-16-pro-camera-reduced-lens-flare/">testing</a> a new anti-reflective optical coating technology for its iPhone cameras that could improve the quality of photos by reducing artifacts like lens flare and ghosting. Apple plans to bring new atomic layer deposition (ALD) equipment into the iPhone camera lens manufacturing process to apply the coating. ALD-applied materials can also protect against environmental damage to the camera lens system without affecting the sensor's ability to capture light effectively.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
22. New Colors</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 16 Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/iphone-16-lineup-to-come-in-these-two-new-colors/">expected</a> to be available in black, white or silver, gray or "Natural Titanium," and rose. This suggests that the iPhone 15 Pro's Blue Titanium option will be discontinued and replaced with a new rose color. Meanwhile, the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus is said to be coming in black, green, pink, blue, and white. Compared to the iPhone 15, this means that white will replace yellow, with the other colors remaining the same.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/iphone-16-series-all-the-latest-rumors/">iPhone 16 Series Is Just Two Months Away: Everything We Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-series-is-just-two-months-away-everything-we-know.2431371/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this weekend approved free PC emulator "UTM SE" for the App Store on iPhone, iPad, and Vision Pro. The app allows users to emulate old versions of Windows OS, macOS, Linux, and more to fire up classic software and games on Apple devices. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/utm-se-pc-emulator-ios.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958701" /><br/>
As the first of its kind to be allowed on the App Store, UTM SE offers several unique features like VGA mode support for graphics and terminal mode for text-only OSes, emulation of x86, PPC, and RISC-V architectures, support for pre-built machines, and the ability to create custom bootable machines.<br/>
<br/>
Apple initially rejected the app in June, despite changing its global App Store policy in April regarding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">retro game emulators</a>. According to the developers, Apple <a href="https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1799647652134654045">said</a> the app violated rule 4.7 of its App Review Guidelines because "PC is not a console," regardless of the fact that there are retro Windows/DOS games for the PC that UTM SE can be useful in running. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also deemed UTM SE unsuitable for third-party marketplaces in the European Union, because it violated rule 2.5.2 of its Notarization Review Guidelines. That rule states that apps have to be self-contained and can't execute code "which introduces or changes features or functionality of the app, including other apps."<br/>
<br/>
After Apple's rejection, UTM's developer said they would not keep going back and forth because the app would become "a subpar experience." However, after help from the AltStore team and <a href="https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1812241740172263663">another developer</a> to work on some changes, UTM SE was finally approved by Apple on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
As with other emulators, UTM SE requires that users supply the operating systems they want to emulate, but the <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/">UTM site includes guides</a> for Windows XP through Windows 11 emulation, as well as downloads of pre-built virtual Linux machines. UTM SE can be downloaded from the App Store [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/utm-se-retro-pc-emulator/id1564628856">Direct Link</a>].<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-approves-first-retro-pc-emulator-ios/">Apple Approves First Retro PC Emulator for iPhone, iPad, and Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-approves-first-retro-pc-emulator-for-iphone-ipad-and-vision-pro.2431363/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Game emulator <a href="https://deltaemulatorapp.com/ipad/">Delta</a>, which has been a hit among retro gaming enthusiasts on iPhone, is now officially available for iPad, following an app update to version 1.6.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/delta-emulator-ipad.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="866" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958693" /><br/>
Delta has been hugely popular since its debut on the App Store and the emulator has been a constant presence in the Top Charts, with users flocking to play retro games that originally appeared on NES, SNES, N64, Nintendo DS, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance.<br/>
<br/>
With iPad support in v1.6, users can now take full advantage of the device's larger display and play in fullscreen. There are new controller skins designed specifically for iPad, and the app supports multiple windows in Stage Manager and Split View, with games able to optionally pause when switching windows. The iPad version also supports external game controllers, and the developer Riley Testut says emulated games "hand off" seamlessly between iPhone and iPad, allowing gamers to continue playing where they left off. <br/>
<br/>
Testut says the need for BIOS files has now been eliminated, streamlining the setup process. Users should also notice a considerable improvement in the performance of DS games. The update introduces various menu button gestures, providing more intuitive navigation options. An experimental feature, "Reverse Controller Skin Screens," has also been added, allowing users to switch controller skin screens at runtime, offering greater customization and flexibility during gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
Testut previously explained that Delta for iPad had not originally been a development priority because the plan was to limit the emulator's launch to the EU via alternative app marketplace AltStore PAL, which doesn't support iPad.<br/>
<br/>
However, in a reversal of a years-old policy, Apple in April decided to allow retro game emulators on the ‌App Store‌. Delta was therefore made available on the App Store as a free download in the United States and other countries, with users supporting the developer via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane?utm_source=search">Patreon</a>. Official download links for the latest version can be found on the <a href="https://deltaemulatorapp.com/ipad/">Delta website</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/14/popular-delta-retro-game-emulator-ipad/">Popular Delta Retro Game Emulator Officially Comes to iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/popular-delta-retro-game-emulator-officially-comes-to-ipad.2431316/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Given the similarities, we thought we'd compare Samsung's new earbuds to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Galaxy Buds3 Pro vs AirPods Pro" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_aTHWKmo9c" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Design wise, you could potentially mistake Samsung's Galaxy Buds3 Pro for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. The Buds3 Pro have the same general shape and a silicone tip, though it's worth noting that the Buds3 Pro come in both white and gray, so you're not limited to white as you are with the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2. The charging case is similar to the AirPods Charging Case too, but there's a transparent upper portion.<br/>
<br/>
The Buds3 Pro sound great out of the box, but there is an option to adjust the sound using the equalizer, which isn't possible with the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2. The Active Noise Cancellation and the "Ambient Mode" or transparency on the Buds3 Pro work as well as those features on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, and it's tough to tell the difference between them.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's Buds3 Pro do not perform as well as the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; when it comes to ambient noise detection to adjust sound, however. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; can adjust sound when someone is speaking to you so you can hear them, but the Buds3 Pro struggled to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
The Buds3 Pro have a built-in LED light for aesthetics, and there are controls on the stem for adjusting volume. Samsung also added an interpreter mode for translating foreign languages when connected to the most recent Galaxy phones, but the feature wasn't super accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Though the Buds3 Pro are similar to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2, it's hard to see the two as competitors because you're only going to want to use the Buds3 Pro with Android devices, while the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 work best with Apple devices. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users should stick with the AirPods, while Samsung users will want to check out the Buds3 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's Galaxy Buds3 Pro <a href="https://howl.me/cmDIUN6mU8k">are priced at &#36;250</a>, which is the same price as the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2. Pre-orders are available now ahead of a July 24 launch date.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/13/airpods-pro-2-vs-galaxy-buds3-pro/">Apple&#039;s AirPods Pro 2 vs. Samsung&#039;s Galaxy Buds3 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-airpods-pro-2-vs-samsungs-galaxy-buds3-pro.2431266/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is soon to be back with its annual <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime">summertime Prime Day event</a>, lasting for just two days from July 16-17. As it does every year, Prime Day offers shoppers a huge selection of deals across Amazon's storefront, and there are already many deals you can get on sale ahead of the event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/primeday2020_feature3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-763521" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
For our coverage, we're focusing entirely on early discounts for Apple and Apple-related products that can be purchased right now on Amazon. As of today, this includes deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook Air, and more. We're also sharing deals being matched at retailers like Best Buy in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
As is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated over the next few days, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles next week.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon Prime Day requires you to have an <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime membership</strong></a> to take advantage of the discounts. Amazon Prime costs &#36;14.99 per month or &#36;139.00 per year, and it comes with a 30-day free trial for new subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/prime-day-series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2002" height="1126" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958519" /><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>M2 iPad Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/m2-ipad-pro-prime-day.jpg" alt="" width="2002" height="1126" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958610" /><br/>
<br/>
Over at Best Buy, today you can find some of the biggest discounts on the M2 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro that we've seen in months, including both Wi-Fi and cellular tablets. A My Best Buy Plus/Total membership is not required to see these discounts.<br/>
<br/>
With such steep savings, these previous generation iPad Pros are worth looking into purchasing for anyone who wants to prioritize saving money over owning the newest M4 iPad Pro. There are some major differences between the two generations, like the M4's support for Apple Pencil Pro and a new nano-texture display option, so be sure to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-pro-2022-vs-2024/">read about which one works best for you</a> in our Buyer's Guide.<br/>

<br/>
For the newest M4 iPad Pros, Amazon is offering up to &#36;200 off select models of both the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro. Deals are primarily focused on Wi-Fi models, but you can find a few cellular tablets on sale at this time as well.<br/>

Amazon is taking &#36;30 off the Wi-Fi models of the 2022 iPad, starting at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMV%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;319.00</strong></a> for 64GB Wi-Fi.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is moving right along with development and testing on iOS 18 and related software updates, with the third developer betas arriving this past week and public beta versions of most of them expected very shortly.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/top-stories-13jul2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958642" /><br/>
Not all of the new features Apple showed off at WWDC last month will be available right away, however, with some rolling out in later iOS 18 updates over the next year. In particular, significant Siri enhancements with Apple Intelligence are reportedly slated for iOS 18.4 in the spring of 2025. Other news this week included hints of a touchscreen-equipped HomePod and rumors about the next-generation Apple Watch SE, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything New in iOS 18 Beta 3</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-3/">seeded the third beta of iOS 18</a> to developers for testing, and there are a handful of new features and changes. Check out our list of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/everything-new-ios-18-beta-3/">everything new in iOS 18 beta 3</a>, including Dark Mode for additional app icons, tweaks to the Photos app, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" /><br/>
Apple also seeded the third betas of iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, watchOS 11, tvOS 18, visionOS 2, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 Public Beta Coming Soon: How to Get Your iPhone Ready</h2><br/>
Apple last month announced that the first public beta of iOS 18 would be released in July, so it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-public-beta-coming-soon/">should be available to try out soon</a>. The first public betas of iOS 17 and iOS 16 were both released in the first half of July over the past two years, so it is possible that the iOS 18 public beta will be available next week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Public-Beta-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958425" /><br/>
Ahead of time, read our story outlining <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-public-beta-coming-soon/">how to get your iPhone ready for the iOS 18 public beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Siri Experience With Apple Intelligence Likely to Debut in Spring 2025</h2><br/>
While some Apple Intelligence features will be available when iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia are first released to the public later this year, Apple last month said that some of the remaining features will be rolled out "over the course of the next year." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, a smarter version of Siri powered by Apple Intelligence <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/new-siri-experience-to-debut-spring-2025/">will likely launch as part of iOS 18.4 in the spring of 2025</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>tvOS 18 Hints at HomePod With Touchscreen Display</h2><br/>
A reference to an unreleased HomePod with a built-in screen has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/tvos18-homepod-touchscreen-display/">allegedly been uncovered in the tvOS 18 beta</a>, following earlier reports that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/the-macrumors-show-apples-next-big-thing-robots/">Apple plans to release such a device</a> in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/HomePod-With-Screen-and-Arm-FaceTime-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801481" /><em>MacRumors concept mockups based on early rumors</em></div><br/>
Apple is rumored to have been prototyping <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/">several different smart home accessories</a>, including a HomePod with a screen, a smart home hub with a robotic arm, a device that combines a HomePod and Apple TV, and more, but it is unclear if or when all of them will be released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Reportedly Developing Apple Watch SE With Plastic Casing</h2><br/>
Apple is developing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/apple-watch-se-with-plastic-casing/">next-generation version of the low-end Apple Watch SE with a plastic casing</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-se-2022.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-866330" /><br/>
A third-generation Apple Watch SE is expected to be released in September, but it is unclear if Apple will move forward with the plastic casing, which would replace the aluminum casing on previous models. The current Apple Watch SE starts at &#36;249 in the U.S., and the move to plastic could allow for the next model to have an even lower starting price.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>10+ Changes to Control Center in iOS 18</h2><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-control-center/">significantly overhauling Control Center on iOS 18</a> for the first time since iOS 11, with greater customization, multiple pages, additional controls, and more. Apple also now allows users to customize the Flashlight and Camera shortcuts on the Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Control-Center-Guide-1.jpg" alt="" width="2100" height="1180" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958438" /><br/>
Check out our list outlining <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-control-center/">more than 10 new features and changes in Control Center on iOS 18</a>, which will be widely released later this year for the iPhone XS and newer.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> includes updates for many of Apple's built-in apps, and Safari is no exception. Apple's browser has some useful new features for more quickly getting to the information that you want most from websites.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Safari-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958657" /><br/>
This guide highlights everything that's new in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2><br/>
Highlights detects relevant information on a webpage that you're visiting and surfaces it for you so you can find pertinent details without having to scour a page.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ipados-18-safari-highlights.jpg" alt="" width="2150" height="1210" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957170" /><br/>
When a Highlight is available on a webpage, you'll see a small purple sparkle over the tool icon in the browser bar, along with a quick flash to the Highlight data that's available. If you tap on the icon with the sparkle, Safari will show you key website information like location, hours, and directions.<br/>
<br/>
Information that's shown in Highlights will depend on the website you're visiting. For stores, hotels, and other places you might want to go to, Safari will provide directions. For other websites, you might see links to learn more about people, music, movies, and TV shows.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-safari-highlights.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958672" /><br/>
Highlights is available in U.S. English at the current time, and as &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is in beta, this feature is not available on all websites. Highlights can be disabled by opening up the Safari section of the Settings app and toggling it off. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="reader_mode">Reader Mode</h2><br/>
Safari updated Reader Mode to provide a table of contents for long articles and also a quick summary of what's on the page.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-safari-reader-mode.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958666" /><br/>
The new Reader Mode features give users a way to get to a specific part of an article as well as an overview of what's in an article in order to decide whether it's worth continuing to read.<br/>
<br/>
New Reader Mode options are available in English (Australia), English (Canada), English (Ireland), English (New Zealand), English (South Africa), English (UK), and English (U.S.)<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design_changes">Design Changes</h2><br/>
Apple updated the design of the Safari tools that can be accessed through the URL bar. The tool icon is now a box with two lines, and tapping it brings you into full overlay window that's at the bottom of the display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-safari-design-changes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958667" /><br/>
Not all tools are displayed at once anymore, with Apple prioritizing those people might want most like translate, Reader Mode, Privacy Protections, and font size. Tapping on the ellipsis at the bottom of the interface shows the rest of the Safari settings like Show IP Address, Request Desktop Website, and Hide Toolbar.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also changed the design of the tab management page, with a unified toolbar for separate sections and tab groups. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="new_quick_access_options">New Quick Access Options</h3><br/>
Some of the features that used to be tucked away in the Share Sheet are now more readily available through the Safari toolbar.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-safari-menu-options.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958671" /><br/>
New options include the following:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Print</li><br/>
 <li>Add to Favorites</li><br/>
 <li>Add Bookmark</li><br/>
 <li>Add to Quick Note</li><br/>
 <li>Add to Reading List</li><br/>
 <li>Move to Tab Group</li><br/>
 <li>Pin Tab</li><br/>
 <li>Camera Access</li><br/>
 <li>Microphone Access</li><br/>
 <li>Location Access</li><br/>
 <li>Open Links in Profile</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The Page Menu can be edited so that you can customize which tools go in your list of favorites for quicker access.<br/>
<br/>
All of these options are still available through the Share Sheet as well.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="passwords">Passwords</h2><br/>
With a new dedicated Passwords app, Safari logins, passwords, and passkeys are filled in automatically if you have your information saved to the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-passwords-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957056" /><br/>
The Passwords app has the same functionality as the Passwords section in the Settings app, it's simply been split out into a standalone app for easier access. Safari can automatically save login and password information to the Passwords app, and everything syncs cross-device. Passwords can even be accessed on Windows PCs.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="locked_apps">Locked Apps</h2><br/>
Apps like Safari can be locked and hidden, requiring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication to access them. Locking an app goes a step further than the protected private browsing feature that Apple introduced in an earlier version of iOS, as the entire Safari browser can be locked.<br/>
<br/>

To open a locked app, you need to authenticate, so someone who has your unlocked phone still won't be able to see your browser if you lock Safari. Hiding an app locks it and removes it from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, tucking it away in a secret Hidden apps folder in the App Library.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Apple Software and Services chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/pictures/media-mogul-style-sun-valleys-summer-camp-billionaires-2024-07-11/">are attending</a> the annual Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, this weekend. The media finance conference is well-known for attracting some of the biggest names in tech.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/reuters-tim-cook-sun-valley-event.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958647" /><div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/pictures/media-mogul-style-sun-valleys-summer-camp-billionaires-2024-07-11/">Image via Reuters</a></em></div><br/>
<br/>
The Sun Valley Conference has been likened to a camp for billionaires, where tech and media moguls can negotiate deals while golfing, whitewater rafting, and similar activities. Cook and Cue <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/03/tim-cook-2022-sun-valley-conference-guest-list/">are both regulars</a> at the event.<br/>
<br/>
Other attendees this year include Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Oprah Winfrey, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, Nike CEO John Donahoe, Sony CEO Ken Yoshida, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Disney CEO Bob Iger.<br/>
<br/>
The Sun Valley event is invite-only and members of the media have limited access, so the deals and relationships that originate at the event often go undocumented.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/12/tim-cook-sun-valley-2024/">Apple CEO Tim Cook and Software Chief Eddy Cue Attend Sun Valley Conference</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-and-software-chief-eddy-cue-attend-sun-valley-conference.2431225/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently shared Suerte, a new short film that was shot entirely on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. The film follows singer-songwriter Iván Cornejo, known for albums Alma Vacía, Dañado, and Mirada.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Shot on iPhone 15 Pro ¡Suerte! Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dexkYvIch3s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
In the film, Cornejo goes on a journey to Mexico to seek inspiration from his roots for a new hit, and he ends up on a great adventure. His song "Intercambio Injusto" is included, and there is a soundtrack for the film <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/suerte/pl.58ca7a21232544cc941f07aabbaf13a6">available on Apple Music</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is Apple's current flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, featuring a 48-megapixel Main camera, a 12-megapixel Telephoto camera, and a 12-megapixel Telephoto camera with tetraprism technology that allows for up to 5x optical zoom. Apple also shared a "Behind the Scenes" film for Suerte, where directing duo Cliqua explains how it was shot.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Shot on iPhone 15 Pro The making of " src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zF6pTNSGph4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Many of the scenes in the film used no equipment other than the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, with the directors praising Cinematic Mode, a feature that keeps the focus on the main subject that's being filmed even as the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; holder moves. The 5x Telephoto zoom feature was also used for several shots, as was log encoding, an option for ProRes video that allows for improved post-production color grading.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has a long history of sharing Shot on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; photos and videos to show off the features of the cameras in its devices. In recent years, as camera technology has improved, Apple has been sharing short films on a regular basis.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shot-on-iphone/">Shot on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/12/apple-shot-on-iphone-suerte/">Apple Shares &#039;Suerte&#039; Shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max Short Film</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-suerte-shot-on-iphone-15-pro-max-short-film.2431223/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.lululook.com">Lululook</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> and a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Wireless-Foldable-Charging-Aluminum%2Fdp%2FB0CGVFKM5M%2F">Lululook 3-in-1 Charger</a> to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-3-in-1-charger-1.jpg" alt="" width="1765" height="993" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958632" /><br/>
Lululook has a range of Apple device charging options, and the &#36;65 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Wireless-Foldable-Charging-Aluminum%2Fdp%2FB0CGVFKM5M%2F">3-in-1 Wireless Charger</a> can charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple Watch, and AirPods at the same time, so it's a useful desktop or nightstand charger.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-3-in-1-charger-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="2000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958633" /><br/>
Available in gray, black, and silver, the charger is made from aluminum so it matches well with Apple devices. When not in use, it folds down into a compact cube shape, which is ideal for travel. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; attaches to the charger magnetically, but note that charging is limited to 7.5W as this is not <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> or Qi2.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-3-in-1-charger-3.jpg" alt="" width="1940" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958634" /><br/>
The Apple Watch charger is 5W so it can fast charge an Apple Watch, and there is an additional 5W charger for the AirPods and other devices. It also comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable for powering it, but you'll need to supply a power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
If you only need to charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch, Lululook also has a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Foldable-Wireless-Portable-Charging%2Fdp%2FB0CDWNNBC4%2F%3Fth%3D1">foldable 2-in-1 Wireless Charger</a> for just &#36;36. The 2-in-1 Charger has the same design as the 3-in-1 model, but with only two foldable platforms rather than three. It too is able to fast charge the Apple Watch and charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at 7.5W.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-2-in-1-charger-2.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="1256" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958635" /><br/>
Along with chargers, Lululook has a selection of Apple Watch bands for the Apple Watch Ultra and other devices. The <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Original-Fluoroelastomer-Wristband-Replacement%2Fdp%2FB0D3V37G87%2F">&#36;40 fluoroelastomer band</a> is similar to Apple's Sport Band, but it is available in a range of fun colors, including glow-in-the-dark. It is ideal for sports and similar activities because it is washable, sweat resistant, and breathable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-titanium-band-1.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="842" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958636" /><br/>
Lululook has a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Titanium-Adjustable-Smartwatch-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0D5YF5PTX%2F">&#36;120 Titanium Magnetic Band</a> for those who want a band made from the same material that the Apple Watch is made from, and an <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Titanium-Magnetic-Resistant-Size-Lightweight%2Fdp%2FB0CTJKC7G5%2F">upgraded luxury version for &#36;300</a>. The higher-end model is made from Titanium Grade 4, so it is lightweight, comfortable, and durable. It has a double magnetic buckle and a super scratch resistant coating.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-titanium-band-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958637" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/samsungs-latest-challenge-to-apple/id1602394741?i=1000662035949">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss all of the major new device announcements from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-flip6/">Samsung's 2024 Galaxy Unpacked event</a> and how they compare to Apple's offerings.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmsPu_ZoYqk?si=U9FmRzNmt7vtux0I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The Galaxy Z Fold6 features a 7.6-inch main screen and a 6.3-inch cover display, both enhanced with a new dual-rail hinge and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for improved durability. It features the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip and includes AI-powered tools like new camera capabilities and on-device language translation. The Galaxy Z Flip6, with its compact form factor, also sports a more durable display, a new camera system with a 50MP wide sensor, and various AI features.<br/>
<br/>
The Galaxy Buds3 and Buds3 Pro earbuds adopt a stem design reminiscent of Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds3 offer active noise cancellation and maintain an open-ear design, while the Galaxy Buds3 Pro include advanced features like adaptive noise control, built-in lights for visual cues, and real-time audio translation. Both models are designed to provide optimized audio quality through internal and external sound analysis. Just like Samsung, Apple is expected to bring active noise cancellation to its standard AirPods later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's smartwatch lineup is refreshed with the Galaxy Watch7, available in 40mm and 44mm sizes. The Galaxy Watch7 is powered by a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> processor, offering enhanced performance and power efficiency. It includes dual-frequency GPS for improved location accuracy and advanced health tracking capabilities, along with new gesture controls. While Apple is rumored to bring sleep apnea detection to the Apple Watch later this year, with the Galaxy Watch7, Samsung has beaten Apple to deliver the feature first. <br/>
<br/>
The Galaxy Watch Ultra is Samsung's new high-end smartwatch, designed for durability and extreme conditions, making it suitable for athletes and adventurers. It features a titanium frame, water resistance up to 100 meters, and the ability to function at a wide range of altitudes. With a battery life of up to 100 hours in power-saving mode, the Watch Ultra includes multi-course workout tracking, advanced heart rate monitoring, and an emergency siren. Its design and feature-set largely mirrors that of the Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Samsung introduced the Galaxy Ring, a health-focused wearable designed to track a variety of metrics, including sleep, heart rate, and skin temperature. Made of titanium and available in nine sizes, the Galaxy Ring offers up to seven days of battery life and does not require a subscription for accessing health data. It provides comprehensive health insights with features like sleep scoring and an overall energy score, and it closely integrates with other Samsung devices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Hackers broke into a cloud platform used by AT&T and accessed the phone records of "nearly all" of its cellular customers, AT&T <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000102979">announced</a> on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ATT-Banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937556" /><br/>
AT&T said the stolen data contains phone numbers of both cellular and landline customers, as well as AT&T records of calls and text messages across a six-month period between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022. <br/>
<br/>
AT&T said some of the stolen data includes more recent records from January 2, 2023 for a smaller, unspecified number of customers, as well as call records of customers with other cellular carriers that rely on AT&T's network.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the records include cell site identification numbers linked to calls and texts, which can be used to work out the approximate location of where a call was made or message sent.<br/>
<br/>
The downloaded data doesn't include the content of any calls or texts, or their time stamps, according to AT&T. It also doesn't have any details such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or other personally identifiable information.<br/>
<br/>
AT&T said it learned of the data breach on April 19, and that it is unrelated to an earlier security incident in March. The company said it does not believe the data is publicly available at this time, and it continues to work with law enforcement to identify and apprehend those involved. At least one person is said to have been arrested.<br/>
<br/>
AT&T told <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/">TechCrunch</a></em> that the most recent compromise of customer records were stolen from the cloud data giant Snowflake during a recent spate of data thefts targeting Snowflake's customers. Other companies that have confirmed stolen data from Snowflake include Ticketmaster, QuoteWizard, and others.<br/>
<br/>
Cybersecurity researchers from incident response firm Mandiant say the hacker group is mostly based in the US and those involved are financially motivated. <br/>
<br/>
AT&T customers concerned about phishing and smishing scams should visit the company's <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000102979">support article</a>, which also includes advice on how to protect yourself from online fraud.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/12/hackers-steal-att-phone-records/">Hackers Steal Phone Records of &#039;Nearly All&#039; AT&amp;T Customers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hackers-steal-phone-records-of-nearly-all-at-t-customers.2431183/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Vision Pro spatial computing headset today arrived at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> locations in the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, and Australia. The device was previously only available in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, mainland China, and the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2394" height="1396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958584" /><br/>
Consumer interest in the &#36;3,499 headset has slowed at home, and Apple will be hoping its new availability in international markets will provide a shot in the arm for ailing sales. The headset has yet to sell 100,000 units in the quarter since it launched in the U.S. in February, according to market tracker IDC.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's first-ever mixed reality headset offers both augmented and virtual reality features, and it is controlled with a combination of your eyes, hands, and voice. Overall, the feedback on the Vision Pro has been varied. Many users appreciate the device's advanced hardware and technology. <br/>
<br/>
However, there are concerns regarding its functionality, the ease of use of the gesture-based controls, and the device's weight and comfort during extended use. Additionally, the general application of VR technology and the limited content available for the device have drawn criticism.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Stores are offering customers free Vision Pro demos on a first-come, first-served basis. It is also possible to reserve a <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/instore-shopping-session">Vision Pro demo online</a>, with slots available over the course of the next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/12/apple-vision-pro-launched-uk-canada-france-germany/">Apple Vision Pro Launches in UK, Canada, France, Germany, and Australia</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-launches-in-uk-canada-france-germany-and-australia.2431178/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple first began offering refurbished versions of the USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil/">earlier this week</a>, but the discounted device was limited to European countries like Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK. It has now expanded to additional countries.<br/>
<br/>
The USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; was introduced in October 2023, shipping out to customers in November. It is similar in design to the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2, but it has a sliding cap with a USB-C port for charging because it is unable to charge magnetically.<br/>
<br/>
To keep the price low, Apple did not include features like Double Tap and pressure sensitivity in the USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, but it does support tilt functionality and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover. As for compatibility, it works with USB-C iPads that run iOS 17.1 or later.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that refurbished products like the USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; undergo fully functionality testing, as well as cleaning and repackaging. Refurbished &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; USB-C models include the same one-year limited warranty as new models.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-us/">Refurbished USB-C Apple Pencil Now Available in U.S. and Canada</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-now-available-in-u-s-and-canada.2431162/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you've been following Apple news and rumors for the last decade, you might remember The Unofficial Apple Weblog, or TUAW. TUAW <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/30/aohell/">was shut down</a> and the site was folded into <em>Engadget</em> way back in 2015, but this month, a zombie TUAW website reappeared.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/tuaw-website.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958574" /><br/>
As it turns out, the TUAW domain name was purchased by a Hong Kong-based advertising agency, and it now hosts stolen content rewritten using AI. TUAW started posting AI-generated content earlier this week, with all of it stolen from sites like <em>MacRumors</em> and <em>9to5Mac</em>.<br/>
<br/>
The new TUAW website takes articles from Apple news sites and runs them through AI to change the wording. There are multiple stolen images that have been lifted from <em>MacRumors</em> for these articles, with the graphics used created by our in-house graphic designer. Shortly after we published <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">an iPhone 17 "Slim" overview</a>, for example, TUAW published an <a href="https://www.tuaw.com/2024/07/05/iphone-17-slim/">almost identical article</a> that uses our stolen imagery and reads like it was run through a thesaurus.<br/>
<br/>
The company that bought TUAW also shamelessly used the names of people who worked at the site many years ago for author bylines, which meant this stolen content looked like it was coming from people <a href="https://mastodon.social/@film_girl/112758216249922551">like Christina Warren</a> and Brett Terpstra.<br/>
<br/>
Warren was able to get her name and the names of other prominent writers removed after publicizing the zombie site on Mastodon, but the AI content remains. TUAW changed the Christina Warren byline on its site to Mary Brown, making other similar generic name changes. There are no actual writers at TUAW, just AI-generated images and biographies to go along with the AI content.<br/>
<br/>
The advertising agency that purchased the TUAW domain name (Web Orange Limited) did not purchase any TUAW content, but went back and generated AI-rewritten versions of archived TUAW articles from archive.org. Thousands of these articles are on the site alongside newly generated AI stories.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that the company that bought the TUAW domain name also purchased the iLounge domain name several years ago and resurrected that site with low-quality content.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://tidbits.com/2024/07/11/tuaw-joins-ilounge-as-an-ai-powered-zombie-site/">TidBITS</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195858/tuaw-unofficial-apple-tech-blog-ai-web-orange-khan">The Verge</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-blog-tuaw-returns-as-an-ai-content-farm-225326136.html">Engadget</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.404media.co/a-beloved-tech-blog-tuaw-is-now-publishing-ai-articles-under-the-names-of-its-old-human-staff/">404Media</a></em>, and other sites have done deep dives into TUAW and the company behind it that are worth checking out. TUAW's owner does not appear to be based in the United States, and it's unclear if TUAW will be taken down even with legal complaints.<br/>
<br/>
Readers of <em>MacRumors</em>, <em>9to5Mac</em>, and other tech sites will want to avoid TUAW going forward. As <em>TidBITS</em> points out, Google is a major factor in what's going on with TUAW because it isn't de-incentivizing AI-generated content, even on a site where it's almost all AI content. TUAW articles are showing up on the first page of search results alongside legitimate tech sites.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/tuaw-stolen-graphics-ai-content/">Apple Blog TUAW Returns With Stolen Graphics and AI-Generated Content</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-blog-tuaw-returns-with-stolen-graphics-and-ai-generated-content.2431156/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> uses the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> every day, according to an interview he did with <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tech/11893606/apple-vision-pro-tim-cook-interview/">The Sun</a></em> to highlight the headset's launch in the UK. Cook said that he uses the Vision Pro "in all aspects of [his] daily life."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
For specifics, Cook said he used the headset to watch Ted Lasso season three, and that he also watches other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> content using the headset.<blockquote>And so the ability for me to get in the position that I want to get in – including lying flat and putting the screen on the ceiling – is an incredible kind of experience. And of course, it's a 100ft screen. I mean, it's amazing the level of entertainment that it delivers.</blockquote>Cook went on to say that he feels multitasking is "so much more efficient" on Vision Pro because of the support for multiple windows that can be placed in the wearer's physical space.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro experience is hard to explain, said Cook, who recommended that potential customers get a demo. "It's hard to explain it in words," Cook said. "It's hard to show it in a 2D fashion, what a 3D experience will be." At the same time, Cook believes it's simple to use the headset with the gestures that work "the way your mind works." If you can use an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, you can "very easily" use Vision Pro, according to Cook.<br/>
<br/>
According to Cook, some who go through the demo experience find it to be emotional, specifically in reference to viewing spatial photos and videos that allow users to relive memories. "It's interesting to watch people, the reaction that they have," he said. "You know many of them tear up."<br/>
<br/>
Designing the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; required Apple to file more than 5,000 patents, Cook explained, before lauding the Vision Pro team. "I'm so proud of the total, and the perseverance of the team because this was multiple years in the making."<br/>
<br/>
Cook's full interview <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tech/11893606/apple-vision-pro-tim-cook-interview/">can be read at <em>The Sun</em>'s website</a>. The &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; is launching in the UK, Canada, France, Germany, and Australia tomorrow, with demos set to be available in Apple retail stores.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cook/">Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/tim-cook-talks-vision-pro/">Apple CEO Tim Cook Uses Vision Pro Every Day</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-uses-vision-pro-every-day.2431154/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
