		<description><![CDATA[Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1903469694159642784">reiterated</a> that the A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/a20-chip-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995953" /><br/>
Kuo said TSMC's trial production of 2nm chips has now reached yields well above the 60-70% range. The yield refers to the percentage of functional chips that can be obtained per silicon wafer, which is essentially a large, circular disc of chips.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo first said that the A20 chip would be 2nm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/kuo-iphone-17-3nm-chips/">around six months ago</a>, and another analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/iphone-18-a20-chip-2nm-rumor/">said likewise earlier this week</a>.<br/>
<br/>
An earlier rumor saying the A20 chip would remain 3nm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/a20-chip-still-3nm-rumor/">was retracted</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This is ultimately good news, as the A20 chip being 2nm instead of 3nm means it will have more substantial performance and power efficiency improvements over the A19 chip for iPhone 17 models. Kuo, Pu, and others have all said that the A19 chip will be manufactured <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/kuo-iphone-17-3nm-chips/">with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process</a>, called N3P.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, A20 chips should be up to 15% faster and up to 30% more power efficient than A19 chips.<br/>
<br/>
An overview of current and expected chips:<ul><li>A17 Pro chip: 3nm (TSMC's first-generation 3nm process N3B)</li><br/>
<li>A18 and A18 Pro chips: 3nm (TSMC's second-generation 3nm process N3E)</li><br/>
<li>A19 and A19 Pro chips: 3nm (TSMC's third-generation 3m process N3P)</li><br/>
<li>A20 and A20 Pro chips: 2nm (TSMC's first-generation 2nm process N2)</li></ul>iPhone 18 models are still a year and a half away from launching.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/kuo-a20-chip-2nm/">Kuo: iPhone 18 Models Will Feature 2nm Chips</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-18-models-will-feature-2nm-chips.2453846/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple continues to explore the idea of adding tiny cameras to future AirPods, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-866123" /><br/>
Gurman briefly reiterated this possibility in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/apple-vision-pro-chief-mike-rockwell-named-siri-head-giannandrea-keeps-ai-role">report this week</a> about Apple executive Mike Rockwell <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/">becoming the new head of Siri development</a>:<blockquote>Rockwell's experience with hardware also could help the company more deeply embed AI into its future devices. Already, the company is exploring the idea of AirPods with outward-facing cameras that could feed data to AI.</blockquote>The cameras would technically be infrared sensors.<br/>
<br/>
In a June 2024 blog post, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple planned to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/">mass produce new AirPods with infrared cameras by 2026</a>. He said the infrared camera component would be similar to the iPhone's Face ID receiver.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the new AirPods with infrared cameras would provide an enhanced spatial audio experience with Apple's Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
"For example, when a user is watching a video with Vision Pro and wearing this new AirPods, if users turn their heads to look in a specific direction, the sound source in that direction can be emphasized to enhance the spatial audio/computing experience," wrote Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
The infrared cameras could potentially enable "in-air gesture control" as well, allowing for device interaction with hand movements.<br/>
<br/>
If the alleged 2026 mass production timeframe remains on schedule, the new AirPods with infrared cameras could launch in 2026 or 2027.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/apple-still-exploring-airpods-with-cameras/">Apple Still Planning AirPods With Tiny Cameras</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-planning-airpods-with-tiny-cameras.2453842/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon has a few discounts on Apple's 11th generation iPad this weekend, including all-time low prices on each of the three Wi-Fi configurations of the tablet. Prices start at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZ77D5HL%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;328.86</strong></a> for the 128GB Wi-Fi iPad, down from &#36;349.00.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This sale is available in Silver and Blue, while Pink and Yellow are just a few cents higher. Although this is just a &#36;20 discount, it remains the lowest price we've ever tracked for the new iPad, and right now only Amazon has these record low prices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With a bit of a lull in Apple product news following the launches of the latest Mac, iPad, and iPhone updates for early 2025, attention is turning back to rumors about other upcoming products with the all-new "iPhone 17 Air" for later this year and even next year's iPhone 18 Pro seeing some recent rumors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/top-stories-2025-03-22.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996090" /><br/>
Apple is also still getting attention for its delay announcement around the forthcoming Siri update based on Apple Intelligence, with the company seeking to generate some fresh energy for the project by bringing in new leadership, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Ultra-Thin 'iPhone 17 Air' Rumored to Include These 12 Features</h2><br/>
Rumors and leaks indicate we're getting a new iPhone model this year, with an "iPhone 17 Air" replacing the Plus model that's been in the lineup for past several years and coming in at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/">around the same &#36;899 starting price point</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iPhone-17-Air-Size-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993585" /><br/>
While the device is expected to have an impressively thin and light design, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/15/ultra-thin-iphone-17-rumors/">rumors suggest it will have some compromises</a> compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, a single speaker, and an A19 chip instead of a more powerful A19 Pro chip.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly include a 6.6-inch display, and while Apple reportedly prototyped a larger model with a 6.9-inch screen, the company is said to have decided against it due to concerns over an ultra-thin form factor at that size <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/larger-iphone-17-air-referred-to-prototype/">being susceptible to bending</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro Creator Taking Over Siri After Apple Intelligence Setbacks</h2><br/>
Fallout from delays to a Siri revamp powered by Apple Intelligence and subsequent criticisms of some of the company's actions continues to mount, with Apple moving to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/">shift responsibility for Siri from its AI chief John Giannandrea to former Vision Pro boss Mike Rockwell</a> in an effort to shake things up.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Sad-Siri-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994723" /><br/>
The move comes as the current version of Siri is under renewed criticism for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/siri-is-still-bad/">difficulties handling even some of the most basic queries</a>. Prominent industry analyst Benedict Evans wonders if the Apple Intelligence issues and the push to bring Vision Pro to market are a sign of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/apples-windows-vista-moment/">Apple experiencing a "Vista-like drift into systemically poor execution"</a> similar to what Microsoft went through with Windows nearly 20 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Report: Apple TV+ Losing &#36;1 Billion Annually as Apple Services Falter</h2><br/>
Apple is known to have been investing large sums of money into Apple TV+ in an effort to expand its services business, but it's never been revealed how well the service is performing for Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-TV-Plus-Feature-2-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959291" /><br/>
A new report from <em>The Information</em> claims that Apple TV+ has around 45 million subscribers worldwide, making it a small player in the streaming video market, and that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/report-tv-losing-1-billion-annually/">the service is losing roughly &#36;1 billion per year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly been trying to tighten up the purse strings a bit to move closer to breaking even on Apple TV+, but it's not the only Apple service that's not exactly pulling its weight in the high-margin services sector, as Apple Music interest seems to be plateauing while Apple News+, Apple Arcade, and Apple Fitness+ are also not seeing significant growth.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next Year's iPhone 18 Pro Already Rumored to Have Five New Features</h2><br/>
We're still nearly six months away from the official unveiling of the iPhone 17 lineup, but that doesn't mean the rumor mill isn't already looking beyond to the 2026 models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-ghost-hand.jpg" alt="" width="1785" height="1004" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-966100" /><br/>
For <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/iphone-18-pro-rumors/">Apple's high-end iPhone 18 Pro models</a>, rumors have suggested we could see under-display Face ID for a much smaller Dynamic Island, a variable aperture main camera, Apple's next-generation C2 cellular modem, and an A20 chip with upgrades to benefit Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's First Foldable iPhone Estimated to Cost Nearly Twice as Much as iPhone 16 Pro Max</h2><br/>
Apple has been rumored to be working on several foldable devices, with a foldable iPhone potentially being the first one out the door in late 2026 or early 2027. Based on supply chain checks, Barclays analyst Tim Long <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/foldable-iphone-price-estimate/">believes the device could start at around &#36;2,300</a>, representing a huge premium over Apple's traditional flagship phones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Iridescent-Search.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995557" /><br/>
A larger foldable device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">may not be far behind</a>, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/apple-foldable-ipad-or-mac/">will it be considered a Mac or an iPad</a>? It may largely come down to whether its operating system is built off of iPadOS or macOS, with analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/">believing it will be a flavor of macOS</a>.<br/>

If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> that supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, iOS 18.4 adds support for Priority Notifications, one of the features that Apple announced when introducing &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; at the June 2024 WWDC event.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991317" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/prioritize-notifications-ios-18-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Priority Notifications display your most important messages first, highlighting them in a special section on the Lock Screen. Apple uses &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; to decide which notifications deserve priority status, and it's typically messages notifications that need to be viewed or responded to imminently.<br/>
<br/>
Upcoming deliveries are highlighted, for example, as are meetings that are happening, calendar alerts for events that are coming up that day, reminders that are due, and messages that look like they need a quick response, such as a dinner invitation.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992532" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-prioritize-notifications.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Priority Notifications can be turned on for all apps, or set up on a per-app basis in the Notifications section of the Settings app. In the beta, Priority Notifications is not on by default, and it needs to be enabled, but that could change before iOS 18.4 is released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also adding new languages to &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; in iOS 18.4, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified), along with localized English for Singapore and India.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Visual Intelligence Updates</h2><br/>
For <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro users, iOS 18.4 brings <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a>, a feature that was previously limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. Apple initially limited &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; to iPhones with a Camera Control button, but with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, Apple added an Action Button activation option, and that's what's used for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro, too.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970984" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Visual-Intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
&zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; can be activated by linking it to the Action Button, but there's also a new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; section in Control Center that includes a &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; button as an alternative way to launch it.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992533" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-visual-intelligence-action-button.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
The Action Button and Control Center options for &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; can also be used on &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, so if you have an &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and don't like the Camera Control long press to activate &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj;, you can now use these alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992503" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-control-center-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Emoji</h2><br/>
There are a handful of new emoji characters that are available in iOS 18.4, and that's always a big deal for emoji fans. The new emoji characters include bags under eyes, fingerprint, leafless tree, root vegetable, harp, shovel, and splatter.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992499" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18.4-Emoji-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Ambient Music</h2><br/>
iOS 18.4 has an Ambient Music toggle that can be added to Control Center. You can choose from four different sound categories, including Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing. Selecting one of the Ambient Music categories plays a random selection of sounds or music from that category.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991311" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-ambient-music.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
There is no dedicated Ambient Music app and you can't choose what's playing from Control Center, but if you play a category and then tap into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> at the top or access the Now Playing widget, you can skip songs and see the name of what's playing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Store Downloads</h2><br/>
In iOS 18.4, when you download an app from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, you can pause the download right from the update list. It's a small change, but one that is useful if you're in a situation where you have low signal and need to do something else while an app download is in progress.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992535" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-app-store-pause-download.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Before now, you could only stop and restart an app installation from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; interface.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also added &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; review summaries, which makes it easier to see what people think of an app at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993504" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/app-store-review-summaries.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bonus for Vision Pro Users: Guest Mode Controls</h2><br/>
Apple added an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; app for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> in iOS 18.4, and it can be used to view info about the Vision Pro, find content to watch, and download apps to the headset. Overall, it's not super exciting.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992487" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/vision-pro-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
What is useful, though, is an option to control Guest Mode from your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; if someone is using your Vision Pro. When someone that isn't you picks up your Vision Pro and puts it on, you'll see a pop up on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. From there, you can choose what apps and experiences the person will view, and you can use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> mode to guide them through their Vision Pro experience.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Features</h2><br/>
For a full list of all the features we've found in iOS 18.4 so far, make sure to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-4-features/">check out our iOS 18.4 roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Launch Date</h2><br/>
We're on the fourth beta of iOS 18.4, and there are likely a couple more to go. Apple plans to release iOS 18.4 in early April alongside iPadOS 18.4 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.4.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/ios-18-4-top-5-features/">Top 5 New Features Coming in iOS 18.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-5-new-features-coming-in-ios-18-4.2453793/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A rare, operational Apple-1 Computer was recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/apple-1-apple-prototypes-auction/">put up for auction</a>, and it ended up selling for &#36;375,000. The Apple-1 was the first computer sold by Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, and so few remain that they fetch high prices at auction.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992136" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-1-rr-auction.jpg" alt="" width="2164" height="1216" /><br/>
The Apple-1 that sold is known as the "Bayville" Apple-1, and it is number 91 on <a href="https://www.apple1registry.com">the Apple-1 Registry</a>. The Apple-1 Registry aggregates all known remaining Apple-1 computers, and it includes details and a history for each one. The registry has 104 Apple-1 machines listed.<br/>
<br/>
The Bayville Apple-1 was part of the first batch of Apple-1 machines sold in 1976, and it has a handwritten serial number that was likely penned by Steve Jobs. It was sold with an original manual with a handwritten note by Daniel Kottke, who was Apple employee number 12.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple-1 was sold alongside many other Apple-related items as part of a "Steve Jobs and the Apple Revolution" auction event. A 1976 Apple Computer check signed by Steve Jobs sold for &#36;112,054, and a sealed, first-generation 4GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sold for &#36;87,514.<br/>
<br/>

Another check signed by Steve Jobs sold for &#36;62,500, and an Apple Lisa Computer sold for &#36;56,818.

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://astropad.com">Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an 11-inch M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, and <a href="https://astropad.com/product/rock-paper-pencil/">Astropad's Rock Paper Pencil kit</a> to go with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/rock-paper-pencil-2025-ipads.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996117" /><br/>
If you want to draw, sketch, or take notes on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, the Rock Paper Pencil kit is a must have. It's the best way to match the feel of writing on paper, and it makes using an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as a writing surface much more pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985902" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-3.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
Rock Paper Pencil is an all-in-one kit that includes a textured screen protector and a special tip that connects to the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. This combination turns the glossy, unnatural feel of writing on an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; into a natural, paper-like experience. Not only does it feel like writing on paper, it <em>sounds</em> like writing on paper, plus you get more control over stroke output because of the friction from the added texture.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985903" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-4.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
Astropad's screen protector uses NanoCling technology to adhere to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with static cling, and you can put it on and take it off as needed with zero residue on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display. With the NanoCling technology, the screen protector fits right up against the display of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, providing a flat surface with no ridges or gaps.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985904" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-5.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
Rock Paper Pencil's tip fits on the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro and other &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models, and it is able to hold up to heavy daily use. It has a wear-resistant copper alloy core with a palladium exterior coating, and the size is equivalent to an 0.7mm ballpoint pen for precision writing and sketching. You get two pencil tips with the kit, along with a protective storage sleeve so you can tuck away the screen protector when you're not using it.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985901" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
Available for &#36;45, the Rock Paper Pencil kit is compatible with Apple's new M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models, and it is also compatible with other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models. It works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, the sixth and seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> models, and the 7th-generation and later &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985905" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-6.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> joins us on this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/mark-gurman-talks-apple-intelligence-fallout-and-ios/id1602394741?i=1000700280810">The MacRumors Show</a> to discuss the controversy surrounding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, what to expect from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WP64aRs1efU?si=mulRxcSoAtRWXOQD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
With the context of his insider knowledge, Mark gives us his thoughts on Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">recent announcement</a> that it is further delaying the major <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that it expected to release as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. He gives us a sense of the scale of the crisis and when to expect the remaining features to arrive. We also discuss his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/">recent report</a> about a significant internal reshuffle to move &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; from artificial intelligence chief John Giannandrea to Vision Pro chief Mike Rockwell.<br/>
<br/>
We delve into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-believes-users-love-major-ios-19-redesign/">complete redesign</a> rumored for &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;, which is believed to be part of a wider push to bring a visionOS-style design language to all of Apple's major platforms. It is expected to be the biggest redesign of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s software since iOS 7. Mark tells us what users are likely to make of the update and why Apple is devoting so much energy to the redesign amid the problems with &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;. He also tells us about the sort of new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features to expect in &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; and the plan to progressively improve &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; through to iOS 20.<br/>
<br/>
We discuss why the delay in releasing the remaining &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features has delayed the company's long-rumored smart home hub product and the experience it is expected to offer when it launches later this year. We also touch on Apple's problems with allocating developer resources, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17-exclusive &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features, whether Apple is doing enough to course-correct on AI, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ viewing habits, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A few years ago, the American automaker General Motors (GM) announced that it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/">phasing out support for CarPlay</a> and Android Auto in its new electric vehicles, in favor of its own software platform. It was a controversial decision, as many drivers who are in the market for a new vehicle consider CarPlay to be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/apple-carplay-jd-power-study/">must-have feature</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/CarPlay-GM-EV.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996106" /><br/>
Looking to capitalize on the situation, one GM dealership near Detroit, Michigan last year partnered with a third party to offer an aftermarket CarPlay installation service in GM's newer EV models. But, according to a report this week from <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/gm-just-shut-down-the-only-apple-carplay-retrofit-kit-for-its-evs">automotive blog <em>The Drive</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633791/gm-apple-carplay-retrofit-shut-down"><em>The Verge</em></a>), GM recently blocked the dealership from offering that service due to safety concerns.<br/>
<br/>
"We have made the difficult decision to discontinue this product," said White Automotive & Media Services, <a href="https://www.whiteautoandmedia.com/product/carplay-and-android-auto-upgrade-for-ultium-evs/">on its website</a> that previously offered the CarPlay installation service. "This was not a decision we made lightly, but due to a variety of factors, continuing to offer this product is no longer viable in the long term," it said.<br/>
<br/>
A spokesperson for GM told <em>The Drive</em> that unapproved aftermarket services "could affect critical safety features," and pose other issues.<br/>
<br/>
"Aftermarket services that introduce features not originally designed, thoroughly tested, and approved by GM may cause unintended issues for customers," the GM spokesperson said, in response to this matter. "These issues could affect critical safety features and may also void portions of the vehicle's warranty."<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if the aftermarket CarPlay system actually poses any safety issues, or if GM is simply unhappy that one dealership decided to go against the company's decision to focus on its own software platform. It is also unclear if customers who already had the installation service completed will be affected in any way.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> A source connected to GM told us that the aftermarket CarPlay installation impacted critical vehicle functions and vehicle performance, and they said that future software updates might break CarPlay functionality.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/general-motors/">General Motors</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/gm-blocks-aftermarket-carplay/">GM Reportedly Blocks Dealership From Installing CarPlay in Newer EVs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gm-reportedly-blocks-dealership-from-installing-carplay-in-newer-evs.2453753/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anthropic has finally added web search capabilities to Claude 3.7 Sonnet, allowing the AI chatbot to access up-to-date information beyond its knowledge cutoff date of October 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/claude-ai.jpeg" alt="" width="960" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948972" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search">Announced on Thursday</a>, the new feature enables Claude to search the internet for current events and information, so its accuracy should be significantly better when answering questions about recent developments.<br/>
<br/>
When Claude uses web search to inform its responses, the interface provides clickable citations that allow you to verify sources and fact-check information, meaning you won't have to conduct separate searches.<br/>
<br/>
The feature is currently available only to paying subscribers in the United States. Anthropic says it plans to roll out web search to free users and additional countries "soon," but the company gave no specific timeline.<br/>
<br/>
Web search functionality has become a standard feature among leading AI chatbots. OpenAI began introducing ChatGPT Search to paying subscribers last fall and eventually made the feature available to all users – including those without a ChatGPT account – early <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/chatgpt-search-without-an-account/">last month</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Anthropic is pitching the web search function as particularly valuable for professionals across various fields. The company suggests sales teams can use it to analyze industry trends, financial analysts can assess current market data, and researchers can build stronger literature reviews by searching across primary sources.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/claude-web-search.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996054" /><br/>
For everyday users, the feature also promises to simplify comparison shopping by evaluating product features, prices, and reviews from multiple sources simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
Paying Claude users in the US can access web search by enabling the feature through their profile settings menu. The functionality is currently limited to Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which is Anthropic's first "hybrid reasoning model" capable of both quick responses and step-by-step problem solving.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/anthropic/">Anthropic</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/anthropic-claude-gets-web-search/">Anthropic&#039;s Claude Finally Gets Web Search, Months After ChatGPT</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anthropics-claude-finally-gets-web-search-months-after-chatgpt.2453685/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Threads has just introduced several new features aimed at giving users more control over their experience and enhancing content discovery on the social media platform and X rival.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/instagram-threads-app.jpg" alt="" width="1079" height="607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902359" /><br/>
The update includes the ability to add up to ten "Topics" to your bio, which can be used to showcase your interests and connect with like-minded users. When someone visits your profile, the topics will be prominently displayed and can be tapped to view related conversations. Meta says this feature is a test, so it might not be around for ever.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, for content creators, Threads is now suggesting trending topics when drafting posts. According to Meta's internal data, posts with tagged topics generally receive more views than those without, so this could potentially offer a boost to creator reach and engagement.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/threads_Profile-tags-updated-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1672" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996046" /><br/>
The platform is also expanding its privacy controls. Users can now restrict replies and quote posts to followers only, building on the Quote Controls feature introduced last November. Meta says the aim is to give users more granular control over who can engage with their content.<br/>
<br/>
Video consumption is also getting an upgrade with a more sophisticated media player. Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/new-threads-features-more-personalized-experience-you-control/">says</a> the improved interface includes new pause, play, and skip buttons, along with a pinned progress bar that allows users to navigate more easily through video content.<br/>
<br/>

And in a policy shift, Threads is beginning to reintroduce political content to the platform "in a more personalized way," following their previous announcement about changing how civic content appears in feeds.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, users will also gain the ability to customize the order of their feeds, including setting a custom feed as the default view when opening the app.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/">Threads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/threads-update-adds-profile-topics/">Threads Update Adds Profile Topics and Follower-Only Replies</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-update-adds-profile-topics-and-follower-only-replies.2453680/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google is rolling out an improved Gmail search function powered by AI that the company <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-search-update-relevant-emails/">reckons</a> will "show you the most relevant results, faster."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/gmail-icon.png" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-854189" /><br/>
Search in Gmail has traditionally returned results from your inbox in chronological order based on keywords. That's not great if the email you need was sent months or years ago. <br/>
<br/>
What the new method does to improve things is factor in elements like how often you contact someone, which emails you've clicked the most, and how recently the emails arrived in your inbox.<br/>
<br/>
"With this update, the emails you're looking for are far more likely to be at the top of your search results — saving you valuable time and helping you find important information more easily," claims Google.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/gmail-search-most-relevant-results.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996042" /><br/>
The new "most relevant" search results are rolling out globally for users with personal Google accounts, and are accessible on the web and in the official Gmail app for iOS and Android. If it's appearing for you already, you'll be able to toggle between "most relevant" and "most recent" results. Google says it will expand the new feature to business users in the future.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gmail/">Gmail</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/gmails-search-function-major-upgrade/">Gmail&#039;s Search Function Just Got a Major Upgrade</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gmails-search-function-just-got-a-major-upgrade.2453668/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to use liquid metal in the hinges of its upcoming foldable iPhone to improve durability and reduce screen creasing, <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1902942517861159377">according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Iridescent-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995555" /><br/>
Apple has reportedly chosen liquid metal, which is manufactured using a die-casting process, as a key component in addressing common issues with foldable devices. The design choice aims to enhance screen flatness and minimize the crease marks that typically plague folding displays.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo notes that Apple has previously used liquid metal in smaller components like SIM ejector pins, but the foldable iPhone will mark the company's first major use of the material in a critical mechanical part. Dongguan EonTec will reportedly be the exclusive supplier of liquid metal.<br/>
<br/>
Previous reports suggest Apple's foldable iPhone will feature a 7.8-inch main display when unfolded and a 5.5-inch cover display. The device is expected to adopt a book-style design similar to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold, rather than a clamshell form factor.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">earlier information</a> from Kuo, the foldable iPhone may include two rear cameras, a single front-facing camera, and Touch ID integrated into the power button. The device could measure just 4.5mm thick when unfolded, and between 9mm and 9.5mm when closed.<br/>
<br/>
Mass production is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2026, suggesting a potential launch in late 2026 or early 2027.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/apple-liquid-metal-foldable-iphone-hinges/">Kuo: Foldable iPhone to Feature Liquid Metal Hinges for Better Durability</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-foldable-iphone-to-feature-liquid-metal-hinges-for-better-durability.2453663/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is putting a heavy focus on improving power efficiency while slimming down key components in its upcoming foldable iPhone, with  battery capacity now a key priority for the company, according to a new report citing sources within Apple's supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Homescreen.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995585" /><br/>
According to Korean news aggregator account "<a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223804440906&navType=by">yeux1122</a>" on the Naver blog, which has previously offered accurate insights into Apple's component strategy, Apple is specifically refining the display driver IC (DDI) used in its first foldable iPhone, with the goal of achieving a thinner overall design. <br/>
<br/>
The DDI is a key component that converts digital signals from the device's processor into the analog signals needed to control the display's pixels. Improvements to the DDI can enable thinner panel assemblies, lower heat output, and reduced power consumption – all of which are critical in compact devices like foldables with multiple displays. <br/>
<br/>
Multiple sources now agree on key specifications for Apple's first foldable iPhone, including a 7.8-inch main display when unfolded and a 5.5-inch cover display. The consensus comes from analysts <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/">Jeff Pu</a>, as well as the Weibo leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/">Digital Chat Station</a>. The agreement on the details suggest Apple may have finalized significant aspects of the device's hardware.<br/>
<br/>
According to Kuo, the foldable iPhone will adopt a book-style design, opening horizontally like a Galaxy Z Fold, rather than the vertical clamshell form factor of Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip.<br/>
<br/>
Jeff Pu reports that the device has recently entered the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">New Product Introduction (NPI) phase</a> at Foxconn, a key stage in Apple's production timeline. Both Pu and Kuo anticipate mass production beginning in the fourth quarter of 2026, which opens the possibility of a limited launch as early as next year.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of hardware, Kuo claims the foldable iPhone will feature two rear cameras, a single front-facing camera, and a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button –suggesting Apple may skip Face ID for this model, likely to save internal space. It's expected to include a high-density battery and a titanium chassis, with the hinge constructed from a combination of titanium and stainless steel.<br/>
<br/>
As for dimensions, Kuo believes the device will measure just 4.5mm thick when unfolded, and between 9mm and 9.5mm when closed, making it notably thin compared to current foldables.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's efforts to optimize hardware efficiency across its product lines are already in motion, with the iPhone 16e featuring its first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">custom-made C1 modem</a>. Apple said the C1 modem is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/">most power-efficient iPhone modem ever</a>, and it has held up fine in both real-world and simulated 5G <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-c1-modem-5g-speed-tests/">speed test results</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is on a mission to make the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/">thinnest possible devices</a> in each product category, beginning with the most recent iPad Pro and continuing later this year with the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, which is expected to be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">second device to use the C1 modem</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/foldable-iphone-impressive-battery-life-thinness/">Foldable iPhone to Feature Impressive Battery Life Despite Thinness</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-to-feature-impressive-battery-life-despite-thinness.2453662/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Across 2024 and the early months of 2025, Apple refreshed all of its Macs with next-generation M4 chips, with the exception of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>. The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; is still waiting for an update, but it is supposed to get an overhaul later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Mac-Pro-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-880543" /><br/>
<h2>M-Series Chip</h2><br/>
The current version of the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; can be purchased with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Ultra chip, which came out in June 2023. It might seem logical for the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; to get the equivalent M4 chip, the M4 Ultra, but it turns out Apple might not have an M4 Ultra in the works.<br/>
<br/>
When the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> was updated earlier this month, Apple announced a version with the M4 Max chip, and a version with an M3 Ultra chip, with no M4 Ultra unveiled. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-explains-lack-of-m4-ultra-chip/">told Mac Studio reviewers</a> that not every generation of M-series chips will include a higher-end "Ultra" tier, so there may simply be no M4 Ultra that exists for the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There's now a question over what chip Apple will use in the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;, and there are a few possibilities.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Apple does have an M4 Ultra chip coming, and it's not ready yet.</li><br/>
 	<li>There's some version of a high-end M4 chip that is not technically an "Ultra" chip and is instead called something else like "M4 Extreme."</li><br/>
 	<li>The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will use the M3 Ultra chip.</li><br/>
 	<li>The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will get an M5 Ultra chip.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-ultra/">M1 Ultra</a>, &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra, and M3 Ultra chips that Apple has released have essentially been two Max chips linked together through an "UltraFusion" connector. The M4 Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-confirms-m4-max-lacks-ultrafusion/">does not have the UltraFusion</a> connector available, so the first possibility seems unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could be making an M4 Ultra or Extreme chip that is standalone and not a doubled up variant of the M4 Max, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/m4-ultra-chip-is-unlikely/">recently claimed</a> that Apple doesn't want to create an M4 Ultra chip from scratch because of costs, production challenges, and low sales of high-end and expensive machines.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could refresh the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; with the same M3 Ultra chip that it put in the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, but if that's Apple's plan, it's likely the company would have just refreshed the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; alongside the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;. The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; could be held back for other development reasons, but there aren't really rumors of notable new features coming.<br/>
<br/>
We might be getting the first Macs with M5 chips later this year, but there's also a chance M5 Macs won't come until early 2026. Even if Macs with M5 chips do launch in late 2025, there's no guarantee that an Ultra version of the chip will be ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, there's no clear indication of what's in store for the 2025 &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;'s Apple silicon chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design</h2><br/>
There aren't rumors of design updates for the next &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;, so it's not likely that Apple has anything planned.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Ports</h2><br/>
Apple added Thunderbolt 5 to the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, so the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will likely get Thunderbolt 5 ports too. Thunderbolt 5 will allow for more high-resolution displays to be connected to the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;.<br/>

<h2>RAM and SSD</h2><br/>
The M3 Ultra chip supports up to 512GB RAM, so if the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; gets the M3 Ultra or something similar, it will support a lot more RAM. The current model is limited to 192GB.<br/>
<br/>
Storage maximums will also double, as the M3 Ultra supports up to a 16TB SSD, while the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; is limited to 8TB.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Launch Date</h2><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; said last year that the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will see a refresh <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/">toward the end of 2025</a>, but given the chip uncertainty, Apple could be planning to hold it until 2026.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro">Mac Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1">Mac Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/mac-pro-2025-rumors/">Apple&#039;s Last M4 Mac: What&#039;s Rumored for the Mac Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-last-m4-mac-whats-rumored-for-the-mac-pro.2453617/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has been accused of false advertising and unfair competition for delaying the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features that it promoted when launching <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, reports <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/20/apple-suit-false-advertising-ai-intelligence"><em>Axios</em></a>.<br/>

The suit targets Apple ads that showed off &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that were unavailable, and claims that Apple cultivated "a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s release," while also driving "unprecedented excitement" that convinced millions consumers to upgrade their devices when the upgrades were not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
After confirming that the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features would be delayed until the coming year, Apple removed the ads, but that was after they had been running for several months. Apple is accused of advertising functionality that did not exist, and continuing to promote the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities well after the company was aware that they would not be available on time.<br/>
<blockquote>Contrary to Defendant's claims of advanced AI capabilities, the Products offered a significantly limited or entirely absent version of Apple Intelligence, misleading consumers about its actual utility and performance. Worse yet, Defendant promoted its Products based on these overstated AI capabilities, leading consumers to believe they were purchasing a device with features that did not exist or were materially misrepresented.</blockquote><br/>
The lawsuit was filed in a San Jose, California court and the plaintiffs are seeking class action status along with damages for customers who purchased an Apple device that supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/apple-intelligence-siri-lawsuit/">Apple Facing False Advertising Lawsuit Over Apple Intelligence Delay</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-facing-false-advertising-lawsuit-over-apple-intelligence-delay.2453616/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Episode 10 of season 2 will have the longest runtime of any episode so far, coming in at 76 minutes.<br/>
<br/>

Tonight's season finale will wrap up the season 2 storyline and provide some insight into just what the Macrodata Refinement department does and what "Cold Harbor" really is. A <a href="https://x.com/AppleTV/status/1901997043377127918">brief teaser</a> for episode that Apple shared on social media highlighted one of the goats, so we might also learn what Lumon's Mammalians Nurturable team does with them.<br/>
<br/>
Severance has become one of Apple's most talked about shows, and it has spawned countless fan theories, with viewers speculating about what's going on after every episode.<br/>
<br/>
In an interview yesterday, Ben Stiller said that work is underway on Severance season 3, and this time around, we won't have to wait three years for more episodes.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/severance-season-2-finale/">Severance Season 2 Finale is Tonight</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/severance-season-2-finale-is-tonight.2453613/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
