		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to bring select retail store employees to Cupertino, California in early 2024 to learn about the Vision Pro headset ahead of the device's launch, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">Mark Gurman reports</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Vision-Pro-lab.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-907266" /><br/>
Gurman revealed details about the "product training event" in the latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">"Power On" newsletter</a>. Apple apparently recent sent a memo to retail employees asking them to apply for the "secretive" event. Acceptance is dependent on an application and interview process. An extract from the memo reads:<blockquote>Selected team members will travel and participate in an event in Cupertino, California, at some point in the first months of 2024. Upon returning to their home store, they'll deliver training and ongoing support to store team members. This is a group opportunity for those who have a deep passion for demonstrating Apple products and teaching others.</blockquote>Gurman explained that the event seeks to teach employees about the Vision Pro and train them on the complex procedure involved when selling the device to customers. Apple hopes that a couple of members of staff from each retail store in the United States will attend before returning to their local store to teach their colleagues about the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The rollout of the Vision Pro headset is expected to be the most complicated in Apple's history. Apple is planning to assemble customers' Vision Pro headsets in-store, compiling the appropriate headband, light seal, and optional prescription lenses. Flagship retail stores are set to gain dedicated Vision Pro hands-on areas, while other stores will only receive one or two units.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman believes that the memo's wording indicates that the device will not be ready at the very beginning of the new year. Apple simply says that Vision Pro will launch in "early" 2024.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-to-host-secretive-vision-pro-training-event/">Apple to Host &#039;Secretive&#039; Vision Pro Training Event for Retail Staff</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-host-secretive-vision-pro-training-event-for-retail-staff.2408357/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>'s production costs are appreciably higher than those of last year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, marking record high component prices that Apple could pass onto customers in 2024, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/iPhone-15-teardown-reveals-10-costlier-parts-than-2022-flagship"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max is calculated to cost &#36;558, a 12% increase over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max model released in 2022. This is a record high for the total cost of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s components. From 2018 to 2021, the total cost of parts for Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; "Pro Max" models ranged from &#36;400 to &#36;450. Component costs rose around 20% in 2022 before reaching today's record high of &#36;558.<br/>
<br/>
The cost of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max's telephoto camera now stands at &#36;30, a 380% increase over the previous model. Likewise, the titanium frame costs &#36;50, a 43% increase over the stainless steel frame of previous devices. The A17 Pro chip comes in at &#36;130, a 27% increase over the A16 Bionic chip.<br/>
<br/>
The other models in the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup are also not immune to cost increases. The standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;'s components come in at &#36;423, a 16% increase compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus is calculated at &#36;442, a 10% increase over its predecessor, while the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; grew by 8% to &#36;523.<br/>
<br/>
Despite increased costs, Apple did not increase the retail prices of any of its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models this year and chose to absorb the impact of increased expenses. The only notable change was the discontinuation of the 128GB Pro Max model, meaning that users who normally purchased the 128GB model now have to pay &#36;100 more to obtain the device.<br/>
<br/>
In collaboration with <em>Nikkei</em>, Tokyo-based research company Fomalhaut Techno Solutions believes that if Apple continues to absorb the impact of increased production costs, its bottom line will soon take a hit. As a result, Apple may finally choose to hike &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; retail prices upon the launch of next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/">Nikkei</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/record-high-iphone-15-costs/">iPhone 15&#039;s Record High Production Costs Could Push Up iPhone 16 Prices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15s-record-high-production-costs-could-push-up-iphone-16-prices.2408344/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is not planning to launch new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models until around March 2024, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">Mark Gurman claims</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/ipad-air-5-colors.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-839734" /><br/>
In the most recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman explained that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">new Apple Pencil with USB-C</a> comes ahead of an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; refresh in the spring. He added that Apple has been working on the 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, and sixth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> for some time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is apparently planning to release new iPads in March, which will likely "at least" include these three refreshed devices. The next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> is also a possibility, but only the "more minor" &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; updates appear to be locked down for the spring at the current time.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman added that he anticipates that the first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> will be discontinued alongside the ninth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, since there will no longer be any new iPads on sale from Apple with a Lightning connector at that point.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is developing a large array of features that use generative AI, including a new version <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, that could launch next year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840591" /><br/>
In his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman said that despite Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>'s claim that Apple has been working on generative AI technology for years, Apple's executives were "caught off guard" by the industry's sudden interest in AI and have been anxiously "scrambling since late last year to make up for lost time."<br/>
<br/>
Apple's senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy, John Giannandrea, and senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi are apparently leading the company's AI efforts. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a>, Apple's senior vice president of services, is also involved in the push.<br/>
<br/>
Giannandrea is said to be overseeing development of the underlying technologies for a new AI system. Most notably, his team is working on a new, "smarter version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;" that is deeply integrated with AI. Gurman says it could be ready as soon as next year.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Federighi is supervising the integration of AI into to the next major version of iOS by introducing features running on Apple's large language model (LLM). Among the new features is a revamped interaction between &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and the Messages app, enabling users to field complex questions and auto-complete sentences more effectively. Federighi's team is also looking at integrating AI into Xcode to help developers write code more quickly, bringing it in line with services like Microsoft's GitHub Copilot.<br/>
<br/>
Cue is reportedly attempting to add AI to as many Apple apps as possible, including features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, such as auto-generated playlists, and productivity apps like Pages and Keynote, where AI could assist with writing or creating slide decks. Apple is also apparently testing the use of generative AI for internal customer service apps within <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is purportedly on course to spend &#36;1 billion per year on AI research. Whether Apple should deploy generative AI as a completely on-device experience, a cloud-based setup, or a hybrid approach, is currently a source of debate internally.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously reported that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/15/apple-engineers-working-on-chatgpt-like-ai/">working on</a> a chatbot tool that some engineers have dubbed "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-experimenting-with-chatgpt-tool/">Apple GPT</a>" to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">Apple Generative AI Features and Smarter Siri Could Launch Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri-could-launch-next-year.2408328/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning a Mac-focused product launch, likely including the announcement of a refreshed 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, for the end of this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">Mark Gurman reports</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/imac-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-896380" /><br/>
In the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman said that Apple is "planning a Mac-centered product launch around the end of this month" that could see the the release of a refreshed 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; model, which is long overdue a hardware update. The current model launched in April 2021 and it is the only current-generation Mac left with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. Gurman has repeatedly said that Apple's next <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/06/no-m2-imac-on-the-horizon-for-2022/">iMac will skip the M2</a> and feature the M3 chip instead, but he declined to mention which chip the new machine will feature in this newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman noted that Apple retail stores are now in short supply of the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, and many configurations now will not arrive until mid-November, in what he believes is "a clear sign that something is about to happen" regarding these three machines. He added that Apple has "made headway" on new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. While the current, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models launched in January, he thinks that an "additional update the same year would be unusual, but not inconceivable."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman believes that the upcoming Mac announcement will take place on Monday, October 30 or Tuesday, October 31, followed by Apple's earnings call on Thursday, November 2. He does not expect any of the new Macs to feature major changes other than new processors, but mused that there could be minor improvements to their displays.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman also reiterated rumors that next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models with M3 chips will not launch until early 2024 and that a larger "pro" version of the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with a 32-inch display and a new design is tabled for late 2024 or 2025. Mac redesigns are apparently likely to occur when Apple begins adding touchscreens to the lineup further in the future.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/">Gurman: Apple to Announce New Macs This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month.2408323/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

– Handoff playback between your Apple HomePod and iPhone, and vice versa<br/>
– Control playback in the Apple Home app.</blockquote> Support for the option was announced by YouTube Music in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/17cht03/you_can_now_use_youtube_music_on_your_apple/">Reddit post</a> spotted by <em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/10/20/youtube-music-homepod/">9to5Google</a></em>. The update has been expected since September, when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/youtube-music-homepod-integration/">hidden code was revealed in the app</a>.<br/>
<br/>

<li>Tap Use in Home.</li></ol>If you don't see the option in YouTube Music, try force-closing the app and re-opening it.<br/>
<br/>
After you have done that, you will need to select YouTube as the "Default Service" for your &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;(s).<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Home app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.</li><br/>

<br/>
Note that to connect YouTube Music to &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, you will need to have either a YouTube Music or YouTube Premium account.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has supported a handful of third-party music services on ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌ for the last couple of years, and the functionality is already available with Pandora, iHeartRadio, Deezer, and TuneIn Radio.<br/>
<br/>
Other music services including Spotify have not supported this option even though Apple made the SiriKit Media feature available in iOS 14, so it remains limited in scope. With the direct play function, users can set a third-party service as a default music option, and when ‌&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌ on ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌ is asked to play content, ‌&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌ will play music from the selected service.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube-music/">YouTube Music</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/youtube-music-integration-comes-to-homepod/">YouTube Music Integration Comes to HomePod</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-music-integration-comes-to-homepod.2408314/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is rumored to be developing a new HomePod with a screen, and new images shared online allegedly give us a first glimpse of the new smart speaker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/lcd-screen-homepod-kosutami.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918030" /><br/>
The above image appears to show a HomePod similar in size to the second-generation HomePod that was launched earlier this year, but with what appears to be a functioning LCD display on the top.<br/>
<br/>
The image was <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1715673352986403091">shared</a> by device collector and leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>," who has previously shared accurate pre-release information about Apple's FineWoven accessories, various prototypes such as the MagSafe chargers and AirPods in different color options, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier in the day, Kosutami also shared <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1715670862773514358">images of component parts</a> allegedly belonging to a prototype HomePod that features a large touch screen sensor at the top, with a much larger area than the current HomePod panel. <br/>
<br/>
Separately, <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/21/new-homepod-lcd-display/">9to5Mac</a></em> claims to have verified the legitimacy of these images with its own sources, and says that the prototype, codenamed B720, is a new product being actively worked on by Apple, rather than something that the company has experimented with in the past.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>9to5Mac</em>, the LcdUTest app shown on the assembled HomePod's display panel is an internal app used by engineers to test the new display. The outlet says that code in tvOS 17 suggests that Apple Music and Apple Podcasts are the first apps being rewritten to be compatible with the new display, which will show a blurred animation based on the colors of the album art when a song or podcast is playing. The screen could also potentially show important notifications. <br/>
<br/>

<em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman was first to suggest in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/">2021</a> that Apple is working on new HomePods with displays and cameras. Earlier this year, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed Apple plans to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">redesigned HomePod with a 7-inch display</a> in the first half of 2024. <br/>
<br/>
In the long term, Apple is believed to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/08/apple-engineers-pessimistic-apple-tv-strategy/">rethinking its smart home strategy</a>, and is working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-in-development/">combined Apple TV and HomePod device</a>, as well as a HomePod with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/">screen mounted on a robotic arm</a>, according to a Gurman.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/21/images-show-new-homepod-with-screen/">Unreleased HomePod With LCD Display Allegedly Shown in Images</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unreleased-homepod-with-lcd-display-allegedly-shown-in-images.2408299/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After a flurry of rumors suggesting we might see some new iPad models this week, a new Apple Pencil turned out to actually be what was in the cards. The new Apple Pencil charges via USB-C, launches early next month, and is the cheapest model in a lineup that now includes three different Apple Pencils.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/top-stories-21oct2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917959" /><br/>
This week saw some additional rumors about future iPad and iMac models, while we're continuing to hear more about next year's iPhone 16 lineup, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Apple Pencil Announced With Hidden USB-C Port and More</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">announced a new lower-cost Apple Pencil</a> that will be sold alongside the original Apple Pencil and the Apple Pencil 2. It will be available in early November, with U.S. pricing set at &#36;79.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917176" /><br/>
The new Apple Pencil has a similar design as the Apple Pencil 2, but with a USB-C port hidden under a sliding cap for charging and pairing over a USB-C cable. It is compatible with all iPad models equipped with a USB-C port, including the lower-end iPad 10.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/8-things-to-know-about-new-apple-pencil/">8 Things to Know About the New Apple Pencil</a></li></ul><br/>

<br/>
<h2>Apple Possibly Working on Larger iPad Air With 12.9-Inch Display</h2><br/>
A confusing new report from supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em> suggests Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/">may be planning to release a larger iPad Air with a 12.9-inch display</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
A preview of the report earlier this week indicated that a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air would be coming in the next update to the lineup, presumably alongside an updated 10.9-inch model, but the full article is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/2024-ipad-pro-lcd-panel-not-oled-or-mini-led/">less clear about the prospects for a 12.9-inch consumer model</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The report confusingly also claims that the next 12.9-inch iPad Pro will revert to traditional LCD backlighting rather than using the more advanced mini-LED backlighting found on the current model, while also mentioning upcoming iPad Pro models with OLED displays. Stay tuned for additional rumors that will hopefully clear things up.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New 24-Inch iMac Rumored to Launch in 2024</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">plans to release a new 24-inch iMac in 2024</a>, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The current model with the M1 chip was announced in April 2021 and is now quite old.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-M3-Blue-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917291" /><br/>
If Kuo is accurate, there will not be a new iMac this year. The all-in-one desktop computer is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">updated with a faster M3 chip</a> eventually, but no design changes have been rumored for the next model.<br/>
<br/>
Those hoping for a larger iMac may have to wait a bit longer, as Kuo also claims that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">32-inch model with a higher-end mini-LED display</a> won't be coming until 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 Pro Rumor Recap: Larger Displays, Capture Button, 5G Advanced, and More</h2><br/>
While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> are still around 11 months away from launching, there are already several rumors about the devices. We recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/14/iphone-16-pro-rumor-recap-october/">recapped new features and changes expected for the devices</a> so far, so check out the list to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
Key new features rumored for the iPhone 16 Pro models include larger displays, an all-new Capture Button, support for 5G Advanced, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Rumored to Follow ChatGPT With Generative AI Features on iPhone as Soon as iOS 18</h2><br/>
Apple plans to start <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">implementing generative AI technology on the iPhone and iPad in late 2024</a> at the earliest, according to analyst Jeff Pu. This timeframe suggests that generative AI features could be introduced with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity last year when the company OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts, and Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">ramping up its work</a> on similar technology.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Chinese smartphone company OnePlus this week introduced its first foldable smartphone, the OnePlus Open. OnePlus joins several other manufacturers that have come out with foldable smartphones, including Samsung, Google, and Xiaomi. We picked up the OnePlus Open to see how it compares to Apple's latest flagship, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hE172rh7BDo" title="OnePlus Open: Best Foldable in 2023?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The OnePlus Open is similar to the Galaxy Fold in that it opens up like a book. When folded, the cover screen has a 6.31-inch display that's about in the middle of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max in terms of size. Unfolded, the display measures in at 7.82 inches, so a bit smaller than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>. The displays are OLED and support a 120Hz refresh rate, with OnePlus advertising a "Ceramic Guard" cover glass, which sounds almost identical to the Ceramic Shield that Apple uses.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/oneplus-open.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917966" /><br/>
When it comes to form factor, the OnePlus Open is nothing like the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max from Apple since Apple hasn't delved into foldable smartphones as of yet, but there are similar components inside. The OnePlus Open has a premium feel, and size wise, it's between the Z Fold5 and the Pixel Fold. It is able to fold down flat with a crease that's almost unnoticeable, plus it's thin and lightweight.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/oneplus-open-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917967" /><br/>
The Open is 11.7mm thick when it's folded in half, but when you open it up, it's 5.8mm. For comparison, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is 8.25mm thick. As for weight, it is 239 grams, or 18 grams heavier than the 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
OnePlus has a partnership with camera company Hasselblad, and it is using a 48-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 64-megapixel telephoto camera with 6x in-sensor lossless zoom, and a 48-megapixel ultra wide-angle camera. There's also a 20-megapixel front-facing selfie camera accessible when the OnePlus Open is unfolded, and a 32-megapixel selfie camera that can be used when it's closed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/oneplus-open-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917968" /><br/>
Design wise, the lenses are in a large circular housing at the back of the device, which OnePlus likens to a the face of a luxury watch. The lens housing is super massive, and it can be hard to get photos from some of the lenses without your fingers getting in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Other features include the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform, 16GB RAM, a fingerprint sensor power button, a 4,805mAh battery, and support for Wi-Fi 7.<br/>
<br/>

The OnePlus Open is <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/open">available for pre-order</a> as of now, and it is set to launch on October 26. It is priced starting at &#36;1,700.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is unlikely to release any new Macs or iPads for the remainder of 2023, according to a series of predictions shared in recent weeks by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/apple-silicon-mac-lineup-wwdc-2022-feature-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878408" /><br/>
<h2>Macs</h2><br/>
<br/>
Last month, Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">unlikely to release any new MacBooks with the M3 chip</a> this year. All existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models are equipped with M2 series chips, so any new models would presumably be equipped with M3 chips, which effectively means that Kuo does not expect any new MacBooks at all for the rest of 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Kuo added that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">24-inch iMac would be updated next in 2024</a>, ruling out an update to the all-in-one desktop computer this year. All other desktop Macs, including the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, were already updated in 2023 and are highly unlikely to be updated again until 2024 or later.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Macs by Date Last Updated</h3><br/>

<br/>
Last month, Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">unlikely to release any new iPad models</a> before the end of 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to release any new iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad mini, or entry-level iPad models this year. If that trend continues for the remainder of 2023 as expected, it would be the first calendar year with no new iPads released in the device's 13-year history.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded a second release candidate (RC) version of iOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a few days after Apple seeded the first RC. The second release candidate is limited to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, and it won't be available for download on other devices. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912331" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the iOS 17.1 beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta. <br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 adds the option to favorite songs, albums, playlists, artists, and more, with favorited content added to the Library and used for suggestions. Favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen using the Now Playing widget, plus when starting a playlist, you'll now see Song Suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
AirDrop transfers can be finished over the internet so close proximity does not need to be maintained, and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 can now use NameDrop with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running iOS 17.1. On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, iOS 17.1 ensures you won't activate the Camera or Flashlight in your pocket.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include a flashlight indicator in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> for non &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, and a Wallet feature that lets U.S. Discover card users and those in the UK connect their banks to see balances and transactions. Apple's release notes for the update are below:<br/>
<blockquote><strong>AirDrop</strong><br/>
- Content continues to transfer over the internet when you step out of AirDrop range<br/>
<br/>
<strong>StandBy</strong><br/>
- New options to control when the display turns off (iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Music</strong><br/>
- Favorites expanded to include songs, albums, and playlists, and you can filter to display your favorites in the library<br/>
- New cover art collection offers designs that change colors to reflect the music in your playlist<br/>
- Song suggestions appear at the bottom of every playlist, making it easy to add music that matches the vibe of your playlist<br/>
<br/>
<strong>This update also includes the following improvements and bug fixes:</strong><br/>
- Option to choose a specific album to use with Photo Shuffle on the Lock Screen<br/>
- Home key support for Matter locks<br/>
- Improved reliability of Screen Time settings syncing across devices<br/>
- Fixes an issue that may cause the Significant Location privacy setting to reset when transferring an Apple Watch or pairing it for the first time<br/>
- Resolves an issue where the names of incoming callers may not appear when you are on another call<br/>
- Addresses an issue where custom and purchased ringtones may not appear as options for your text tone<br/>
- Fixes an issue that may cause the keyboard to be less responsive<br/>
- Crash detection optimizations (all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models)<br/>
- Fixes an issue that may cause display image persistence<br/>
<br/>
Some features may not be available for all regions or on all Apple devices. For information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222</blockquote>On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, the update also adds support for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">new USB-C Apple Pencil</a>. <br/>

<br/>
Verizon has discounts on both models of the AirPods 3, priced at &#36;149.99 for the Lightning model and &#36;159.00 for the MagSafe model. These discounts are overall second-best prices on the AirPods 3, but we haven't tracked all-time low deals in months, so they're still good deals for anyone looking to purchase the AirPods 3 soon.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://findtuo.com/pages/smart-button">accessory company TUO</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> and a Matter-compatible TUO Smart Button to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/tuo-smart-button-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917945" /><br/>
<a href="https://findtuo.com/pages/smart-button">Priced at &#36;34.95</a>, TUO Smart Button is a simple accessory that is able to activate any of your home automations with the press of a button. TUO is the first Matter-certified Smart Button that supports Thread.<br/>
<br/>
With Matter integration, it can be added to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> setup so long as you have an Apple Matter hub, which includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 2, &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K. Thread allows for better connectivity and interaction with other Thread-enabled products as long as you have a Thread border router. In the &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; ecosystem, the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 2, &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;, and the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K (latest &#36;149 model) have Border router support, as do many other &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/tuo-smart-button-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917946" /><br/>
The Smart Button has a simple, straightforward design and it can be placed anywhere in the home. It comes with a magnetic wall plate and a set of stickers that you can add to denote what the button does. Because it's so compact (about an inch and a half), it is unassuming and blends well with decor.<br/>
<br/>
While there's a single button, it supports a total of three gestures, including a single press, a double press, and a long press. That means three separate actions or automations can be activated with the TUO Smart Button. According to TUO, the button can even be used as an "unofficial" doorbell when it's set up to play a sound on a connected smart speaker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/tuo-smart-button-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917947" /><br/>
Automations in &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; can encompass several actions, like turning off all of the lights in one room at a time, so the TUO Smart Button offers quite a bit of flexibility with the three button options. The entire top part of the TUO can be pressed down, so it is easy to activate your automations even with the small size of the device.<br/>
<br/>
The TUO Smart Button uses a CR2032 battery that is able to last around a year depending on how much the button is used. Aside from Thread, it is also able to connect to a &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; setup using Bluetooth. If you don't have &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj;, or have a home with multiple smart home platforms, the Smart Button also works with other Matter-supported systems.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTuber Luke Miani joins us on this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-future-of-ipad-ft-luke-miani/id1602394741?i=1000632024259">The MacRumors Show</a> to discuss the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> with USB-C, the direction of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup, and Vision Pro. <br/>

We talk through our immediate thoughts on Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">newly announced</a> &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; model featuring a USB-C port for pairing and charging, leading us to contemplate how to clean up the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup as a whole. We compare Apple's Vision Pro headset to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and consider whether it is destined for similar criticisms or if it truly offers more potential in the long-term. We also discuss the latest rumors about a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">foldable iPad</a>, which a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/foldable-ipad-now-in-intensive-development-could-be-announced-as-soon-as-late-2024/">recent report</a> suggested could be announced as soon as next year, and whether such a device could breathe new life into the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">announced a new lower-cost Apple Pencil</a> compatible with all iPad models equipped with a USB-C port. It launches in early November and will be sold alongside the original Apple Pencil and the second-generation Apple Pencil.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/8-New-Apple-Pencil-Features.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917933" /><br/>
<h2>Key Facts About the New Apple Pencil</h2><br/>
<ol><li>It has a similar design as the Apple Pencil 2, but with a USB-C port hidden under a sliding cap for charging and pairing over a USB-C cable.</li><br/>
<li>It is compatible with all iPad models equipped with a USB-C port.</li><br/>
<li>It attaches magnetically to compatible iPads, including the tenth-generation iPad, but it does not support wireless charging or wireless pairing.</li><br/>
<li>Unlike the Apple Pencil 2, the new model lacks pressure sensitivity on an iPad screen, a double-tap gesture for switching between drawing tools, and the option for personal engraving at the time of purchase.</li><br/>
<li>It supports the Apple Pencil hover feature when used with the latest iPad Pro models, released in October 2022.</li><br/>
<li>It weighs roughly the same as the Apple Pencil 2, but it is around 7% shorter.</li><br/>
<li>In the U.S., it costs &#36;79 for the general public and &#36;69 for students. This is cheaper than the first two generations of the Apple Pencil, which remain available for &#36;99 and &#36;129, respectively.</li><br/>
<li>It launches in early November. Apple has not provided a specific release date.</li></ol><h2>Apple Pencil Comparison Chart</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> show "The Problem With Jon Stewart" has been canceled because of "creative differences" between Stewart and Apple executives, reports <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/business/media/jon-stewart-the-problem-ends.html">The New York Times</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>

Members of the show's staff were informed about its end on Thursday, according to several people with knowledge of the situation, just a couple of weeks before episodes for the third season were scheduled to begin. <br/>
<br/>
The editorial disagreements reportedly revolved around some of the planned guests on "The Problem," as well as potential show topics related to China and artificial intelligence that were causing concern among Apple executives. Apple did not respond to <em>NYT</em>'s request for comment.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in 2020 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/27/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-series/">secured</a> a multi-year deal with the writer, producer, and former host of "The Daily Show", which saw Stewart return to television following his 2015 retirement. <br/>
<br/>
The name of the show, "The Problem with Jon Stewart," is a nod to the issues that Stewart explored on the current affairs new series, with topics in the 20 episodes ranging from what's in the national conversation to issues that are part of Stewart's advocacy work.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nytimes-com/">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/apple-tv-show-problem-jon-steward-canceled/">Apple TV+ Show &#039;The Problem With Jon Stewart&#039; Reportedly Canceled</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-show-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-reportedly-canceled.2408168/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro will revert to an LCD display instead of adopting OLED panel technology, claims a controversial new report coming out of Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ipad-pro-red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906242" /><br/>
It has been widely reported that Apple's next iPad Pro models will be the first Apple tablets to debut superior OLED panels, with rumors suggesting they will begin shipping <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/ipad-pro-oled-display-mass-production-early-2024/">around the middle of next year</a>. That's not necessarily the case, according to a confusing new <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231019PD217/apple-led-display-panel-mobile-devices-pc-ce.html">DigiTimes</a></em> report. <br/>
<br/>
The Taiwan-based outlet now claims Apple will in fact revert to using LCD backlighting for its upcoming 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, putting it on par with the existing 11-inch model. <br/>
<br/>
The current 12.9-inch iPad Pro features a mini-LED display that Apple calls a "Liquid Retina XDR display," while the 11-inch variant uses an inferior LCD-based "Liquid Retina Display."  <br/>
<br/>
The report alleges that the high production cost of using mini-LED backlights in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro has been a "hurdle for broader industry adoption," and that Apple's pivot back to conventional backlight technology "could be motivated by the company's focus on scalability and market penetration." <br/>
<br/>
As a result of the component changes, production of the new 12.9-inch iPads could be postponed to "early 2024 at the latest," having originally been slated to start in "early November," adds <em>DigiTimes</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Several things don't add up in this latest report. As covered previously by <em>MacRumors</em>, ‌<em>DigiTimes</em> on Thursday alluded to the same report in its "Before Going to Press" section by claiming that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/">forthcoming 12.9-inch iPad Air may feature LCD backlighting</a> as opposed to the mini-LED backlighting used in the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro.<br/>
<br/>
However, the fully published report no longer mentions this alleged larger "12.9-inch iPad Air," and simply makes a passing reference to "a new iPad Air" that will also use traditional LCD backlighting like the next iPad Pro.<br/>
<br/>
To add to the confusion, the full article appears to contradict itself by repeating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/23/apple-oled-ipad-panels-samsung-lg-2024/">widely reported</a> claims that "Apple might launch a new iPad Pro with AMOLED displays earliest in 2024, sourcing mainly from Samsung Display and LG Display." Whether the OLED model is meant to be in addition to the alleged 12.9-inch iPad Pro with LCD display previously mentioned is simply not specified. <br/>
<br/>
Leaving aside the inconsistencies in the above claims, if the next 12.9-inch iPad Pro reverted from mini-LED to traditional LCD panel technology, it would be considered a major regression for Apple's most premium tablet offering, especially given that OLED display technology is perhaps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/2024-ipad-pro-what-to-expect/">the most anticipated upgrade</a> coming to the next-generation ‌iPad Pro‌ models. <br/>
<br/>
Given the contradictions in <em>DigiTimes</em>' reporting, not to mention its history for misinterpreting supply chain information, this claim alone should be taken with a large grain of salt until other sources can corroborate it. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/2024-ipad-pro-lcd-panel-not-oled-or-mini-led/">2024 iPad Pro to Use LCD Panel Instead of OLED or Mini-LED, Claims Sketchy Report</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2024-ipad-pro-to-use-lcd-panel-instead-of-oled-or-mini-led-claims-sketchy-report.2408159/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the explosive popularity of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, there have been rumors that Apple is working on its own AI product, and that some kind of "Apple GPT" artificial intelligence bot could launch in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840591" /><br/>
This guide highlights everything we know about Apple's experiments with AI, and it will be updated regularly as new rumors come out.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="internal_testing_and_development">Internal Testing and Development</h2><br/>
Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea is leading development on large language models within Apple, and Giannandrea reports directly to Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>. Giannandrea <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">established a team</a> that works on conversational AI four years ago, and work has since ramped up.<br/>
<br/>
For the last several months, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-experimenting-with-chatgpt-tool/">has been testing</a> an "Apple GPT" rival that could compete with ChatGPT. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, work on AI is a priority for Apple, with the company designing an "Ajax" framework for large language models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has an internal chatbot that some engineers have been referring to as "Apple GPT," but Apple would not, of course, ever use that naming for a consumer product. Apple employees need special permission to use the chatbot, and its output cannot be used to develop new product features for customers. It is used for product prototyping and it is able to answer questions about the data that was used to train it.<br/>
<br/>
Ajax is said to be more capable than the prior-generation ChatGPT 3.5, and it has been trained on more than 200 billion parameters. As of September 2023, OpenAI's newer models are allegedly more powerful than Ajax.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reportedly does not have a "clear strategy" for how it will create a generative AI product for consumers. Apple is experimenting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> enhancements, software that generates videos and images, and multimodal AI technology that works with images, videos, and text.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be spending <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">millions of dollars a day</a> on conversational AI research as training language models requires a lot of hardware.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ai_for_siri">AI for Siri</h2><br/>
Apple's work on generative AI could eventually be incorporated into its &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; voice assistant. Apple in February 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/15/apple-engineers-working-on-chatgpt-like-ai/">held an AI summit</a> and briefed employees on its large language model work.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the way &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is built, it may take Apple quite a bit of time to update its database to support new capabilities. Former &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; engineer John Burkey told <em>The New York Times</em> that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s "cumbersome design" means that adding new phrases requires rebuilding the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; database, which can take up to six weeks each time, while more complicated features like search tools can take upwards of a year.<br/>
<br/>
There are also privacy concerns that Apple needs to contend with to bring generative AI capabilities to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. Apple has always been more cautious than its competitors, putting privacy ahead of functionality, a decision that has caused &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to lag behind Alexa, Google Assistant, and other voice-based personal assistant options.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em> suggests that Apple is aiming to create a feature that would let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; automate multi-step tasks, automatically performing tasks that are accomplished with Shortcuts today.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="third-party_ai_bans_at_apple">Third-Party AI Bans at Apple</h2><br/>
Apple employees <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/apple-bans-employees-from-using-chatgpt/">have been banned</a> from using ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and other artificial intelligence tools. Apple is concerned that AI tools could leak confidential company data.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. government, healthcare institutions, and banks have also prevented employees from using ChatGPT because of similar fears. Tech companies like Verizon, Google, Samsung, and others have banned generative AI tools too.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ai_competition">AI Competition</h2><br/>
Almost every major tech company has some kind of AI product in the works. In addition to OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all adopted generative AI for various purposes.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong><a href="https://bard.google.com">Google</a></strong> - Google has developed Bard, a chat-based AI tool. Google has also integrated generative AI into its search products and apps, plus Bard can integrate with Google Flights, Maps, Drive, and more.</li><br/>
 <li><strong><a href="https://www.bing.com/?/ai">Microsoft</a></strong> - Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI for a version of ChatGPT that is integrated with its Bing search engine.</li><br/>
 <li><strong><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-alexa-generative-ai">Amazon</a></strong> - Amazon is working to enhance its Alexa voice assistant with generative AI.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Meta</strong> - Meta is incorporating generative AI into several of its apps. WhatsApp and Messenger, for example, can use generative AI to make custom stickers, while there's a Meta AI beta available for WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="apples_current_use_of_ai_and_machine_learning">Apple's Current Use of AI and Machine Learning</h2><br/>
Apple is already using artificial intelligence and machine learning for a long list of functions in its products. AI is used for almost everything, with a small sampling below.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Photos</strong> - Apple uses machine learning to enhance photos that are taken with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s camera. This includes everything from Deep Fusion for cutting down on noise in images to the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Portrait Mode tools that let you enable portrait images after a photo has been taken.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Spotlight Search</strong> - Spotlight search and search throughout the iOS operating system is powered by AI.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Visual Lookup</strong> - The feature that lets the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; detect the content in photos is a machine learning feature.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Crash Detection and Fall Detection</strong> - Fall Detection and Crash Detection both use machine learning to determine whether someone has been in a crash or had a fall based on the information collected by the various sensors in Apple devices.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>ECG</strong> - The ECG feature on the Apple Watch looks at heart rhythm data to determine whether someone is likely to be experiencing atrial fibrillation.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Autocorrect</strong> - Apple's autocorrect system and word suggestion options are powered by machine learning.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Siri Suggestions</strong> - When your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; suggests something, such as sending someone a birthday message or adding an event in your Mail app to the Calendar, it's using machine learning algorithms.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Apple's devices have dedicated Neural Engines inside specifically for powering machine learning capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="tim_cook_on_ai">Tim Cook on AI</h2><br/>
Back in May 2023, Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that the potential of artificial intelligence is "very interesting," but he said there are a "number of issues that need to be sorted" with the technology. He explained that it is "very important to be deliberate and thoughtful" when deciding how and when AI should be used.<br/>
<br/>
Cook <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/03/apple-q3-2023-earnings-call-takeaways/">has also said</a> that AI and machine learning are "core fundamental technologies integral to virtually every product" that Apple has created, and that AI work is "absolutely critical" to the company. Cook has confirmed that Apple has been experimenting with generative AI "for years."<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="potential_launch_date">Potential Launch Date</h2><br/>
Both <em>The Information</em> and analyst Jeff Pu claim that Apple will have some kind of generative AI feature available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">around late 2024</a>, which is when iOS 18 will be coming out.<br/>
<br/>
Pu said in October that Apple is building a few hundred AI servers in 2023, with more to come in 2024. Apple will reportedly offer a combination of cloud-based AI and AI with on-device processing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/no-sign-of-apple-generative-ai-coming-2024/">said in August</a> that there is "no sign" of generative AI technology coming in 2024, and he claimed that Apple's work on generative AI is "significantly behind its competitors."<br/>
