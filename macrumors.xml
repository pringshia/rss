		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store guidelines</a> to comply with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">anti-steering mandate</a> levied by the European Commission. Music streaming apps like Spotify are now permitted to include a link or buy button that leads to a website with information about alternative music purchasing options, though this is only permitted <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/music-streaming-services-entitlement-eea/">in the European Economic Area</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><blockquote>Music Streaming Services Entitlements: music streaming apps in specific regions can use Music Streaming Services Entitlements to include a link (which may take the form of a buy button) to the developer's website that informs users of other ways to purchase digital music content or services. These entitlements also permit music streaming app developers to invite users to provide their email address for the express purpose of sending them a link to the developer's website to purchase digital music content or services. Learn more about these entitlements.<br/>
<br/>
In accordance with the entitlement agreements, the link may inform users about where and how to purchase those in-app purchase items, and the price of such items. The entitlements are limited to use only in the iOS or iPadOS App Store in specific storefronts. In all other storefronts, streaming music apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.</blockquote>The European Commission in March fined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">Apple &#36;2 billion</a> for anti-competitive conduct against rival music streaming services. The fine also came with a requirement that Apple "remove the anti-steering provisions" from its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules, which Apple has now done. Apple is restricted from repeating the infringement or adopting similar practices in the future, though it is worth noting that Apple plans to appeal the decision.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has accused Spotify of manipulating the European Commission to get the rules of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rewritten in its favor. "They want to use Apple's tools and technologies, distribute on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and benefit from the trust we've built with users - and pay Apple nothing for it," <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">Apple complained</a> following the ruling.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to updating its streaming music rules, Apple today also added games from retro game console emulator apps to the list of permitted software allowable under guideline 4.7. Guideline 4.7 permits apps to offer HTML5 mini apps and mini games, streaming games, chatbots, game emulators, and plug-ins.<blockquote>Apps may offer certain software that is not embedded in the binary, specifically HTML5 mini apps and mini games, streaming games, chatbots, and plug-ins. Additionally, retro game console emulator apps can offer to download games. You are responsible for all such software offered in your app, including ensuring that such software complies with these Guidelines and all applicable laws.</blockquote><br/>
Game emulators have managed to sneak onto the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; several times over the years by using hidden functionality, but Apple has not explicitly permitted them until now. The rule change that allows for game emulators is worldwide, as is support for apps that offer mini apps and mini games.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-review-guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">Apple Updates App Store Guidelines to Permit Game Emulators, Website Links in EU Music Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-updates-app-store-guidelines-to-permit-game-emulators-website-links-in-eu-music-apps.2423618/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Is a Screen Useful on AirPods? Check Out This Knockoff With a Display</title>

		<description><![CDATA[If you've ever wondered what it might be like to use AirPods with a display, well, a Chinese manufacturer made a fake version of the AirPods complete with a screen that we decided to test out. Would a touchscreen actually be worthwhile on AirPods?<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nuVsM08kZUs" title="Apple AirPods Ultra: AirPods With a Screen?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The display on the fake AirPods activates when the case is opened up. It shows connectivity status, the time, the battery level of each earbud, noise control options, "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>" settings, and equalizer presets. Other additions include customizable wallpaper, a flashlight, and a feature for controlling the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s camera.<br/>
<br/>
You're basically only able to control settings with the display, which is mildly useful. Actual AirPods need to be controlled through an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac, with some options available through the Control Center/Status Bar and others buried in the settings app.<br/>
<br/>
The touchscreen on the fake AirPods is, to put it politely, garbage. It doesn't register touches some of the time, the sound is mediocre, there are non-functional buttons, and the equalizer settings just make everything sound worse.<br/>
<br/>
So why did we buy these earbuds? Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/apple-airpods-case-with-touchscreen/">patented a similar concept back in 2021</a>, describing a set of AirPods with a built-in touchscreen display that can be used to manage settings and also control playback. In Apple's patent description, there are options for adjusting volume, favoriting songs, playing and pausing, skipping songs, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple suggested that the touchscreen could offer tactile feedback and provide a more convenient way to control wireless earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
We don't recommend counterfeit products, of course, so you should not go out and buy these. The fake AirPods do give us some idea of the utility of a touchscreen and how it could be used, which is interesting to imagine. Would you want an AirPods case with a touchscreen? Let us know in the comments below.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/fake-airpods-with-display/">Is a Screen Useful on AirPods?

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCK4q6E0kmI?si=MyjQW43-SiwhnNAD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div> <br/>
Apple is reportedly looking into personal robotics, such as a "mobile robot" that would "follow users around their homes" and an "advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around." In the long term, Apple apparently wants to create machines that can "handle chores, like cleaning dishes in a sink," but the robotics projects are said to be in the very early stages of research, and it is unclear if any of them will ever be released.<br/>
<br/>
We also talk through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/new-beats-solo-4-to-feature-improved-sound-usb-c/">Beats Solo 4 headphones</a> and Apple's upcoming iOS 17.5 update, which introduces web distribution in the EU, a color-changing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> widget, hints about next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> battery monitoring features and an upcoming &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; model, and third-party item tracker alerts. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> is now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips going forward:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's CEO Tim Cook this week sold 196,410 shares of the company's stock, which had a total value of approximately &#36;33.2 million based on the average sale price of the transactions, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/b5c77d48-ad7d-4b61-bc72-2949d86b4d43.pdf">filing</a>. After taxes, Cook netted <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/accdf66b-4a6e-4bb1-b259-95a5f9a767cf.pdf">nearly &#36;16.4 million</a> from the sales.<br/>
<br/>

Cook received all of the shares that he sold this week as a performance-based stock award. Like other senior executives at Apple, he has a predetermined trading plan to sell company stocks in accordance with insider trading laws.<br/>
<br/>
Cook still owns nearly 3.3 million shares of Apple's stock following the sales, according to the filing. He has served as Apple's CEO since 2011.<br/>
<br/>

		<title>Notice: Apple ID Balances in Singapore Cannot Be Spent Starting July 1</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting on July 1, 2024, it will no longer be possible to spend an Apple ID balance in Singapore, according to an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118602">Apple support document</a> spotted by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a>. Apple did not provide an explanation for this decision, but it appears to relate to new regulations introduced by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. In general, gift cards are frequently involved in scams that defraud people.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/Apple-Giftcard-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1778" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-819100" /><br/>
Apple says that any App Store & iTunes gift cards added to an Apple ID balance before July 1 can still be used toward digital purchases until that deadline.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will issue refunds to customers with a remaining Apple ID balance after the deadline:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>After spending your balance is no longer possible, Apple will begin to automatically issue refunds for any remaining Apple ID balance to users in Singapore. If you have a balance, your money will be refunded to the default credit or debit card on file as a payment method for your Apple ID. You'll receive a confirmation email when Apple has processed your refund. Afterwards, it might take up to 30 days for your financial institution to show the refund in your account.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Apple already stopped selling gift cards in Singapore last year, and discontinuing Apple ID balances appears to be a related decision.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Store gift cards are unaffected by this change, and they can continue to be used at the three Apple Store locations in Singapore.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Yesterday, two unreleased Apple devices were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/new-ipad-models-spotted-in-regulatory-database/">discovered in Indian regulatory filings</a>. A further two models have now been spotted ahead of the expected announcement of new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models next month. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPad-Air-5.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938463" /><br/>
The second wave of listings, spotted by <a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/new-ipad-a2898-a2899-bis-certification/"><em>MySmartPrice</em></a>, appears in the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) database with the model numbers A2898 and A2899. This joins the two models seen yesterday with the model numbers A2836 and A2837. All four model numbers do not correlate with any existing Apple devices, but four new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models are expected to launch next month: A 10.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, a 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, an 11.1-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and a 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
It is not clear whether A2898 and A2899 are new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, but both product lines are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">expected to be refreshed in May</a> following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-suppliers-say-new-ipads-repeatedly-postponed/">repeated delays</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week filed a required notice with the state of California, confirming plans to permanently lay off more than 600 employees. Under California law, employers must give employees and state representatives a 60-day notice before a mass layoff event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774150" /><br/>
The employees listed are located in several Apple-occupied buildings around Santa Clara, California, which is close to Apple's Cupertino headquarters. Several of these locations were rumored to be associated with Apple Car development in the past, so it is likely that these layoffs are related to Apple's decision to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">stop work on the car project</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple officially ended development on the Apple Car in March. Approximately 2,000 employees working on the Apple Car were told that the project was winding down at that time, and Apple began the process of moving some of them to work on artificial intelligence under John Giannandrea and in other relevant departments.<br/>
<br/>
Other employees were given 90 days to apply for open positions within the company, but Apple hired hardware engineers and car designers while working on the Apple Car, and these employees may not have had skills applicable to other projects.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-ends-microled-apple-watch-development/">recently ended development</a> on in-house microLED displays, so some of the layoffs might also be related to the decision to discontinue that work.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-employee-layoffs-car-project/">Apple Lays Off 600+ Employees After Canceling Car Project</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-lays-off-600-employees-after-canceling-car-project.2423567/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> gaming service to add a selection of new games to play. The main new addition is Puyo Puyo Puzzle Pop, a game in Sega's popular Puyo Puyo series.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/puyo-puyo-apple-arcade.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944936" /><br/>
In <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/puyo-puyo-puzzle-pop/id6446146451">Puyo Puyo Puzzle Pop</a>, players match up Puyos of the same color to clear the board and cause damage to opponents. As with Tetris, Puyo pieces fall from the top of the screen and can be rotated and moved to make matches.<br/>
<br/>
The game has a storyline to uncover by progressing through the levels, and there are 24 playable characters to unlock, with many from prior Puyo Puyo games. Different rule sets can be used, including options from Puyo Puyo 2 and Puyo Puyo Fever, and there is also an endless mode.<br/>
<br/>
There is a single player mode to play, but there are also multiplayer battles. Up to four players can join through Game Center.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-monsters-ate-my-condo/id6446234652">Super Monsters Ate My Condo</a>, also new today, is a classic iOS game that's making a reappearance on &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;. The idea is swipe to feed condos to monsters, while also making color matches for high scoring combos.<br/>
<br/>
The third game available on &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sago-mini-trips/id6473044987">Sago Mini Trips+</a>, which is designed for children.<br/>
<br/>

On the call, which will be <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">streamed live on Apple's investor website</a>, Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the company's earnings results for the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year. During the quarter, which ran from December 31, 2023 through March 30, 2024, Apple launched the Vision Pro headset in the U.S., and it updated the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with its latest M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not provided formal guidance since early 2020, but analysts expect the company to report quarterly revenue of &#36;90.6 billion on average, according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis?p=AAPL">Yahoo Finance</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/04/apple-2q-2023-earnings/">reported &#36;94.8 billion revenue</a> in the year-ago quarter.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On Monday, June 10, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/wwdc-2024-apple-park-special-event/">plans to hold a keynote viewing party</a> for select students and developers, allowing them to watch the pre-recorded unveiling of new software updates. Apple accepted applications for the event until yesterday, and now emails are going out to developers who have been selected by the lottery process.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943518" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-park-special-event-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" /><br/>
The event will include "exciting new programming," an opportunity to meet with Apple experts, and other WWDC-related "special activities."<br/>
<br/>
At <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/wwdc-2023-apple-park-viewing-event-details/">last year's WWDC event</a>, developers and students were provided with refreshments in the morning, followed by the keynote event. The Platforms State of the Union followed, and there were two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> tours to choose from. The day ended with the Apple Design Awards and an evening dinner.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Boom! I got a golden ticket for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC24?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWDC24</a> special event at Apple Park! &#x1f929; Check your inboxes, folks – see you there? &#x1f4ab; <a href="https://t.co/A3F0JLe9rq">pic.twitter.com/A3F0JLe9rq</a></p>&mdash; Paul Hudson (@twostraws) <a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1775985439930765779?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Prior to 2020, the Worldwide Developers Conference was an in-person event that was hosted in San Jose, California. Developers were required to pay &#36;1,599 to purchase a ticket to attend, and space was limited. Starting in 2020, Apple turned WWDC into an online event open to all developers, but there have been small in-person events at &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; since 2022.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a reception event at Apple's Infinite Loop campus on Sunday, June 9, where attendees can pick up their badges early.<br/>
<br/>
Apple extended invitations to Current Apple Developer Program members, Apple Developer Enterprise Program members, Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni, and Swift Student Challenge winners from 2022 to 2024. Attendees were chosen by random selection.<br/>
<br/>
While there is no cost to attend the &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; special event, Apple does not cover transportation or lodging. Out-of-state attendees will need to purchase airfare, hotel accommodations, and transportation to &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj;.  <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> is set to take place from June 10 to June 14. Developers not selected to attend the special event can watch the keynote, interface with Apple engineers, and watch WWDC sessions online.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-park-2024-special-event-emails/">Apple Sending Emails to Developers Invited to WWDC 2024 Apple Park Special Event</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sending-emails-to-developers-invited-to-wwdc-2024-apple-park-special-event.2423552/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular accessory company <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1554062&u=63177&m=98197&urllink=&afftrack=">Satechi</a> offers a wide variety of docks and hubs compatible with Apple's Mac lineup, and I've recently spent some time testing out the company's &#36;150 <a href="https://shrsl.com/4hat7">USB-C Dual Dock Stand</a> that adds a significant amount of connectivity to your Mac while remaining tucked out of sight and even giving your laptop a bit of extra breathing room.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-dock-stand-front.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944922" /><br/>
Perhaps the most noteworthy design aspect of the USB-C Dual Dock Stand is right in the name, and that's the fact that it serves as a stand to elevate your Mac laptop on a desk, allowing for extra airflow to help keep things cool and giving a couple extra inches of height to the display to bring it a little closer to eye level and perhaps make for a bit more comfortable typing position if you're using your MacBook's keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
The dock measures right around 12 inches (30 cm) wide, and its wedge-shaped form factor sits nicely under the rear portion of a Mac laptop. Rubber feet on the dock help with stability, and there's a raised rubber ridge on the top surface of the dock for your Mac to sit on without scratching either the Mac or the dock. Openings on the front and back bottom edges of the dock provide some ventilation for the dock itself, but I didn't notice anything getting significantly warm.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-dock-stand-macbook-side.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="871" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944927" /><br/>
The dock is largely constructed of space gray aluminum with a black top, and there's some clean Satechi branding in white on the top, though all of this will be essentially invisible if you've got your Mac sitting on top of it. A 7.5-inch integrated dual cable sticks out one end of the dock, terminating in USB-C connectors for hooking the dock up to your computer. There's a space gray collar around the two connectors that spaces them perfectly to connect to adjacent USB-C ports on recent Macs with a single motion, or if you've got a compatible machine with different port spacing, the collar can slide back to give you more wiggle room with the individual connectors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-dock-stand-connectors.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="939" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944928" /><br/>
Most of the dock's other features are along the rear side, allowing you to route cables out of sight off the back of your desk. In addition to a color-coded sliding power switch and a white LED that confirms whether the dock has power, the USB-C Dual Dock Stand includes nine ports along the back side. There are two USB-C ports (one supporting up to 10 Gbps and one up to 5 Gbps), two USB-A ports (similarly with one at up to 10 Gbps and one at up to 5 Gbps), and a Gigabit Ethernet port if you need a wired data connection. For display compatibility, there are two HDMI 2.0 ports each supporting up to a 4K display at 60Hz, plus a DisplayPort 1.4 port also supporting up to 4K60Hz.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-dock-stand-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="460" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944923" /><br/>
Depending on your Mac, the USB-C Dual Dock Stand can support up to two external displays, with either both connected via HDMI or one via HDMI and one via DisplayPort. The USB-C ports on the dock do not support video, so you can't connect external displays via that method. If you're running an Apple silicon Mac, you'll need one of the higher-level Pro or Max chips to support dual external displays in addition to the built-in display on your laptop. If your machine has a base M3 chip, you can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-two-displays-lid-closed/">run two external displays with the laptop lid closed</a>, while machines with the base <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip are limited to one external display.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to Apple silicon Macs, select Intel-based MacBook Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models are also supported, as are a handful of Windows machines such as the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 and Surface Laptop Studio, Lenovo Yoga 6 and 7i, Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra, and Dell XPS 15.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-dock-stand-macbook-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944926" /><br/>
There's one final port on the rear of the dock, and that's a USB-C port for accepting incoming power. The dock can be bus-powered from the connected Mac, but performance under heavy load will be hampered. Using an external power adapter, which isn't provided in the box but should be readily available to most users, the dock can draw up to around 15 watts while providing up to 75 watts of passthrough power to the connected Mac, ensuring you only need one connection to your Mac for everything. I used the 140-watt Apple power adapter that came with my MacBook Pro, and it provided all the power the dock needed while I also saw 69 watts of power going to my Mac, which was plenty to refuel it quickly and keep it charged up during use.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-dock-stand-ssd-bay.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="743" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944924" /><br/>
Beyond all of the rear ports. the USB-C Dual Dock Stand has one more trick up its sleeve, and that's a built-in SSD bay, letting you add some external storage (sold separately) to your Mac for backups or extra storage space without taking up any additional physical space. The enclosure accepts M.2 SATA and NVMe SSDs at up to 6 Gbps for SATA drives and 10 Gbps for NVMe drives. SSD sizes of 2242, 2260, and 2280 are all supported, and I used a fast 2 TB WD_BLACK NVMe drive in a 2280 size for my testing.<br/>
<br/>
Installation was fairly simple, requiring easy removal of a cover on the bottom of the dock to access the drive bay and installation of an adhesive thermal pad to prepare for adding the SSD. From there, it was just a matter of sliding the SSD into the socket in the bay, pressing it flat, and securing it with the provided screw and screwdriver. Getting the tiny screw in the proper position down in the drive bay was a little bit of a finicky process, but it only took a couple of minutes to get everything assembled.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-dock-stand-ssd.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="671" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944925" /><br/>
With the SSD installed in the dock, the drive mounts when the dock is connected to the Mac giving you easy to access to however much additional storage you've added. My testing showed write speeds of 975 MB/s and read speeds of 880 MB/s, and while there are certainly external enclosures out there that can support faster speeds with this drive, the performance was quite solid. <br/>
<br/>
USB ports proved to be a bit more of a mixed bag. The ports on this dock are intended to be primarily for data use, so they don't provide significant charging capabilities. They offer enough power to support most low-demand accessories like a thumb drive or even my Stream Deck, but they struggle more with higher-power devices like bus-powered external SSDs. One of my test enclosures worked fine when connected to the 5 Gbps USB-C port on the dock, but my Mac threw up an error about drawing too much power when I connected the enclosure to the 10 Gbps USB-C port. So just be aware that while this dock provides some nice flexibility for USB connectivity, you won't be able to connect high-powered peripherals like Apple's SuperDrive or quickly recharge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Display connectivity is as you would expect, and I had no issues driving a pair of 4K external displays in either the dual HDMI or the HDMI/DisplayPort configuration. Displays hooked up via the dock looked good and I experienced no connectivity glitches. It's worth emphasizing that with no support for USB-C/Thunderbolt displays and a maximum of 4K supported over HDMI and Thunderbolt, you won't be able to use higher-resolution displays like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a> with this dock. But the popularity of 4K options means many users will already be using displays that do work.<br/>
<br/>
I did notice that physically plugging and unplugging some of the beefier connectors like HDMI and DisplayPort from the dock could be a bit tricky as the dock tucked under my MacBook Pro tended to slide around a bit, but I got the hang of stabilizing the dock on its two ends while manipulating the connectors. Fortunately, one of the main points of a dock is to allow all of your peripherals to remain connected, so you shouldn't need to be plugging and unplugging both things very frequently.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, Satechi's USB-C Dual Dock Stand offers a nice set of features for those looking to beef up their MacBook desk setup. It offers enough ports to provide some extra connectivity, plus the onboard SSD bay is a nice inclusion. The dock's form factor means it can be tucked cleanly out of the way while also offering some minor ergonomic benefits. And while it's around a foot long, the fact that it can include an onboard SSD and runs off of either bus power or the USB-C power adapter you probably have in your bag already, it's fairly portable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/satechi-dock-stand-box.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1020" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944929" /><br/>
The dock is missing a few features like support for USB-C display connections and an SD card reader, but if its feature set meets your needs, it's worthy of consideration. While you can find some USB-C hubs with dual 4K display support for less, &#36;150 really isn't a bad price considering the extra features this dock brings. Just remember you'll need to spend a bit more for the SSD to go inside it if you want to take advantage of that feature.<br/>
<br/>
The USB-C Dual Dock Stand is available <a href="https://shrsl.com/4hat7">directly from Satechi</a> for &#36;149.99, but <a href="https://bhpho.to/3vBo993">B&H Photo has it for &#36;129.99</a> at the time of this review.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today began letting Android customers know that it will soon launch a promised Android-based <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> Device network, reports <em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/04/google-android-find-my-device-network-launch-date/">9to5Google</a></em>. Google announced the upcoming &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; feature last year, but it has not yet debuted because Apple and Google were working to develop <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/apple-to-expand-unwanted-tracking-alerts/">a cross-platform solution</a> for unwanted tracking alerts.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894205" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/AirTag-and-iPhone-Notification-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1082" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-third-party-item-tracker-alerts/">Code in iOS 17.5 suggests</a> that Apple is adding support for discovering nearby third-party item trackers and alerting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners when one has been located. "You can disable this item and stop it from sharing its location with the owner. To do this, follow the instructions provided on a website by the manufacturer of this item," reads some of the code.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple likely planning to add alerts for third-party trackers in iOS 17.5, Google is clear to launch its new &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Device network, which will allow Android smartphones to be used to locate lost phones, Bluetooth trackers, headphones, and other accessories.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and Google first announced plans for an industry tracker specification in May 2023, with the aim of putting an end to the misuse of Bluetooth item trackers for tracking individuals. Both companies have been working to implement AirTag-style tracking alerts so people will know when a tracker of any kind is nearby.<br/>
<br/>
After Apple launched the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network alongside AirTags, there were countless news stories and reports of criminals using AirTags for stalking purposes, leading Apple to make several changes to unwanted tracker alerts. iPhones were initially able to identify nearby AirTags and alert customers if they were being used for stalking purposes, but Android devices could not. Apple remedied this with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/android-tracker-detect-app/">Tracker Detect app for Android</a>, but the partnership with Google will allow for a more permanent and reliable solution that will work regardless of device.<br/>
<br/>
Google says that the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Device network will let Android users find their devices even when offline, and it will work with compatible Fast Pair accessories as well as Android-based electronics. Google plans to launch the network early next week.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/google-android-find-my-device-network/">Google to Launch Android Find My Network After Apple Adds Third-Party Tracker Alerts to iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-to-launch-android-find-my-network-after-apple-adds-third-party-tracker-alerts-to-iphone.2423543/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The public beta comes a day after Apple released the developer beta. <br/>

Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There were no new features found in the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.5 developer beta, and Apple listed no additions in its release notes. It is likely that the update focuses on bug fixes and other small under-the-hood improvements. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-seeds-first-public-beta-of-macos-14-5/">Apple Seeds First Public Beta of macOS 14.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-public-beta-of-macos-14-5.2423540/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its release. The public iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 betas come two days after Apple released the betas for developers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943813" /><br/>
Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5 is limited on new outward-facing features, focusing primarily on changes in the European Union. App developers in the EU are now able to add their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> apps to their website, so that users can download them directly without having to use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
To offer an app for download from a website in the European Union, developers need to meet specific criteria. Developers need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and must have an app with more than one million first installs on iOS in the European Union in the prior year. Other requirements include submitting to Apple's notarization process and publishing transparent data collection policies.<br/>
<br/>
This feature is limited to the European Union due to the Digital Markets Act and is not available to all users.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-releases-ios-17-5-public-beta-1/">Apple Releases First Public Beta of iOS 17.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-first-public-beta-of-ios-17-5.2423538/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple chip supplier TSMC has reportedly resumed most of its operations after a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan's eastern coast on Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-silicon-1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1422" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924673" /><br/>
TSMC <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-04/taiwan-begins-recovery-from-quake-as-tsmc-resumes-production">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> that more than 80% of its chip production lines are operational again as of Thursday, and it said there has been no damage to its most critical equipment. More specifically, Taiwanese research firm <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240404-12108.html">TrendForce said</a> that TSMC's 3nm, 4nm, and 5nm chip factories resumed more than 90% of their operations within hours after the earthquake, suggesting that Apple chip production has not been significantly impacted.<br/>
<br/>
While this update from TSMC has been widely reported, Apple chip production is obviously the least of concerns following the earthquake, which has reportedly caused at least 10 deaths and over 1,000 injuries in Taiwan.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/tsmc-resumes-most-operations/">TSMC Resumes Majority of Apple Chip Production Following Earthquake</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tsmc-resumes-majority-of-apple-chip-production-following-earthquake.2423532/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been nearly 18 months since Apple last updated its iPad lineup, and customers are anxiously waiting for new models to be announced. For months, there have been rumors about new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, but the estimated timeframe for their release has been repeatedly pushed back from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">March</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/">April</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">May</a>.<br/>
<br/>

In defense of these rumors, it does sound like Apple has experienced delays with the new iPads. <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240402PD218.html"><em>DigiTimes</em> this week</a> cited sources at Taiwanese suppliers who said mass production of camera lenses for the upcoming iPads has been "repeatedly postponed," and the report vaguely mentions that a "production launch" will likely take place in May.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last week reported that Apple is currently aiming to launch the new iPad Pro and iPad Air models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">in "early May,"</a> and he said production of the devices has already been ramping up in Asia. He said Apple was still finishing iPadOS software development for the new iPads, and added that advanced OLED display manufacturing techniques have also contributed to the delayed launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce the following products:<ul><li>Two new iPad Pro models with the M3 chip, OLED displays, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">thinner enclosure</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-models-thinner-bezels-rumor/">thinner bezels</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/">matte screen option</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, other design changes, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">possibly MagSafe wireless charging</a>.</li><br/>
<li>Two new iPad Air models with the M2 chip and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, including a first-ever 12.9-inch iPad Air.</li><br/>
<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">aluminum enclosure</a>, larger trackpad, and other design tweaks.</li><br/>

		<title>iPhone 16 Rumored to Feature Even Thinner Bezels</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models will feature thinner bezels thanks to Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology, <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=27023"><em>The Elec</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-lineup-Action-button-230912.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910375" /><br/>
BRS technology allows for a more compact and efficient layout of the screen's underlying circuitry, enabling slimmer bezels without compromising on the display's performance or the device's overall form factor. This requires precise and advanced manufacturing techniques, given the complexity of tighter circuit placement and the need for bending some wiring downwards beneath the bezel.<br/>
<br/>
Display Driver ICs (DDIs), the components at the center of this manufacturing challenge, control the activation and illumination of pixels on the OLED panel. To meet Apple's requirements, LG Display is apparently diversifying its DDI supply chain, bringing on board Novatech from Taiwan alongside its existing supplier, LX Semicon. This move is designed to increase quality control while reducing costs.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear whether the slimmer bezel technology is destined for the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max, or both. It may be more likely to appear singularly in the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models since these devices are expected to see display size increases from 6.1- to 6.3-inches and 6.7- to 6.9-inches, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-design-showcased-by-dummy-models/">without a substantial increase</a> in overall size. It is also worth noting that Apple reduced the bezels of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max last year significantly more than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. Last month, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/">report coming out of Korea</a> suggested that BIS technology will come to the entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/">The Elec</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/">iPhone 16 Rumored to Feature Even Thinner Bezels</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-rumored-to-feature-even-thinner-bezels.2423511/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
