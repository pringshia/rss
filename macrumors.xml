<h3 id="release_date">Release Date</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max are expected to launch in the fall. Apple usually hosts an event every September to unveil new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, with launch following just over a week later. For more information about the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">see our comprehensive roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro in 2023, introducing a new design with a titanium frame, slimmer bezels, the Action button, a USB-C port, and more. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s upgrades will likely not be as substantial as those offered by its predecessor. As a result, most &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; users will have little reason to upgrade, but some who would appreciate a larger display, better cameras, and a dedicated button for photography and videography features may find it worthwhile.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 30 Rumored Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro-30-rumored-upgrades-compared.2419268/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-announced/">recently-launched Sports app</a> for the iPhone was updated today ahead of the NBA and NHL playoffs, which both begin this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Sports-App-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1961" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937385" /><br/>
Apple says fans will be able to "follow every matchup with added details on each series and more," but we have not noticed any immediate changes in the app after updating to the new version. The first NBA and NHL playoff series begin on Saturday, April 20, so the extra details will presumably become visible then. Some info like playoff matchups and conference standings was already available in the previous version of the app.<br/>
<br/>
Released in February, the Apple Sports app shows scores, schedules, stats, and more for a variety of leagues, such as the NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS, and Premier League. The app also displays real-time play-by-play information for ongoing games.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Sports is available for free <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-sports/id6446788829">on the App Store</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-sports/">Apple Sports</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-sports-app-updated-for-nba-and-nhl-playoffs/">Apple Sports App Updated for NBA and NHL Playoffs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sports-app-updated-for-nba-and-nhl-playoffs.2424229/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> shipments decreased by nearly 10% globally in the first quarter of 2024, hit by rapid growth in shipments by rival Chinese vendors, based on data provided by the International Data Corporation (IDC). <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-15-china.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943595" /><br/>
According to the <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52032524">IDC report</a>, Apple's shipments fell 9.6% to 50.1 million units in the first quarter, down from 55.4 million units in the same quarter the previous year. Apple experienced the most significant annual decline among the top five smartphone brands covered in the report.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung reclaimed its position as the market leader, which it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/apple-top-spot-global-smartphone-shipments/">lost to Apple the previous year</a>, by capturing a 20.8% market share with shipments of about 60.1 million units, roughly the same as last year. In 2023, its market share was 22.5% during the same period.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/IDC-global-phone-shipments-1q2024.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946467" /><br/>
In contrast, after having last year overtaken Samsung to become the top smartphone manufacturer for the first time, Apple experienced a decline in market share from 20.7% to 17.3%.<br/>
<blockquote>"While IDC expects these two companies to maintain their hold on the high end of the market, the resurgence of Huawei in China, as well as notable gains from Xiaomi, Transsion, OPPO/OnePlus, and vivo will likely have both OEMs looking for areas to expand and diversify," said Ryan Reith, group vice president at IDC Worldwide Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers.</blockquote>Apple has struggled to sustain interest in its flagship smartphone lineup in China since the company released its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series in September, which came just weeks after Huawei debuted its highly popular Mate 60 series. Interest in iPhones has also been impacted by a Beijing-backed ban from the offices of a huge number of state-owned enterprises in power generation, seaport construction, mining, manufacturing, education, and investment markets.<br/>
<br/>

Apple's drop in shipments came during a time when global first-quarter smartphone shipments actually rose 7.8% year-on-year to 289.4 million units. It was the third consecutive quarter of shipment growth across the worldwide market, according to IDC.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/idc/">IDC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-iphone-shipments-fall-globally-1q2024/">Samsung Regains Top Spot as Apple&#039;s iPhone Shipments Fall in Q1 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-regains-top-spot-as-apples-iphone-shipments-fall-in-q1-2024.2424224/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is testing a new anti-reflective optical coating technology for future iPhone cameras that could improve the quality of photos by reducing artifacts like lens flare and ghosting, claims a rumor out of Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Perspective-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928694" /><br/>
According to the news aggregator account <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223414985445&navType=by">"yeux1122" on the Naver blog</a>, citing a company source within Apple's supply chain, Apple is looking at introducing new atomic layer deposition (ALD) equipment into the iPhone camera lens manufacturing process.<br/>
<br/>
ALD involves depositing materials one atomic layer at a time onto a substrate, allowing for extremely precise control over thickness and composition. Its use allows manufacturers to apply very thin layers of materials onto semiconductor devices, including camera components.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of camera lenses, ALD can be used to apply anti-reflective coatings, which can help to reduce photographic artifacts like streaks of light and halos that can occur in the final image when a bright light source such as the sun shines directly into the lens.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/iphone-16-pro-models-rumored-features/">iPhone 16 Pro Expected Later This Year With These 12 New Features</a></li></ul><br/>
ALD can also reduce ghosting, a type of image distortion where faint, secondary images appear in the photo, typically opposite a bright light source. This happens when light reflects back and forth between the surfaces of the lens elements and the camera sensor.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, ALD-applied materials can protect against environmental damage to the camera lens system without affecting the sensor's ability to capture light effectively. <br/>
<br/>
The Naver blog claims that the manufacturing process will be applied to a "Pro model" in Apple's "next-generation" iPhone lineup, which sounds like a reference to one or both premium models in the iPhone 16 series, although given the timing of the rumor, the possibility that this method is being tested for next year's iPhone 17 Pro models should not be discounted.<br/>

Both upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">tetraprism lens with up to 5x optical zoom</a> â€“ a feature that is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max in Apple's smartphone lineup.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today said it removed Game Boy emulator iGBA from the App Store for violating the company's App Review Guidelines related to spam (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#spam">section 4.3</a>) and copyright (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#intellectual-property">section 5.2</a>), but it did not provide any specific details.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iGBA-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946239" /><br/>
iGBA was a copycat version of developer Riley Testut's <a href="https://github.com/CocoaBob/GBA4iOS">open-source GBA4iOS app</a>. The emulator rose to the top of the App Store charts <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/game-boy-emulator-in-app-store/">following its release this weekend</a>, but some people complained that the app was a blatant ripoff overlaid with ads.<br/>
<br/>
"So apparently Apple approved a knock-off of GBA4iOS," said Testut, in a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/C5u9xdDNCJ2">Threads post</a> on Saturday. "I did not give anyone permission to do this, yet it's now sitting at the top of the charts (despite being filled with ads + tracking)." He quipped that he was "so glad App Review exists to protect consumers from scams and rip-offs like this."<br/>
<br/>
An excerpt from section 5.2 of the App Review Guidelines, related to intellectual property:<blockquote>Make sure your app only includes content that you created or that you have a license to use. Your app may be removed if you've stepped over the line and used content without permission. Of course, this also means someone else's app may be removed if they've "borrowed" from your work.</blockquote>It is unclear if Apple removed iGBA because it felt the app ripped off GBA4iOS, or for other reasons. We have asked Apple for clarification about the app's removal, and we will update this article if we receive any additional information.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, iGBA allows iPhone users to load any Game Boy game ROMs downloaded from the web, but the app's removal makes it unclear if Apple will allow ROM-loading apps on the App Store. On its <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55888/~/intellectual-property-%26-piracy-faq">customer support website</a> in the U.S., Nintendo says downloading pirated copies of its games is illegal. It is unclear if Nintendo contacted Apple.<br/>
<br/>
iGBA appeared in the App Store just over a week after Apple allowed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">"retro game console emulators"</a> on the App Store, but the guidelines are somewhat vague, so hopefully Apple will clarify exactly what is and is not permitted. iGBA can continue to be used by anyone who installed it on their iPhone before it was removed from the App Store.<br/>

Testut has not said whether he will make his newer Nintendo game emulator <a href="https://faq.deltaemulator.com/">Delta</a> available on the App Store, should it be permitted, but he does plan to distribute it through his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/altstore-eu-iphone-patreon/">alternative app marketplace AltStore</a> on iPhones in the EU.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> Apple says that while iGBA's functionality was approved, it removed the app from the App Store after learning that it was a knockoff app that copied another developer's submission, which presumably refers to GBA4iOS.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emulator/">Emulator</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-removes-igba-from-app-store/">Apple Removes Game Boy Emulator iGBA From App Store Due to Spam and Copyright Violations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-game-boy-emulator-igba-from-app-store-due-to-spam-and-copyright-violations.2424202/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman recently reported that the first Macs with M4 series chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/m4-ai-chips-late-2024/">will be released later this year</a>, with more models to follow next year. In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-14/humane-ai-pin-review-the-device-isn-t-going-to-kill-apple-s-iphone-luziqlew"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman shared a more specific roadmap for these Macs.<br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-14/humane-ai-pin-review-the-device-isn-t-going-to-kill-apple-s-iphone-luziqlew">Here is the order</a> in which Gurman expects the Macs to launch:<blockquote>1. A low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4, coming around the end of 2024.<br/>
2. A 24-inch iMac with the M4, also expected around the end of the year.<br/>
3. New 14-inch and 16-inch high-end MacBook Pros with M4 Pro/Max chips, due between the end of 2024 and early 2025.<br/>
4. A Mac mini in both M4 and M4 Pro configurations, coming between the end of 2024 and early 2025.<br/>
5. New 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs, slated for around spring 2025.<br/>
6. A Mac Studio with a high-end M4 chip, coming around the middle of 2025.<br/>
7. A Mac Pro with an M4 Ultra chip, due in the second half of 2025.</blockquote>Gurman reiterated that Apple has internally tested an M3 Ultra chip, which would be suitable for the Mac Studio and the Mac Pro, but he said it is "all but assured that at least some of Apple's high-end desktops" will skip the M3 chip series.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said that Apple will emphasize the artificial intelligence capabilities of the M4 chip series.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/when-are-m4-macs-launching/">M4 Macs Are Expected to Launch in This Order Starting Later This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-macs-are-expected-to-launch-in-this-order-starting-later-this-year.2424174/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's first set of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new AI features planned for iOS 18</a> will not rely on cloud servers at all, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-14/humane-ai-pin-review-the-device-isn-t-going-to-kill-apple-s-iphone-luziqlew"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Siri-Integrated-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945741" /><br/>
"As the world awaits Apple's big AI unveiling on June 10, it looks like the initial wave of features will work entirely on device," said Gurman, in the Q&A section of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-14/humane-ai-pin-review-the-device-isn-t-going-to-kill-apple-s-iphone-luziqlew"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today. "That means there's no cloud processing component to the company's large language model, the software that powers the new capabilities."<br/>
<br/>
Apple will probably still offer some cloud-based AI features powered by Google's Gemini or another provider, according to Gurman. Apple has reportedly held discussions with companies <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/">such as Google, OpenAI, and China's Baidu</a> about potential generative AI partnerships. iOS 18 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/ios-18-reportedly-wont-have-apple-chatbot/">not expected to include Apple's own ChatGPT-like chatbot</a>, but it is unclear if Gemini or other chatbot will be directly integrated into iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that Apple could offer some of its own cloud-based generative AI features in the future, as Apple supply chain analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and Jeff Pu have said that the company is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-ai-server-spending-2024/">actively purchasing AI servers</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features</a> for the iPhone's Spotlight search tool, Siri, Safari, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more. Gurman previously reported that generative AI will improve Siri's ability to answer more complex questions, and allow the Messages app to auto-complete sentences.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to unveil iOS 18 and other software updates at its annual developers conference WWDC, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">runs from June 10 through June 14</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/apples-first-ios-18-ai-features-no-cloud/">Apple&#039;s First AI Features in iOS 18 Reportedly Won&#039;t Use Cloud Servers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-ai-features-in-ios-18-reportedly-wont-use-cloud-servers.2424167/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

In addition to this &#36;700 discount, you'll find deals on <a href="https://howl.me/clLNSBlHkaL">4K and 5K Samsung monitors</a>, including the Smart Monitor M8, as well as storage, audio, TVs, smartphones, and home appliances.<br/>

<br/>
Overall, the ViewFinity S9 5K Smart Monitor is at a very solid second-best price this weekend, just &#36;50 higher compared to the previous record low price. This monitor has a matte display, modular 4K SlimFit camera, and support for Thunderbolt 4.<br/>

This is a 4K smart monitor with a design that looks similar to the iMac line, and it's at another great second-best price during Samsung's monitor sale.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A week after Apple updated its App Review Guidelines to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">permit retro game console emulators</a>, a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/igba-gba-gbc-retro-emulator/id6482993626">Game Boy emulator for the iPhone called iGBA</a> has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/1c35zop/new_gba_and_gbc_emulator_on_app_store/">appeared in the App Store</a> worldwide. The emulator is already one of the top free apps on the App Store charts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iGBA-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946239" /><br/>
<br/>
It was not entirely clear if Apple would allow emulators to work with all and any games, but iGBA is able to load any Game Boy ROMs that users download from the web and open via the Files app on the iPhone. Accordingly, it seems like there are no game restrictions for emulators, unless Apple mistakenly approved iGBA on the App Store.<br/>
<br/>
iGBA works with Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games. It is important to note that it can be illegal to possess certain ROMs from game developers, but <a href="https://hh.gbdev.io/">homebrew Game Boy games</a> are typically in the clear.<br/>
<br/>
iGBA <a href="https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/C5u9xdDNCJ2">appears to be a copy</a> of Riley Testut's <a href="https://github.com/CocoaBob/GBA4iOS">open-source GBA4iOS emulator</a>, but with ads that can track users. GBA4iOS is the predecessor to Testut's current Nintendo game emulator <a href="https://faq.deltaemulator.com/">Delta</a>, which can be installed on the iPhone outside of the App Store, and will soon be available through his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/altstore-eu-iphone-patreon/">alternative app marketplace AltStore</a> on iPhones in the EU. It is not clear if Testut plans to make Delta available in the App Store following the rule change.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> As noted <a href="https://www.threads.net/@parkerortolani/post/C5wo4-CPcrU">by Parker Ortolani</a>, the iGBA emulator has been removed from the App Store. Apple told us it removed the app for violating the company's app review guidelines <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-removes-igba-from-app-store/">related to spam and copyright</a>, after learning that it was a knockoff app that copied another developer's submission (likely referring to GBA4iOS).<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emulator/">Emulator</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/game-boy-emulator-in-app-store/">Game Boy Emulator for iPhone Now Available in App Store Following Rule Change [Removed]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/game-boy-emulator-for-iphone-now-available-in-app-store-following-rule-change-removed.2424159/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's hardware roadmap was in the news this week, with things hopefully firming up for a launch of updated iPad Pro and iPad Air models next month while we look ahead to the other iPad models and a full lineup of M4-based Macs arriving starting later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/top-stories-13apr2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946171" /><br/>
We also heard some fresh rumors about iOS 18, due to be unveiled at WWDC in a couple of months, while we took a look at how things are going with the iPhone 15 Pro now that it's halfway through its flagship lifecycle, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Macs to Get AI-Focused M4 Chips Starting in Late 2024</h2><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/m4-ai-chips-late-2024/">release its first Macs with the M4 series of chips in late 2024</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-AI-Optimized-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945901" /><br/>
The report says that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> lines will be the first to be updated with the M4 series of chips later this year, while other models like the MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro are expected to be updated with M4 series chips throughout 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said the chips are "designed to highlight artificial intelligence" capabilities on the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New iPads Likely to Launch During Second Week of May</h2><br/>
In the latest edition of his newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said new iPad Pro and iPad Air models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/gurman-new-ipads-first-week-of-may/">will likely launch during the second week of May</a>, following reported <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/apple-suppliers-say-new-ipads-repeatedly-postponed/">manufacturing delays</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
He also said Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/when-to-expect-next-ipad-mini/">working on new iPad mini and entry-level iPad models</a>, but he does not expect those devices to launch until later this year.<br/>
<br/>
It has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipad-launched-14-years-ago/">nearly 18 months since Apple last released new iPads</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Review: Six Months With the iPhone 15 Pro</h2><br/>
It's been a bit over six months since the iPhone 15 lineup came out in September, and <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera has been using an iPhone 15 Pro Max sans case since launch. Over on our YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/iphone-15-pro-six-month-review/">Dan did a long-term review</a> to demo how his phone has held up and his thoughts on the Action button, battery life, and camera features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPhone-15-6-Months-Later-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945764" /><br/>
If you're an â€ŒiPhone 15 Proâ€Œ owner, let us know how your battery life is holding up, whether you're regularly using the Action button, and anything else you've found interesting about your experience with Apple's latest high-end flagship phone!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Here Are All the Rumored iPhone 16 Colors</h2><br/>
We recently recapped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/all-the-rumored-iphone-16-colors/">all rumored color options for the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, so be sure to check out the list to learn about the new options expected.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Colors.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935159" /><br/>
At least two new color options are rumored for the lower-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</a> models, including Purple and White, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">Pro models</a> could gain new Space Black and Rose Gold titanium finishes.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 May Feature All-New 'Safari Browsing Assistant'</h2><br/>
One of the new generative AI features rumored to be coming to the iPhone with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> could be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-18-safari-browsing-assistant-rumor/">browsing assistant in Safari</a>, according to backend code discovered on Apple's servers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-18-WWDC-24-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944197" /><br/>
While no specific details about the browsing assistant are known, the feature could allow Safari to better compete with other AI-infused web browsers available on the iPhone, such as Microsoft Edge and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/arc-search-iphone-app-ai/">Arc Search</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Workflow was a unique iOS app that allowed users to create macros for executing specific sequential tasks on their device. In 2017, Apple acquired Workflow and, the following year, it was rebranded as "Shortcuts." Shortcuts have since become a key part of Apple's ecosystem and can be used for a huge range of powerful, automated actions. Matthew was present at Workflow throughout its transition to Apple and now offers his own library of complex Shortcuts, which you can <a href="https://matthewcassinelli.com">access over on his website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">report from <em>The Information</em></a> claimed that &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will introduce some major AI features to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and the Shortcuts app. Apple apparently wants â€Œ&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;â€Œ to be able to help users automate complex, multi-step tasks with voice-based commands and have much deeper integration with Shortcuts, such as by potentially helping users build them.<br/>
<br/>
We break down Apple Shortcuts for beginners and look at some of the many use-cases for the app, as well as consider where it could go next with AI. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> is now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips going forward:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/">Pixelmator Pro 3.5.8</a> has gone live on the Mac App Store, and the latest update to the popular image editing app brings the ability to edit text in PDFs, along with a handful of other notable additions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/pixelmator-pro-pdf-text-editing.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946030" /><br/>
Pixelmator recently added support to the app for vector PDFs, which allows users to import image, shape, and text elements in the portable document format as separate layers. <br/>
<br/>
With the newest version, this support has been expanded so that users can edit imported text as regular text layers. In practice, this means existing text in PDFs can be more easily replaced, formatted, and styled using Pixelmator Pro tools. As the developers explain:<br/>
<blockquote>Typically, text in PDF documents is not directly editable. Instead, it's stored as vector shapes to keep documents looking consistent across various platforms and apps. To make text editable again, Pixelmator Pro extracts various embedded data from the original PDF, allowing it to recover the original text, fonts, and formatting. Even if some of these elements are missing, for instance, if the original font is not installed on your Mac, you can still import the text, select a different font, and continue with your edits.</blockquote>In addition, the new text editing abilities mean users can seamlessly export Apple Keynote and Pages projects and continue editing them in Pixelmator Pro. All text remains fully editable in its original fonts, including the SF Pro font that is used throughout the Apple ecosystem.  <br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in this update, the Style tool has been improved to simplify the creation of custom outlines around text layers. Users now have the option to add strokes inside, within, or outside of the text, choose from various stroke ends and corners, and also add dashed strokes.<br/>
<br/>
Pixelmator Pro 3.5.8 also includes 12 new templates for web, social media, and more. All of the templates include a set of alternative color palettes for adjusting the theme to custom requirements. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/">Pixelmator Pro</a> is available exclusively <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/pixelmator-pro/id1289583905">from the Mac App Store</a> as a free update for existing users and &#36;49.99 for new customers.

		<description><![CDATA[Several third-party browser companies have experienced a spike in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> installs since Apple made major changes to iOS in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act in the European Union, but many are not happy with Apple's implementation of its default browser choice screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alternative-browser-list-eu.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941009" /><br/>
In iOS 17.4, released last month, Apple no longer limits EU users to the handful of browser options that iOS currently offers as alternatives in other parts of the world. Instead, users in the EU who open Safari for the first time are presented with a choice screen that allows them to opt for a new default browser from a list of popular alternatives in their country.<br/>
<br/>
The change has led to a sharp increase in third-party browser usage, based on several reports. On Wednesday, <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-new-tech-laws-are-working-small-browsers-gain-market-share-2024-04-10/">Reuters</a></em> reported that users of privacy-first browser Aloha had jumped 250% in March. The jump in users largely came in France, Belgium (3x growth), Germany, The Netherlands, Spain and Sweden (2.5x growth), and Denmark, Italy and Poland (2x growth).<br/>
<br/>
Aloha browser markets itself as a privacy focused alternative to browsers that earns its money through paid subscriptions rather than selling ads by tracking users. The Cyprus-based company says it has 10 million monthly average users.<br/>
<br/>
"Before, EU was our number four market, right now it's number two," Aloha CEO Andrew Frost Moroz said in an interview with <em>Reuters</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Norway's Vivaldi browser, Germany's Ecosia and U.S.-based Brave have all seen user numbers rise following the new regulation. U.S.-based DuckDuckGo, which has about 100 million users, and its more popular rival, Norway-based Opera, have also reported substantial increases.<br/>
<br/>
To be eligible for consideration in the alternative browsers list, companies must have the Default Browser Entitlement that is available to developers. Apple also requires that the app has been downloaded by at least 5,000 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; usersâ€Œ across all 27 EU countries in the prior calendar year. Apple selects up to 11 of these for the browser choice screen in addition to Safari, updating the list once per calendar year. <br/>
<br/>
Google has also updated its Pixel software to show alternative browser choices, and says that new Android devices made by other companies will also display the choice screen in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
Despite users increasingly choosing alternative options, browser companies have criticized Apple and Google for the slow rollout of the change, and believe it is hampering the migration away from Safari and Chrome. Mozilla, which owns Firefox, estimates that only around a fifth of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in the EU have received the iOS update, and claims that the rollout is much slower than Apple's previous software updates.<br/>
<br/>
Some alternative browser makers are also concerned that the design of choice screens is sub-optimal at best. For example, Vivaldi CEO Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner notes that Apple's choice screen only appears when &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users open Safari, while the list of browsers provides no additional information. <br/>
<br/>
"The process is just so convoluted that it's easiest for (users) to select Safari or potentially some other known name," he told <em>Reuters</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Vivaldi is also unhappy with the design. "The list of browsers does not show additional information and that does not help users to make a meaningful choice," a company spokesperson told <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/eu-dma-browser-choice-screen-early-impact/">TechCrunch</a></em>. "If the user has already selected a browser of their own choice, the choice screen can actively try to push them away from it, and may not even include it in the list that it presents to the user."<br/>
<br/>
Ecosia has also been critical, and says Apple's implementation involves an "overly complex installation process" and keeps Safari front and center on the user's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Home screen.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/eu-to-investigate-apple-dma-compliance/">investigating</a> Apple's choice screen design for suspected noncompliance. The probe is being conducted in consultation with browser companies, who are likely to encourage regulators to push for a stronger implementation to level the competitive playing field. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/apple-eu-default-browser-options-criticized/">Browser Companies Criticize Apple&#039;s EU Choice Screen in iOS 17.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/browser-companies-criticize-apples-eu-choice-screen-in-ios-17-4.2424048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google One VPN will be discontinued later this year, according to a customer email seen by <em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/vpn-by-google-one-shut-down-3433530/">Android Authority</a></em>. The service was rolled out for Android in October 2020, before coming to iOS devices and Macs in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/google-one-vpn-fixed.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="883" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-835722" /><br/>
When it originally launched it was part of Google One's Premium 2TB storage plan, priced at &#36;9.99 per month or &#36;99.99 per year. Last year, availability was expanded to all <a href="https://one.google.com">Google One</a> plans, including the cheapest offering for &#36;1.99 per month, making it significantly more affordable.<br/>
<br/>
The company told <em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/11/google-one-vpn-discontinued/">9to5Google</a></em> that it is killing the service because "people simply weren't using it." Existing users will be directed to third-party VPN alternatives instead.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo today announced the launch of <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/meetprivacypro/">Privacy Pro</a>, a new subscription service that bundles three privacy-focused features together.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/duckduckgo-privacy-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945898" /><br/>
Privacy Pro includes a VPN for anonymous browsing and secure connections regardless of location, personal information removal for removing personal data from data broker sites, and identity theft restoration should any DuckDuckGo subscriber suffer from an identity theft situation.<br/>
<br/>
The VPN works on up to five devices simultaneously, so it can be installed and used on a Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and other devices at the same time. It is turned on through the DuckDuckGo browser so a second app is not required, and it does filter traffic through all apps and browsers.<br/>
<br/>
DuckDuckGo's personal information removal tool regularly scans 50 sites that sell information, such as Spokeo. Personal information is stored on device, and removal requests are initiated using the information provided during setup. The process is automated, and there is a dashboard to monitor results.<br/>
<br/>
Identity theft restoration includes the support of a dedicated advisor that will work with users to restore stolen accounts, replace bank cards and other identifying documents, recover financial losses, and correct credit reports.<br/>
<br/>
Privacy Pro from DuckDuckGo is <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/meetprivacypro/">priced at &#36;9.99 per month</a> or &#36;99.99 per year, and it is currently only available in the United States. Users will need to ensure they are using the latest version of the DuckDuckGo browser to take advantage of the features.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duckduckgo/">DuckDuckGo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/duckduckgo-privacy-pro-subscription/">DuckDuckGo Launches 3-in-1 &#039;Privacy Pro&#039; Subscription With VPN and Personal Data Removal Tool</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/duckduckgo-launches-3-in-1-privacy-pro-subscription-with-vpn-and-personal-data-removal-tool.2424020/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular home lighting company <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/">Nanoleaf</a> today introduced its latest product, Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights that bring HomeKit-compatible decorative lighting to decks, porches, backyards, gardens, pool areas, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-outdoor-lights-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945596" /><br/>
Nanoleaf is known for unique light designs, and the Outdoor String Lights aren't an exception. The bulbs have an angular five-sided shape that makes them more geometric than soft. They're made from a hard, clear plastic material and they look like they're made from crystal or ice. If you want cozy, romantic-style lighting, Nanoleaf's lights might not be the right vibe because of the shape, but if you want lights that are fun and eye-catching, these are perfect.<br/>
<br/>
There are multicolor LEDs in each bulb, so you can control the lights individually and set them to any color, including shades of white. If you unscrew one of the bulbs, there's actually a second protective plastic dome inside that further diffuses the light. The bulb shape might not have a cozy feel, but the lights can be soft yellows and whites, or any other shade of the rainbow, plus there are dimming controls. The colors are accurate and it does well with blues, purples, and greens, shades that can sometimes be off with LED lighting.<br/>
<br/>
The Outdoor String Lights are meant for ambient lighting, and even at 100 percent brightness, they're on the dimmer side depending on the colors used. Nanoleaf says they're 55 lumens per bulb, so a 15-meter strand is 1100 lumens total. These are available in 15-meter (49ft) and 30-meter lengths (98ft), with the 15-meter version offering 20 bulbs and the 30-meter version offering 40 bulbs. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-outdoor-lights-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945597" /><br/>
Strands can be connected together, but the maximum length is 45 meters or 147 feet, equivalent to one 30-meter strand and one 15-meter expansion. For anything longer, you'll need separate sets with multiple power supplies. The lights have thick black cabling for weather protection, so these are probably not string lights you're going to want to use indoors unless you have a room where an industrial look works.<br/>
<br/>
There's 6.5 feet of cord between the power supply and the controller and then another foot or so between the controller and the first light. The bulbs are spaced about two feet apart, and they hang down four inches, so they look best when draped down across beams or using outdoor light poles.<br/>
<br/>
The lights have IP65 water resistance and the controller is IP67 rated, so they can be used outdoors in the rain and elements without protection all year. Nanoleaf offers a two-year warranty on the lights.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-outdoor-lights-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="2000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945598" /><br/>
In terms of aesthetics, the Nanoleaf Outdoor Lights are great, but connectivity needs improvement. These connect to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> through Matter, and Matter devices continue to face issues on Apple's platform. I think it's more of an Apple issue than a Nanoleaf issue because I see these same Matter problems regardless of device, but it's a problem any potential buyer needs to be aware of.<br/>
<br/>
The Outdoor String Lights have randomly disconnected or become unreachable for no particular reason a handful of times. Sometimes unplugging them fixes it, and sometimes they just start working again after being unreachable. As a caveat, I don't know if the Matter/&zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; interoperability issue I have is exacerbated by my Wi-Fi network or other factors. I have an Orbi mesh Wi-Fi 6E network, and while my standard &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; products seem to generally be reliable (especially those with hubs), Matter is not. The Outdoor String Lights are mostly functional and the disconnects aren't constant, but it is worth noting that the lights may not always work seamlessly for &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; users.<br/>
<br/>
I would have preferred native &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; support to Matter for the lights, but these are Matter only. There is no Thread support, and as with other Nanoleaf products, you can only use a 2.4GHz network.<br/>
<br/>
On a more positive note, Nanoleaf has one of the better smart home apps. There are built-in scenes available in the app for the Outdoor String Lights, but I can also create my own or use scenes created by other Nanoleaf users. Nanoleaf also has an AI feature where you can type in any phrase like "tropical sunset" or "ocean waves" to get a custom scene in colors that match what you're aiming for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/nanoleaf-outdoor-lights-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945599" /><br/>
The AI works with a fairly wide range of suggestions, and I get a good range of colors. The only downside is that it appears to have a single color-shifting pattern, but Nanoleaf does support other patterns when you create your own scenes or download them. As these are able to connect to &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; via Matter, you can use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> commands and turn them on and off with the Home app.<br/>
<br/>
The Home app also supports automations for turning the Outdoor Lights on and off at select times or pairing them with other &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
The Nanoleaf Outdoor String Lights are some of the neatest outdoor lights that I've seen, and the multicolored LEDs pair well with the geometric shape. These are expensive and are not cost efficient if you have a large area to cover in lights, but one or two strands will elevate any outdoor setup.<br/>
<br/>
I have not seen flawless operation from the Outdoor String Lights, and have had to deal with some disconnects, so that's something to be aware of. I am hopeful that Apple and Nanoleaf updates in the future will fix any of the lingering issues that Matter-enabled devices are still experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2><br/>
Nanoleaf's Outdoor String Lights can be <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/essentials/outdoor/multicolor-string-lights/">purchased from the Nanoleaf website</a>. A 15-meter strand is priced at &#36;100, and a 30-meter strand is priced at &#36;180. Additional 15-meter expansion packs are available for &#36;70.<br/>
