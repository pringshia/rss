		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> launched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/youtube-spotify-vision-pro/">without a few key apps</a>, such as Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify. A YouTube app could be coming in the future, though, according to a statement the company gave to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/5/24062425/youtube-vision-pro-app-360-vr-video">The Verge</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/General-YouTube-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-814336" /><br/>
YouTube says that it is "excited" by the Vision Pro launch and that an app is on the company's roadmap, but no timing was provided. YouTube's full statement:<br/>
<blockquote>We're excited to see Vision Pro launch and we're supporting it by ensuring YouTube users have a great experience in Safari. We do not have any specific plans to share at this time, but can confirm that a Vision Pro app is on our roadmap.</blockquote><br/>
YouTube and parent company Google have sometimes taken <em>years</em> to adopt new Apple features, so it is entirely unclear when we might actually see a YouTube app for the device. In the meantime, Apollo developer Christian Selig <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/juno-app-youtube-apple-vision-pro/">has created an app</a> called "Juno" for watching YouTube on the Vision Pro. Alternatively, YouTube videos can be watched from the Safari browser.<br/>
<br/>
Neither Juno nor YouTube on the web work allow Vision Pro owners to watch YouTube's collection of 360 and 3D videos. An Apple spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em> that this is because the content "was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience."<br/>
<blockquote>In some cases, this content could also cause motion discomfort. We've focused our efforts on delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.</blockquote><br/>
There is no word on whether YouTube's eventual app will work with its 3D content.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did say that it is working on supporting WebXR content which could eventually allow for YouTube VR videos to be viewable on the web using Safari, but it is still a new standard. WebXR doesn't yet "take full advantage of the power, performance and interaction capabilities of &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>," but Apple is contributing to W3C web standards including WebXR.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/">YouTube</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/youtube-vision-pro-app-on-roadmap/">YouTube Claims an Apple Vision Pro App is On the Roadmap</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-claims-an-apple-vision-pro-app-is-on-the-roadmap.2418560/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<h2>AirPods</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/AirPods-Valentine-Deal.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-782131" /><br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few AirPods deals going on in early February on Amazon, including big savings on the AirPods 2, AirPods 3, and AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C. Starting with the cheapest model, the AirPods 2 are available for &#36;89.99, down from &#36;129.00.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;39 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for &#36;89.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The AirPods 3 have dropped to &#36;139.99 on Amazon, down from &#36;169.00. This is the model with the Lightning Charging Case, and this sale is a match of the all-time low price on the AirPods 3.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;29 OFF</div>AirPods 3 for &#36;139.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Finally, Amazon has the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.99, down from &#36;249.00. This is another match of an all-time low price, and an overall great deal on the newest model of AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><h2>Apple Watch</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/watch-heart-valentines-deal.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-836619" /><br/>
<br/>
The best Apple Watch-related deals you can find right now are on the second generation Apple Watch SE. The 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE has hit &#36;189.00 on Amazon, down from &#36;249.00, while the 44mm GPS model is available for &#36;219.00, down from &#36;279.00.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8RVB8%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;60 OFF</div>Apple Watch SE (40mm GPS) for &#36;189.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5W8YM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;60 OFF</div>Apple Watch SE (44mm GPS) for &#36;219.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Series 9 deals aren't as steep, but are still notable if you're shopping for an Apple Watch this month. You can get the 41mm GPS Apple Watch Series 9 for &#36;329.00 on Amazon, down from &#36;399.00, and the 45mm GPS model for &#36;359.00, down from &#36;429.00. <a href="https://howl.me/clztYrRobwN">These prices are being matched at Best Buy</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX1RVMT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;70 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm GPS) for &#36;329.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX6SF1J%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;70 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm GPS) for &#36;359.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Finally for Apple Watches, it's worth noting the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is down to an all-time low price of &#36;737.99 on Amazon, down from &#36;799.00. Only the Indigo Alpine Loop in Medium is available at this price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7J5Z3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;61 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;737.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
As of last month, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/">sales ban was reenacted</a> in the United States on any Apple Watch model sold by Apple that has blood oxygen sensing. While Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models purchased directly from Apple currently come with blood oxygen sensing disabled, retailers like Best Buy are able to continue selling through their existing stocks that include the feature.<br/>
<h2>iPad</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/iPad-Valentine-Deal.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-782130" /><br/>
<br/>
Right now Amazon has Apple's 9th and 10th generation iPad at numerous record low prices, starting at just &#36;249.00 for the 64GB Wi-Fi 9th generation iPad. You can also get the 256GB Wi-Fi iPad for &#36;379.00, which is &#36;100 off and an all-time low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;80 OFF</div>64GB Wi-Fi 9th Gen iPad for &#36;249.00</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G96TFF7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>256GB Wi-Fi 9th Gen iPad for &#36;379.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are even more 10th generation iPads on sale on Amazon, with nearly every model getting a best-ever price. This includes both Wi-Fi and cellular tablets, starting at &#36;349.00 for the 64GB Wi-Fi iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMV%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>64GB Wi-Fi 10th Gen iPad for &#36;349.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Lastly, there are a few iPad mini models on sale on Amazon, but only on the 64GB Wi-Fi model. You can get this tablet in multiple colors for &#36;399.99, down from &#36;499.00, a solid second-best price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9FW785%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;99 OFF</div>64GB Wi-Fi iPad mini for &#36;399.99</div></a></div><h2>MacBook</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> is installed on 76 percent of iPhones released in the last four years, according to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/">newly released iOS 17 adoption statistics</a> provided today by Apple. This is the first time that Apple has given us &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; installation numbers since the operating system was released last September.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iOS-17-Adoption-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-934949" /><br/>
20 percent of iPhones released in the last four years are still running iOS 16, while four percent run an earlier operating system. Of all active iPhones, 66 percent are running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, 23 percent are running iOS 16, and 11 percent are running an earlier version of iOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also shared iPadOS installation numbers. 61 percent of iPads introduced in the last four years have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> installed, while 29 percent have iPadOS 16, and 10 percent are running an earlier version of iPadOS.<br/>
<br/>
Among all active iPads, 53 percent have &zwnj;iPadOS 17&zwnj;, 29 percent have iPadOS 16, and 18 percent run an earlier version of the iPadOS software.<br/>
<br/>
Around this time last year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/16/ios-16-adoption-stats-from-apple/">81 percent of all iPhones</a> introduced in the last four years had iOS 16 installed, so &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; adoption has been slower. Only 53 percent of iPads were running iPadOS 16 in February 2023, however, so the pace of &zwnj;iPadOS 17&zwnj; adoption has been faster than iPadOS 16 adoption.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; was first released in September, and Apple has released three major updates so far. A fourth major update, iOS 17.4, is set to come out in March.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/apple-shares-ios-17-adoption-numbers/">iOS 17 Adoption is Slower Than iOS 16 Adoption</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-adoption-is-slower-than-ios-16-adoption.2418553/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vn4toshi">today began accepting submissions</a> for its 2024 Swift Student Challenge. Apple's annual challenges ask students to create an innovative coding project using the Swift Playgrounds app.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932478" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/swift-student-challenge-2024.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/swift-student-challenge-february-2024/">first announced plans</a> for an early 2024 launch in November 2023, giving students plenty of time to prepare for this year's event.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will select 350 winners for this year's challenge, and there will be a category that recognizes a total of 50 Distinguished Winners for standout submissions. The Distinguished Winners will be invited to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, where they will be able to connect with their peers and the Apple team, and all 350 winners will be granted a free one-year membership in the Apple Developer program, a complimentary voucher to take an App Development with Swift certification exam, and a special gift from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been holding an annual Swift Student Challenge for several years now, but it is typically announced when Apple provides dates the Worldwide Developers Conference. Past winners have been invited to attend WWDC, and Apple says that this year's 50 Distinguished Winners will be invited to Cupertino "next summer," so the planned invite could again be tied to WWDC.<br/>
<br/>
Students will have three weeks to submit their app playgrounds to Apple, and applications must be submitted by February 25. Apple judges entries on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and content of written responses explaining the project.<br/>
<br/>
Eligible students include those enrolled in an accredited academic institution (or an official homeschool equivalent), a STEM organization's educational curriculum, or an Apple Developer Academy. Apple also accepts applications from developers who have graduated from high school or the equivalent in the past six months and are awaiting acceptance to an accredited academic institution.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/swift-playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/apple-2024-swift-student-challenge/">Apple&#039;s 2024 Swift Student Challenge Now Live</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-2024-swift-student-challenge-now-live.2418547/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting today, you can receive a free Vision Pro demo at any Apple Store in the U.S. on an appointment basis. You can reserve a time slot up to seven days in advance <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/instore-shopping-session/session-selection/?topic=visionpro">on Apple's website</a>, or by using the Apple Store app on your iPhone or iPad.<br/>

During the 30-minute demo experience, guided by an Apple retail employee, you will learn how to navigate the visionOS operating system as you explore a few built-in apps, including Apple TV, Photos, and Safari. The employee will make sure the Vision Pro properly fits you, and provide the correct ZEISS optical inserts for vision correction if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
At select stores, Apple has created a special "Demo Zone" with curved sofas and rugs to create a more comfortable and homey feel. Apple Store expert Michael Steeber provided more details about the demo experience <a href="https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/p/the-big-demo">in his Tabletops newsletter</a> today. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-launch-day/">launched in the U.S. on Friday</a>, and there are already several YouTube videos that demonstrate using the headset for remote work, gaming, in-flight entertainment, watching sports, and more. We have rounded up these videos below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Vision-Pro-Airplane.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934834" /><br/>
If you want to experience the Vision Pro for yourself, you can <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/instore-shopping-session/?topic=visionpro">book an appointment for a free Vision Pro demo</a> at any Apple Store in the U.S. on Apple's website. During the demo, which can take up to 30 minutes, you will learn how to navigate the visionOS operating system, and explore built-in apps such as Apple TV, Photos, and Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Working at Home</h2><br/>
Himels Tech demonstrated using the Vision Pro at home for work, entertainment, and more:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BV9Xy6L_rlM?si=AcSvV-nJ7It3R8wC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
In the video, he walks around and shows off several visionOS app windows pinned at his desk, in the living room, and in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro can be used as an external display for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/apple-vision-pro-can-display-intel-macs/">any Mac compatible with macOS Sonoma</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Gaming</h2><br/>
Wynnsanity tested gaming on the Vision Pro:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmYNLndZZIs?si=0Qw6L-A7MgWnKqU1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Most controllers that are compatible with the iPhone or iPad also work with the Vision Pro, including wireless PlayStation and Xbox controllers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Traveling on Airplane</h2><br/>
Gravel took the Vision Pro on an airplane and used the headset as a virtual seat-back screen:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bbQC2YSshM?si=d94_CLzxxG7a74r-&amp;start=564" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-travel/">features a Travel Mode</a> that adapts to the "unique motion and environment of commercial air travel" to give you the "best experience while traveling on an airplane," according to Apple. Travel Mode can be turned on in Control Center.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the Vision Pro should not be worn during taxiing, takeoff, and landing, and while a flight has turbulence. Apple also says to avoid looking out an airplane's windows, as this could affect the headset's ability to track your surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Watching Sports</h2><br/>
In his excellent Vision Pro review last week, Brian Tong showed what it is like to use the NBA app:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GkPw6ScHyb4?si=pPkaXKS9lG_2F_5t&amp;start=898" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
With the NBA app and an NBA League Pass subscription, you can watch up to five basketball games live or on demand at once. You can also view real-time player stats, game scores, and other information at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>In Public</h2><br/>
Casey Neistat wore the Vision Pro on the New York City subway and at Times Square:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvkgmyfMPks?si=3kXBFlAKxg5nByK4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last month confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released in March, and the update includes several new features and changes for the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
Key new features in iOS 17.4 include major App Store changes in the EU, Apple Podcasts transcripts, SharePlay for the HomePod, and new emoji. The update also includes preparations for the launch of next-generation CarPlay later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">press release</a> confirmation that iOS 17.4 will be released in March:<blockquote>Inevitably, the new options for developers' EU apps create new risks to Apple users and their devices. Apple can't eliminate those risks, but within the DMA's constraints, the company will take steps to reduce them. These safeguards will be in place <strong>when users download iOS 17.4 or later, beginning in March</strong>.</blockquote>More details about the new features and changes in iOS 17.4 follow.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Store Changes in EU</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-ios-app-store-safari-changes.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933983" /><br/>
To comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act, Apple announced major changes to the App Store, Apple Pay, Safari, and more. These changes will be implemented with iOS 17.4 for iPhone users who reside in the <a href="https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/eu-eea-efta-schengen-countries">27 countries</a> that belong to the EU.<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost, Apple now allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">alternative app marketplaces</a> and alternative payment options on the App Store in the EU. Other changes in the EU include a new default web browser selection screen in Safari, the ability for third-party web browsers to use web engines other than Apple's WebKit on the iPhone, the ability for third-party mobile wallet apps to access the iPhone's NFC chip for contactless payment functionality, and more.<br/>
<br/>
For more details, read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">recap of all of the EU changes in iOS 17.4</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/">Apple's overview</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Podcasts Transcripts</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Podcasts-Transcriptions.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934710" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 17.4, the Apple Podcasts app now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-search-transcripts-podcasts-app/">offers transcripts for podcasts</a>, allowing listeners to read the full text of an episode, search for a specific word or phrase, and tap on the text to jump to a certain part of the episode. As an episode plays, each word is highlighted, similar to Apple Music song lyrics.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/5316-transcripts-on-apple-podcasts">Apple says</a> it automatically generates transcripts after a new episode is published. Transcripts are available for podcasts in English, French, German, and Spanish, and they will be added for older episodes in a podcast's catalog over time.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>SharePlay for HomePod</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933114" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 17.4, Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/">expanded SharePlay music control to HomePod speakers</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This feature allows family and friends to control the music that is playing on your HomePod, if you approve their request. For now, it is limited to the Music app, and the other people do not require an Apple Music subscription in order to participate.<br/>
<br/>
While playing a song on your iPhone, tap the SharePlay icon at the bottom of the screen to bring up a QR code, which another person can scan with their iPhone or Android smartphone's camera to request access to music playback controls. Even a screenshot of the QR code suffices, allowing you to remotely grant access to people around the world.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already rolled out a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/whats-new-carplay-ios-17/">similar feature for CarPlay</a> last year, allowing anyone in a car to control music playback via SharePlay with permission.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Emoji</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-New-Emoji-Feature-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1077" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932812" /><br/>
iOS 17.4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-adds-new-emoji/">adds new emoji</a>, including a broken chain, a brown mushroom, a head shaking horizontally, a head shaking vertically, a lime, and a phoenix.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay Preparations</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927534" /><br/>
The first iOS 17.4 beta includes code for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/">eight new CarPlay apps</a>:<ul><li><strong>Auto Settings:</strong> This app will let you manage paired iPhones and adjust vehicle settings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Car Camera:</strong> This app will display the vehicle's rear-view camera feed.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> For electric vehicles, this app will display battery level, charging status, time remaining until the battery is fully charged, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Climate:</strong> This app will provide access to a vehicle's climate controls within CarPlay, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heating system, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Closures:</strong> This app will display if any of the vehicle's doors are opened, and it might also display vehicle warning symbols.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> This app will provide access to FM and AM radio station controls within CarPlay, along with other media options like SiriusXM. It is unclear if SiriusXM will offer satellite connectivity, or remain limited to internet streaming. Users will be able to select from a list of music genres, such as Top 40 and Rock.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Tire Pressure:</strong> This app will display air pressure for each of the vehicle's tires, and provide low pressure, high pressure, and flat tire warnings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Trips:</strong> This app will provide a variety of driving-related data, including the vehicle's average speed, fuel efficiency or energy efficiency, the total time elapsed and distance traveled on a trip, and more.</li></ul>Apple recently confirmed that the first U.S. vehicle models with next-generation CarPlay will be released at some point in 2024.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is back with all-time low prices on two AirPods models, including the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C and the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case. You can also find a solid discount on the AirPods 2 in these deals.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-2-and-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Red-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895354" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C are available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. This is a match of the record low price on these AirPods, which feature a new USB-C port as well as improved dust resistance and 20-bit 48kHz lossless audio when paired with the Apple Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>

This is another match of an all-time low price, and for the AirPods 3 this is the first time in 2024 that we're tracking a best-ever price on the model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;29 OFF</div>AirPods 3 for &#36;139.99</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The well-known repair website iFixit today shared a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/90137/vision-pro-teardown-why-those-fake-eyes-look-so-weird">written teardown</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVJPAYwY8Us">video teardown of the Apple Vision Pro</a>, offering a look inside the mixed reality headset.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVJPAYwY8Us?si=rslK4MNOQW_qMDrZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
iFixit's disassembly of the Vision Pro reveals several internal components, including an array of cameras and sensors, fans, lens motors, and more. Unsurprisingly, it appears that opening and repairing the headset will be difficult.<br/>
<br/>
"The EyeSight seems like a repair Achilles' heel—so many points of failure for a slightly creepy feature," said iFixit, in an email. "But we'll give Apple credit where it's due: the easily replaceable speakers and battery are big repairability wins."<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro is powered by an M2 chip with an 8-core CPU, a 10-core GPU, a 16-core Neural Engine, and 16GB of unified memory. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-tech-specs/">Other specs include</a> up to 1TB of storage, and an all-new R1 chip that "processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user's eyes."<br/>
<br/>
The publication <em>Wallpaper*</em> <a href="https://www.wallpaper.com/tech/apple-vision-pro-review">had already shared</a> an image of the Vision Pro's internals on Friday, as part of an exclusive Vision Pro design interview with Apple's vice president of software design Alan Dye and vice president of hardware design Richard Howarth.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Internals-1.jpg" alt="" width="1360" height="784" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934630" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image Credit: Wallpaper*</em></div><br/>
Howarth said Apple designed the Vision Pro with "a lot of flexible materials and soft textures" like the Solo Knit Band so that people "would not only feel physically comfortable wearing it, but also enjoy wearing it around others too."<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro launched on Friday in the U.S., and Apple said the headset will be available in additional countries later this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/">Teardown</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/ifixit-apple-vision-pro-teardown/">iFixit Shares Apple Vision Pro Teardown</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-shares-apple-vision-pro-teardown.2418368/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the launch of the Vision Pro, Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214051#416">shared additional details</a> about the headset's Optic ID iris authentication option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-eye-tracking.jpg" alt="" width="2080" height="1170" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898908" /><br/>
Optic ID can recognize the uniqueness of your irises, the colored part of your eyes, allowing you to quickly unlock your Vision Pro, authorize Apple Pay purchases, sign in to many third-party apps, access sensitive personal data, and more. Apps that support Face ID and Touch ID on the iPhone and iPad automatically support Optic ID. After setting up Optic ID, it also becomes a requirement in order use your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-persona-tips/">Persona</a>.<br/>
<br/>
"In the same way that Touch ID revolutionized authentication using a fingerprint and Face ID revolutionized authentication using facial recognition, Optic ID revolutionizes authentication using iris recognition," says Apple. "Optic ID provides intuitive and secure authentication that uses the uniqueness of your iris, made possible by Apple Vision Pro's high-performance eye-tracking system of LEDs and infrared cameras."<br/>
<br/>
Optic ID scans both of your eyes by default. Given that the size of your irises and pupils change in various lighting conditions, Apple says Optic ID adapts by updating your enrolled template after each successful authentication. Apple ensures that <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/optic-id#416">all biometric data is encrypted</a> and never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
There is an accessibility option for using Optic ID with one eye only that can be turned on in the Settings app under Accessibility → Eye Input. Optic ID can also be kept off entirely, in which case you authenticate with a passcode only.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Optic-ID.jpg" alt="" width="1178" height="663" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934569" /><br/>
For users who require vision correction, Optic ID works with the Vision Pro's ZEISS optical inserts and prescription soft contact lenses.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says Optic ID uses "advanced hardware and software" for iris recognition.<br/>
<br/>
"When you set up Optic ID, spatiotemporally modulated eye-safe near-infrared light illuminates the eye, so that the Apple Vision Pro eye cameras can capture images of your iris," says Apple. "This iris image data is sent to and processed on the Secure Enclave and a portion of the Apple M2 chip's neural engine that's protected within the Secure Enclave, where it is transformed into a mathematical representation for enrollment. When you authenticate with Optic ID, the authentication attempt uses the same process to compare your iris to the enrolled biometric data to determine whether there is a match."<br/>
<br/>
Optic ID complies with international safety standards and "won't cause harm to the eyes or skin due to the low output of the emitters," according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that a probability that a random person could unlock your Vision Pro using Optic ID is less than one in a million, similar to Face ID. The company explains that Optic ID matches against "detailed iris structure in the near-infrared domain," which "reveals highly unique patterns independent of iris pigmentation."<br/>
<br/>
Optic ID allows a maximum of five unsuccessful match attempts before a passcode is required. As an additional layer of protection, you can set the Vision Pro to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/apple-vision-pro/tanf79745605/visionos#416">erase all information, media, and personal settings</a> after 10 consecutive failed passcode attempts.<br/>
<br/>
You also need to enter your passcode when:<ul><li>The device has just been turned on or restarted.</li><br/>
<li>The device hasn't been unlocked for more than 48 hours.</li><br/>
<li>The passcode hasn't been used to unlock the device in the last six-and-a-half days and Optic ID hasn't unlocked the device in the last 4 hours.</li></ul>You may still be able to use Optic ID in these cases if your iPhone is nearby, as Apple explains in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213962#416">support document about setting up and using Optic ID</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/optic-id/">Optic ID</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/apple-vision-pro-optic-id/">Optic ID: Apple Explains Vision Pro&#039;s Iris Authentication System</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/optic-id-apple-explains-vision-pros-iris-authentication-system.2418352/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new Vision Pro headset can serve as an external display for a Mac, allowing you to view and control your computer in a visionOS window. The feature is even compatible with some older Intel-based Macs, with one limitation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Mac-Virtual-Display.jpg" alt="" width="1178" height="663" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934472" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213971#416">new support document</a>, Apple has confirmed that the Vision Pro's Mac Virtual Display feature is compatible with any Mac running macOS Sonoma. If the Mac has an Apple silicon chip, the headset can show its display at up to 4K resolution. If the Mac has an Intel processor, however, Apple says resolution is limited to up to 3K.<br/>
<br/>
macOS Sonoma is compatible with the following Macs:<ul><li><strong>MacBook Pro:</strong> 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>MacBook Air:</strong> 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac mini:</strong> 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>iMac:</strong> 2019 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>iMac Pro:</strong> 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac Studio:</strong> 2022 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac Pro:</strong> 2019 and later</li></ul>To use the feature, the Vision Pro and the Mac need to be signed in to the same Apple ID, and the account must have two-factor authentication turned on. In addition, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth must be enabled on both devices to establish a connection.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at a MacBook while wearing the Vision Pro, a "Connect" button will appear above it. For desktop Macs, or if the button fails to appear, Mac Virtual Display can also be turned on in the Vision Pro's Control Center.<br/>
<br/>
You can move your Mac's virtual display by pinching and dragging the window's bottom bar, and bring it closer or farther away. You can also resize the window by pinching and dragging the window bars that appear in the bottom corners.<br/>
<br/>
If your Mac has multiple external displays connected to it, the Vision Pro only shows the one set as the main display in the Mac's System Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
You can use your Mac's built-in keyboard and trackpad, or a paired Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad, to control both the Mac Virtual Display and other visionOS apps. However, the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-bluetooth-accessories/">cannot be used with a Bluetooth mouse</a>, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's instructions for turning on Universal Control:<blockquote>If you want to share the pointer between your macOS and visionOS apps, Handoff must be turned on on both devices. On Apple Vision Pro, go to Settings  > General > Handoff. On your Mac, go to System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff.<br/>
<br/>
On your Mac, you also need to turn on "Allow your pointer and keyboard to move between any nearby Mac or iPad."

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 17.4, currently in beta, Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">allowing alternative app marketplaces on the iPhone in the EU</a>. Apple made this change to comply with new regulations under the EU's Digital Markets Act, which takes full effect next month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/app-store-awards-2022.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876046" /><br/>
In an <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91021439/apple-phil-schiller-iphone-app-store-alternative-eu-risk-security">interview with <em>Fast Company</em></a>'s Michael Grothaus published today, Apple's former marketing chief and current App Store head Phil Schiller said there are privacy and security risks associated with these alternative app marketplaces:<blockquote>"These new regulations, while they bring new options for developers, also bring new risks. There's no getting around that. So we're doing everything we can to minimize those risks for everyone," Schiller told me in a recent discussion about the privacy and security impact of the European Commission's Digital Markets Act.</blockquote>One of these risks is the potential for users to download malicious or unsafe apps, although Apple will be notarizing all apps through a combination of automated processes and a basic human review in order to prevent these apps from being available on alternative app marketplaces as much as possible. Still, Apple has said notarization will not be as thorough as its App Store review process and guidelines that developers must adhere to.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-app-store-notarization-eu.jpg" alt="" width="2124" height="1195" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932861" /><br/>
Another risk is that the App Store's strict rules surrounding objectionable content might not extend to alternative app marketplaces, according to Schiller:<blockquote>"We have dealt with a lot of input from families, from governments, on things that we need to do to try to either not allow certain kinds of objectionable content on our App Store, or give users control over that experience to decide what’s best for themselves—and we have rules around that," Schiller says. "Those rules will not apply in another marketplace unless they choose to make rules of their own, [with] whatever criteria they come up with. Does that increase the risk of users, and families, running into objectionable content or other experiences? Yes, it does."</blockquote>Schiller's comments reiterate many of the risks that Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#ios-app-eu">outlined on its website</a>:<blockquote>If not properly managed, alternative distribution poses increased privacy, safety, and security risks for users and developers. This includes risks from installing software from unknown developers that are not subject to the Apple Developer Program requirements, installing software that compromises system integrity with malware or other malicious code, the distribution of pirated software, exposure to illicit, objectionable, and harmful content due to lower content and moderation standards, and increased risks of scams, fraud, and abuse. Apple has less ability to address these risks, and to support and refund customers regarding these issues. Even with safeguards, many of these risks remain.</blockquote>The full interview can be read on <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91021439/apple-phil-schiller-iphone-app-store-alternative-eu-risk-security"><em>Fast Company</em>'s website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/">Phil Schiller</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/phil-schiller-on-risks-of-iphone-app-marketplaces/">Apple&#039;s Phil Schiller Discusses Risks of Alternative App Stores on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-phil-schiller-discusses-risks-of-alternative-app-stores-on-iphone.2418312/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Vision Pro is here! Apple's "spatial computing" headset has officially launched, and we've got all the details on the ground-breaking new device for both early adopters and those just looking for more information as Apple takes in first step into what it believes is the future of computing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/top-stories-3feb2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934335" /><br/>
While the Apple Vision Pro launch was the biggest news of the week, it certainly wasn't the only topic making waves as Apple is continuing work on iOS 17.4 with a host of changes to how the app ecosystem will work in the European Union, we received word that iOS 18 coming later this year could be a massive update, and more, so read on below for more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Vision Pro Launches: 'The Era of Spatial Computing Has Arrived'</h2><br/>
After years of rumors, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-launch-day/">the Apple Vision Pro has finally launched</a>, at least in the United States. In-store launches began at 8:00 a.m. Friday, with pre-order deliveries also happening the same day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Fifth-Avenue-Vision-Pro-Launch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934152" /><br/>
Apple has shared a wealth of information alongside the launch, and we've rounded up quite a bit including an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-app-list/">extensive list of some of the 600 native apps</a> available for visionOS at launch, details on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-vision-pro-guest-mode/">how to let a guest try out your Vision Pro</a>, tips for making the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-persona-tips/">best possible virtual Persona</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-bluetooth-accessories/">accessories you can use with your Vision Pro</a>, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Hands-On With the Apple Vision Pro: Unboxing, Initial Thoughts and More</h2><br/>
We've picked up our own Vision Pro unit and put together a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/vision-pro-unboxing/">lengthy video outlining the unboxing, setup, and early impressions</a> of the lead device in Apple's latest product category.<br/>

There are certainly some mind-blowing aspects to the aspect, but there are other areas where the experience isn't ideal, so be sure to check out our initial coverage and stay tuned for more in-depth reports as we spend additional time with it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Seeds First iOS 17.4 Public Beta With EU App Ecosystem Changes and More</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-releases-ios-17-4-public-beta/">seeded the first public beta of iOS 17.4</a> with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">long list of changes to the App Store, Safari, Wallet, and more in the EU</a>. These changes are the result of Apple complying with new regulations set to be enforced next month under the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
iOS 17.4 will be released to all users in March, and the changes only apply to EU countries. We recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">recapped all of the changes</a> in one convenient list.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 Potentially 'Biggest' Software Update in iPhone's History</h2><br/>
iOS 18 has the potential to be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/">"biggest" software update in the iPhone's history</a>, according to info shared by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" /><br/>
Gurman said he plans to share more details about specific iOS 18 features and changes that are planned in the future, but we already know about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/02/ios-18-features/">two new features that should be included in the update</a>, including RCS support in the Messages app and ChatGPT-like generative AI functionality for Siri.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation Apple CarPlay Will Feature These 8 New Apps</h2><br/>
Apple recently updated its website to confirm that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/next-generation-carplay-apps/">first U.S. vehicle models with next-generation CarPlay support will debut in 2024</a>, but it did not provide a more specific timeframe, or indicate when availability will begin in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927534" /><br/>
The first beta of iOS 17.4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/next-generation-carplay-apps/">references eight new CarPlay apps</a>, including Auto Settings, Car Camera, Charge, Climate, Closures, Media, Tire Pressure, and Trips.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and Spotify overwhelmingly dominate the music streaming space, but the two services offer surprisingly different experiences despite their competitive pricing, so which is best?<br/>

While Spotify has been around for longer than &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, both services are now very widely adopted. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and Spotify have similar libraries with over 100 million songs, with features like personalized playlists, live lyrics, collaboration, crossfade, and SharePlay support, making it all the more difficult to choose between them.

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Both &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and Spotify boast extensive music libraries, sophisticated personalization features, and comparable subscription models, but the nuances of their offerings cater to slightly different audiences. When choosing between the services, you should decide which of the two following groups you fall into.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; touts a seamless and feature-rich listening experience for Apple device users, offering particular advantages to those who are heavily embedded in Apple's ecosystem. The service is particularly appealing to audiophiles and those invested in high-quality audio, thanks to features like Lossless Audio and Spatial Audio. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s exclusive content, such as live radio shows and the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Classical app, provides unique value to those seeking more than just a vast music library. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; is the preferred choice for users who appreciate the convenience of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; integration, conventional library management, the ability to merge their own music library with the streaming service, and who are possibly already subscribed to other Apple services, making the &zwnj;Apple One&zwnj; bundle an attractive proposition.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify, on the other hand, excels in music discovery and social sharing. Its sophisticated algorithms that power features like Discover Weekly and Release Radar are unmatched for surfacing new music tailored to the listener's tastes. Spotify's cross-platform design and compatibility with a wide range of devices make it a versatile option for users with a diverse range of hardware. The service's superior social features, such as the ability to see what friends are listening to in real-time, enrich the music discovery process. Spotify is the go-to choice for users who value these social and discovery aspects highly, as well as those who appreciate the option of a free, ad-supported tier.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> supports Bluetooth, Apple said today <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213998">in a support document</a> that there is no guarantee that third-party Bluetooth accessories and devices will be compatible. Apple did, however, provide information on what will work for sure.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/mac-magic-keyboard.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-836750" /><br/>
<h2 id="airpodsbeats">AirPods/Beats</h2><br/>
All current models of AirPods and Beats headphones are able to connect to the Vision Pro. Apple recommends the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 with USB-C Charging Case for the best experience because it supports Lossless Audio and ultra-low latency, while older AirPods models do not.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="keyboards">Keyboards</h2><br/>
Most Bluetooth keyboards made by Apple and other manufacturers will work with the Vision Pro. The Vision Pro is not compatible with older Apple keyboards that use removable batteries.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro has a virtual keyboard that can be used, but for anything beyond entering a password or typing a quick message, users will want a Bluetooth keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="mice_and_trackpads">Mice and Trackpads</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; does not work with Bluetooth mice at all. It does work with the Apple Magic Trackpad, but older Trackpads with removable batteries are not compatible, nor are trackpads from other manufacturers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="controllers">Controllers</h2><br/>
All Made for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Bluetooth controllers can connect to the Vision Pro, including Xbox and PlayStation controllers. Apple says that any controller that works with iPadOS will work with Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Traveling is perhaps one of the best uses of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, as it can be used on airplanes and has a specific Travel Mode. Apple today published several support documents that provide some important details on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214004">traveling with the Vision Pro</a>, activating the built-in Travel Mode, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214004">storing it</a> when it's not in use.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="how_to_travel_with_vision_pro">How to Travel With Vision Pro</h2><br/>
The cover that comes with the Vision Pro should be placed on it to protect the glass before it is packed up, but Apple says users should also make sure there are no loose objects like keys or coins nearby that could scratch the internal displays.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recommends the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; Travel Case, which is &#36;200, a soft padded bag, or a "similar protective solution" to protect the Vision Pro from impacts and "excessive vibration." Apple's Travel Case is rather large, so it might be difficult to bring as a carry-on because of the space that it takes up.<br/>
<br/>
If the Vision Pro won't be used for an extended period, it should be disconnected from the battery, and Apple says that the ZEISS Optical Inserts should be packed separately so they don't accidentally detach.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="how_to_use_vision_pro_in_travel_mode">How to Use Vision Pro in Travel Mode</h2><br/>
Travel Mode is specifically designed for using the Vision Pro while on a flight. It can be activated from the Control Center by following these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Look up and then tap on the arrow near the top of the display to open Control Center.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on the Control Center button to see more options.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on the Travel Mode button.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap Turn on Travel Mode to confirm.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Exiting Travel Mode can be done by going back to Control Center and tapping "Turn Off."<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the Vision Pro cannot be set up on an airplane, and also Personas are not available when Travel Mode is turned on.<br/>
<h2 id="travel_mode_tips">Travel Mode Tips</h2><br/>
Apple says that users should follow these guidelines when using Travel Mode:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Remain seated while Travel Mode is on, and remove the Vision Pro before standing up. Features that help you stay aware of your surroundings are disabled when Travel Mode is activated.</li><br/>
 <li>Take off the Vision Pro during taxiing, takeoff, and landing. Also remove it if there is turbulence on the flight.</li><br/>
 <li>Avoid looking out the airplane's windows, because it can impact the Vision Pro's ability to detect your surroundings.</li><br/>
 <li>If content appears tilted or off-center, long-press on the Digital Crown to re-center the view.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="storing_vision_pro">Storing Vision Pro</h2><br/>
If the Vision Pro is not going to be in use for a while, Apple recommends taking these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Attach the cover to the Vision Pro to prevent dust accumulation or damage, but make sure the cover is clean and free of debris first.</li><br/>
 <li>Disconnect the battery.</li><br/>
 <li>Place the Vision Pro on a stable, flat surface with the cover glass facing forward. Do not put the Vision Pro facing downward. Alternatively, place it in the Vision Pro Travel Case.</li><br/>
 <li>The Vision Pro can withstand temperatures ranging from -4º to 113º F. It should not be stored in areas that exceed this range.</li><br/>
 <li>Do not leave the Vision Pro in a car because temperatures in parked cars can get too warm.</li><br/>
 <li>Do not leave the Vision Pro in direct sunlight for any length of time.</li><br/>
 <li>Make sure the relative humidity of where the Vision Pro is stored is between 0 percent and 95 percent.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
In day to day usage, Apple also suggests that users put the cover back on the Vision Pro whenever it's not being worn. Apple also warns against placing the Vision Pro with the glass facing downward, and says to put it on the polishing cloth rather than any rough or abrasive surface.<br/>
<br/>
Picking up the Vision Pro should always be done with two hands, and it should never be picked up by the Light Seal or Audio Straps.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-travel/">What You Need to Know About Traveling With Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-you-need-to-know-about-traveling-with-apple-vision-pro.2418238/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
