		<description><![CDATA[Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers are able to individually repair the bottom-right microphone on the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> today from multiple sources.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
The new procedure of replacing this microphone on its own should make these repairs cheaper for customers, and also less wasteful, as part of Apple's focus on environmental responsibility. As for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and other iPhone models, repairing this microphone still requires replacing the entire mid-frame chassis. <br/>
<br/>
For repairs of all other microphones on iPhones, including next to the earpiece and rear camera, a mid-frame replacement is still required.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aasp/">Apple Authorized Service Providers</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/apple-can-repair-iphone-15-bottom-microphone/">Apple Can Now Repair Bottom Microphone on iPhone 15 and 15 Plus</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-can-now-repair-bottom-microphone-on-iphone-15-and-15-plus.2403993/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular new roleplaying game Baldur's Gate 3 is available to play on the Mac starting today. The title can be downloaded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">through the Steam platform</a> and it is playable on Apple silicon Macs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Baldur's Gate 3: Launch Trailer" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuCfkgaaa08" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The game's minimum requirements include the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> processor and 8GB RAM, but the recommended requirements suggest an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> or better Apple silicon chip and at least 16GB RAM. With the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip, the game can be run on low to medium settings, but the recommended requirements support high or ultra settings.<br/>
<br/>
Baldur's Gate 3 was initially released on Windows in August, and it is the third game in the Baldur's Gate series. Players can choose one of six pre-made characters or create a custom character to play. The game is set in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, and it uses turn-based combat.<br/>
<br/>
There are 12 classes and 11 races to choose from, along with options to play solo or online with up to four people.<br/>
<blockquote>Gather your party and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power. Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a mind flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.</blockquote><br/>
Baldur's Gate 3 has received almost universally positive reviews, and it is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">available from Steam</a> for &#36;60.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/baldurs-gate-3-mac/">Baldur&#039;s Gate 3 Now Available on Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3-now-available-on-mac.2403977/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the launch of the iPhone 15 series today, a few readers of our website have reached out to highlight that the devices support USB-C to Ethernet adapters, allowing for a wired internet connection with faster download speeds than Wi-Fi.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Ethernet.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913342" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>iPhone 15 Pro connected to an Ethernet cable via <a href="https://www.prndlcars.com/">former MacRumors editor turned car reviewer Jordan Golson</a></em></div><br/>
Apple confirmed this information in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213839">support document</a> last week, with USB to Ethernet adapters listed as compatible with iPhone 15 models. When an iPhone is connected to an Ethernet cable, an otherwise hidden Ethernet menu appears in the Settings app with IP-related information and various configuration options.<br/>
<br/>
One reader informed us that their iPhone 15 Pro connected to Ethernet achieved a peak download speed of over 800 Mbps in a speed test.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Ethernet-Setting.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913346" /><br/>
While this is one of the various clever ways that the USB-C port on the iPhone 15 models can be used, it should be known that previous iPhones with the Lightning connector also supported Ethernet with an adapter. Nevertheless, we have decided to highlight this information as a helpful tip since it is getting attention.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models launched today in the U.S. and more than 40 other countries.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/iphone-15-usb-c-to-ethernet/">iPhone 15 Models Support USB-C to Ethernet for Faster Internet Speeds</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-models-support-usb-c-to-ethernet-for-faster-internet-speeds.2403975/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iFixit Gets Closer Look at Apple&#039;s Maligned FineWoven iPhone 15 Case With Teardown</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and 15 Pro, Apple introduced a new case material called "FineWoven" as an alternative to leather, and unfortunately, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">it has not proven popular</a> with some customers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ifixit-finewoven-case.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913311" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Image of FineWoven case under microscope from iFixit</div></em><br/>
Given the criticism of the FineWoven case, teardown site <em>iFixit</em> obtained one of the accessories and decided <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/82789/unweaving-the-mystery-apples-finewoven-case-under-the-microscope">to take it apart</a> to get a closer look.<br/>
<br/>
Using a digital microscope, iFixit viewed the FineWoven fabric at 52x and 490x magnification, confirming that it is indeed made up of bundles of tightly woven fibers. Each fiber is much smaller than a strand of hair, measuring in at about six microns thick.<br/>
<br/>
Groups of the individual fibers make up threads that are around 150 microns thick, and iFixit says the microtwill material that Apple is using is not too far off from high-end jackets from companies like Patagonia and Arc'teryx.<br/>
<br/>
When the FineWoven fabric is scratched, the fibers don't break, but the scratch does cause the affected fibers to reflect light irregularly, which means there's a visual mark. The softness of the material also means that items in the pocket with the case can leave an indentation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-finewoven-cases.jpg" alt="" width="2839" height="1177" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910359" /><br/>
Because the FineWoven case is made from fabric, it did stain when exposed to hot sauce and oil, though it was able to resist coffee. When exposed to certain foods or liquids, FineWoven case owners can expect to see the case become stained, and iFixit wasn't able to get the oil or the hot sauce stain out.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit cut the case open to see how it was assembled. The FineWoven fabric is on the outside, with a gray foam inside. Beyond the gray foam, there's a rigid plastic sheet, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> hardware, white foam, another rigid plastic sheet, and an inner layer of FineWoven fabric. All of the layers are thin, and the FineWoven fabric itself is about 0.17mm.<br/>
<br/>
The sides of the case feature the same FineWoven fabric that appears to have been coated in a resin-like material, producing a hard, non-porous surface.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit suggests that those with FineWoven cases protect it with a Durable Water Repellent spray to make the case more resistant to staining and liquid.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/finewoven/">FineWoven</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/ifixit-finewoven-case-teardown/">iFixit Gets Closer Look at Apple&#039;s Maligned FineWoven iPhone 15 Case With Teardown</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-gets-closer-look-at-apples-maligned-finewoven-iphone-15-case-with-teardown.2403945/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Our videographer Dan Barbera just got his new iPhones in, and over on YouTube, he's unboxed the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByhrcCcrng4" title="iPhone 15 &amp; iPhone 15 Pro: Unboxing &amp; Hands-On!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The blue and gray titanium models look fantastic with the new brushed finish, and to go along with them, Dan got the black &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. That model also has a sleek new look thanks to the frosted glass back.<br/>
<br/>
The more contoured corners of the new devices make them more comfortable to hold, and the weight reduction for the 15 Pro models is definitely noticeable. As for the display, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; display is brighter than before in the sun, and for the 15 Pro and Pro Max, that slimmed down bezel looks great.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to watch Dan's video to get a first look at all of the new iPhones, and stay tuned because we'll have device comparisons, deep dives into the camera, and more content coming over the next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/iphone-15-unboxing/">Video: iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Unboxing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/video-iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-unboxing.2403904/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3R79ycZ8xc?si=-aoz69Jj9C2ha3x4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Apple's FineWoven material replaces leather across <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> cases, AirTag accessories, and Apple Watch bands. Many early reviews of the FineWoven items <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">have been negative</a>, criticizing the material's feel, quality, and durability, so we talk over our early thoughts on the new accessories. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> introduce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro/">over 30 new capabilities and improvements</a>, including USB-C and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> across the lineup, as well as a new titanium design and Action button on the high-end models. We dive into some of our favorite standout features and weigh up who should consider upgrading to the latest devices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you skipping the iPhone 15 Pro and waiting another year to upgrade? If so, we already have some iPhone 16 Pro rumors for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-With-Dynamic-Island.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912423" /><br/>
Below, we recap new features rumored for the iPhone 16 Pro models so far:<ul><li><strong>Larger displays:</strong> The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be equipped with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, respectively, according to Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants. The devices are expected to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-taller-aspect-ratio/">taller aspect ratios</a> as part of this change. By comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max have 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively.</li><br/>
<li><strong>48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens:</strong> The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">upgraded 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera lens</a> for higher-resolution photos with more detail when shooting in 0.5× mode, according to Jeff Pu, a tech analyst at Hong Kong investment firm Haitong International Securities.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi 7 support:</strong> The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">support Wi-Fi 7</a>, according to Pu. This would enable the devices to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 is expected to offer peak data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E.</li><br/>
<li><strong>5x optical zoom on Pro model:</strong> The iPhone 15 Pro Max's tetraprism lens system with 5x optical zoom will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">expand to both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.</li></ul>iPhone 16 Pro models should launch in September 2024, so there is still plenty of time to go, and additional details will surface over the coming months.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Today is the launch day of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, and we're already tracking the first discounts on both wearables. Available at Amazon, you can get &#36;9 off the Apple Watch Series 9 and &#36;19 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with no coupon code required.<br/>
<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Although not particularly steep discounts, given that it's launch day these are pretty solid deals for anyone who planned on picking up one of the new Apple Watch models today. If you want a bigger markdown, and are okay with buying a previous generation device, Amazon has the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/deals-apple-watch-ultra-698/">original Apple Watch Ultra at &#36;99 off</a> in select colors right now.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F47259FD7-DAA2-4BD0-8CDF-BB87B8981EB6%3Fingress%3D2%26visitId%3D57642ce4-d45d-4563-8ecf-e3fa49fa6837%26ref_%3Dast_bln"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO &#36;19 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 Launch Day Deals</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
A few of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 models are temporarily out of stock right now, but Amazon notes that you can place your order at the discounted price and they will email you when they have an estimated delivery date. Otherwise, most models of both the Ultra 2 and Series 9 will deliver between September 24 and September 27.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> is available in a range of color options and finishes, with an entirely new hue available alongside some popular classics.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; is available in a total of nine colors, one of which is a brand new shade, and two distinct finishes. With an aluminum casing, the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;'s five available color options are:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Pink</li><br/>
<li>Starlight</li><br/>
<li>Silver</li><br/>
<li>Midnight</li><br/>
<li>(PRODUCT)RED</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Starlight, Silver, Midnight, and (PRODUCT)RED were all available on last year's Series 8 models. The only difference with this year's aluminum models is a new soft pink color.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-series-9-aluminum-color-options.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913143" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple's Silver anodized aluminum finish has been available on the company's devices for well over a decade, while Starlight is a warmer shade of silver that subtly angles toward gold or champagne. Midnight is effectively black with a hint of dark blue or navy. Each of the color options has a matching Apple Watch band, except for silver, since it is easily matched with so many other Apple Watch bands.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; is also available with a polished stainless steel casing in four different color options:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Silver</li><br/>
<li>Gold</li><br/>
<li>Graphite</li><br/>
<li>Space Black (Apple Watch Hermès only) </li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
This selection of stainless steel finishes is identical to the previous generation's offerings. While stainless steel is heavier than aluminum, it is much harder and more durable. It may be more liable to scratch due to its polished finish, but they can be buffed out like a conventional watch or an item of jewelry.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/09/apple-watch-series-7-stainless-steel-colors.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-816234" /><br/>
The stainless steel Apple Watch offers a more high-end, fashion-forward aesthetic, especially when paired with a premium band like the Modern Buckle. The Apple Watch Hermès takes the stainless steel Apple Watch to the next level with exclusive watch faces and ultra-premium bands.<br/>
<br/>
The aluminum &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; starts at &#36;399, while the stainless steel model costs &#36;699. The only difference between the casings other than their material and weight is the front crystal, which is upgraded from Ion-X strengthened glass to sapphire crystal on the stainless steel model.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="how_to_decide_on_an_apple_watch_color">How to Decide on an Apple Watch Color</h3><br/>
It is important to consider which band you plan to use with your Apple Watch to ensure that they complement each other. You may prefer more neutral tones such as Midnight or Silver, and then use a more colorful band. Alternatively, you could choose a more striking device color like Pink, and then use a more neutral band. This is also a key consideration if you plan to switch bands regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Silver on both the aluminum and stainless steel models may age better over time as new devices are released since they are more neutral, monochrome shades, and have been offered across multiple Apple Watch generations.<br/>
<br/>
Pink could be a good choice, especially when combined with the Pink Sport Band, for a bold look, especially if you also have a Pink <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> or &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. If you want an Apple Watch in a brand new shade, Pink is also the only option. It is the color that is most noticeably new and indicates that you have the latest-generation device.<br/>
<br/>
Your choice of color may also be dependent on how often you upgrade your ‌Apple Watch. If you upgrade every year or two, you may be more confident in buying a more striking new color. If you upgrade more often, it can be a good idea to get a different color every time since a new color can certainly add some novelty to purchasing a new ‌Apple Watch and make it feel more different from your previous device. Alternatively, if you plan to keep your ‌Apple Watch for many years and upgrade less often, it may be wiser to consider a neutral color or one that is more similar to one you have enjoyed previously.<br/>
<br/>
Customers with multiple Apple devices may also want to get an Apple Watch color that complements their other devices. For example, if you have a Midnight <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, it will be best complemented by the Midnight &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;. If you already have a Gold <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, it will likely be best accompanied by a Gold stainless steel &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;. Likewise, if you have a Starlight Apple Watch, it will obviously match the Starlight &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9-colors-and-finishes/">Apple Watch Series 9 Colors and Finishes: Which Should You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-colors-and-finishes-which-should-you-choose.2403871/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs6nA1egGWg">video interview with Brian Tong</a>, Apple's VP of Sensing and Connectivity Ron Huang explained why only the updated second-generation AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/apple-vision-pro-lossless-new-airpods-pro-2-only/">support lossless audio with Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Vision-Pro-Person.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913199" /><br/>
Huang revealed that the H2 chip in the USB-C AirPods Pro supports the 5GHz band of wireless frequencies for ultra-low latency and less interference, while the H2 chip in the original second-generation AirPods Pro with a Lightning case is limited to the 2.4GHz band. Apple says it is this 5GHz support that enables the updated AirPods Pro to support lossless audio with the Vision Pro, which is slated for release in the U.S. in early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The topic is briefly discussed at around the 26-minute mark of the video, as highlighted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/22/airpods-pro-2-apple-vision-pro-lossless-explanation/"><em>9to5Mac</em>'s Zac Hall</a> earlier today:<br/>

The updated second-generation AirPods Pro began arriving to customers and launched in stores today.

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon has all-time low prices on Apple's new 15.3-inch MacBook Air notebooks, with the highlight of the sale being a new &#36;250 discount on the 512GB model. You can get the 512GB 15.3-inch MacBook Air for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C76D4RWJ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,249.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,499.00.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This sale is available in all four colors: Space Gray, Midnight, Starlight, and Silver. All models are in stock and have an estimated delivery date between September 24 and September 28. These notebooks debuted in June and this is a new all-time low price on the 512GB model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75NTC96%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;250 OFF</div>15-inch MacBook Air (512GB) for &#36;1,249.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Amazon has the 256GB 15.3-inch MacBook Air on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75NSLJY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,049.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,299.00. This one is available in two colors (Midnight and Starlight), and has an estimated delivery date between September 24 and September 28 as well. At &#36;250 off, it's another all-time low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75NSLJY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;250 OFF</div>15-inch MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;1,049.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Air features a large 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, M2 processor, six-speaker system, two Thunderbolt ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and MagSafe. The 15.3-inch MacBook Air is mostly similar to the 2022 13.6-inch MacBook Air, but there are some key differences that we highlighted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/13-vs-15-inch-macbook-air/">in our buyer's guide</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[If you are unboxing an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max today, make sure to update the device to iOS 17.0.2 before transferring data to the device from another iPhone, or else you <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213933">might encounter issues</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Update-Your-iPhone-15-to-iOS-17.0.2-Before-Transferring-Data-From-Another-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913145" /><br/>
iOS 17.0.2 is only available for the iPhone 15 lineup. Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213781">says</a> the update fixes an issue that may prevent transferring data directly from another iPhone during the device setup process, so installing it is very important. The update should appear during the setup process, or it can be installed via the Settings app under General → Software Update if you proceeded to set up the device as new and transfer data later.<br/>
<br/>
If you already attempted to transfer data from another iPhone before updating to iOS 17.0.2, and your iPhone 15 is now stuck showing an Apple logo, Apple has shared a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213933">support document</a> with steps on how to restore the iPhone:<blockquote>1. Connect your new iPhone to a computer with a cable.<br/>
2. Press and quickly release the volume up button. Press and quickly release the volume down button. Then, press and hold the side button. <br/>
3. Continue to hold while the Apple logo appears and don't let go until an image of a computer and cable appears.<br/>
4. On your computer, locate your new iPhone in the Finder or in iTunes. <br/>
5. Choose Restore when you see the option to Restore or Update.</blockquote>After restoring the iPhone 15 and updating it to iOS 17.0.2, the process of transferring data from another iPhone can be restarted.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy launch day! The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max devices are in the hands of Apple customers as of today. We'll have a full unboxing coming later, but we thought we'd take a quick look at the star of today's launch, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7aoLVRpCjxQ" title="5 Best iPhone 15 Pro Max Features!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Of the four new iPhones that Apple made available today, the 15 Pro Max has the best feature set and it's the device to choose if you want top-of-the-line capabilities. Here's why it stands out:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>USB-C Port</strong> - With USB-C, you can charge your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac with the same USB-C to USB-C cable. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can also be used to charge devices like the AirPods and the Apple Watch, and on the Pro and Pro Max, you can transfer content at up to 10Gb/s with an appropriate cable.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Action Button</strong> - The Action Button replaces the mute switch on the Pro models. It can be set to do all kinds of things like activate a Focus mode, turn on the camera, turn on the Flashlight, activate a Shortcut, and more.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A17 Pro Chip</strong> - The A17 Pro chip enables console gaming on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for the first time with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing. You'll be able to play games like Resident Evil 4 and Death Stranding, and it's going to be just blazing fast for checking email, sending text messages, and scrolling social networks.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Titanium</strong> - The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max have a titanium chassis that's lighter than the stainless steel chassis, so even though these iPhones are the same size as last year's iPhones, they'll feel less weighty in the hand. As a bonus, Apple changed the design to make them more repairable so it's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/iphone-15-pro-cracked-glass-repair-fees-lower/">less expensive</a> if you break the back glass. Other design changes include more contoured edges and slimmer display bezels.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>5x Telephoto Lens</strong> - The 5x telephoto lens is a Pro Max exclusive feature, with the standard 15 Pro limited to 3x optical zoom. 5x optical zoom was made possible with Apple's new tetraprism technology so you can zoom in further than ever before. You'll get 25x zoom in total, and Apple also made a bunch of other improvements to the camera that you can see <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">detailed in our iPhone 15 Pro roundup</a>.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
With all of the features available in the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; plus a larger battery because of more physical space, a larger 6.7-inch display, and the 5x Telephoto lens, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is hard to beat.

For customers who forgot to pre-order one of the new models or simply decided to wait, most configurations ordered online are now estimated for delivery in October, but the good news is that same-day or next-day pickup is now an option at select Apple Store locations around the world.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-explained-how-to-use-new-features/">iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro: How to Use All the New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-how-to-use-all-the-new-features.2403813/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's retail employees are receiving raises between two and five percent this year, which is a smaller pay increase than Apple provided during the pandemic, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-21/apple-stores-give-out-smaller-raises-in-post-pandemic-slowdown">Bloomberg</a></em>. Annual raises are at about four percent on average, with the increases applying to retail employees and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> technical support employees.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/apple-store-palo-alto.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786171" /><br/>
Raises are provided alongside employee reviews, which are done in the fall. Last year, Apple was offering bigger raises of eight to 10 percent to combat labor shortages and employee unionization efforts, but as <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, unionization campaigns have not gained traction and wage growth in the United States is down.<br/>
<br/>
Most of Apple's retail employees in the United States earn now &#36;22 to &#36;30 per hour, and are given restricted stock units valued at up to &#36;2,000 annually. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-retail-employees-2023-raises/">Apple Retail Employees Getting Smaller Raises of Approximately 4% in 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-retail-employees-getting-smaller-raises-of-approximately-4-in-2023.2403745/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207123">support document</a> updated today, Apple indicates that fingerprints might "temporarily alter the color" of the titanium frame on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Fortunately, Apple says this is not a permanent condition, as the fingerprints can be wiped off just like on any other iPhone to restore a clean finish.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Fingerprints.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913020" /><br/>
"For iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, the oil from your skin might temporarily alter the color of the outside band," says Apple. "Wiping your iPhone with a soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth will restore the original look."<br/>
<br/>
Photos of iPhone 15 Pro models with visible fingerprints on the titanium frame have been circulating on social media since the devices were announced last week, but customers should not be concerned about permanent damage. None of this information should be a surprise, but now it is on the record from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
All of the iPhone 15 models launch this Friday, with orders already beginning to arrive to customers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/iphone-15-orders-nz-australia/">in Australia and New Zealand</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-on-iphone-15-pro-fingerprints/">Apple Says Fingerprints Can &#039;Temporarily Alter the Color&#039; of iPhone 15 Pro&#039;s Titanium Frame</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-fingerprints-can-temporarily-alter-the-color-of-iphone-15-pros-titanium-frame.2403741/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is already Friday, September 22 in New Zealand and Australia, which means customers in those countries who pre-ordered an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> with USB-C case are beginning to receive their devices.<br/>
<br/>

Apple fans receiving new &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/16oq5gz/just_received_the_new_iphone_in_new_zealand/">are now sharing</a> photos and first impressions on Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, the <em>MacRumors</em> forums, and other social networks. If you've already received your new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, let us know in the comments below and make sure to share pictures and your first impressions!<br/>
<br/>
There are no Apple retail locations in New Zealand, which means customers in Australia are always the first to be able to pick up new devices or purchase an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>. Available in-store stock in Australia will provide insight into what we can expect in other Apple Stores around the world.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max models sold out during the pre-order period, and orders placed now from Apple's online store will not ship out until late October or even into November for some devices. The standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are not as hard to come by.<br/>
<br/>
If you missed out on pre-orders, purchasing at an &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; or another location like Target, Walmart, or Best Buy is the only way to get a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; on launch day. While retail stores are expected to have stock, popular &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max models could be in short supply and may sell out quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Following New Zealand and Australia, sales and deliveries of the new &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models and the new Apple Watches will begin in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America. Many Apple Stores worldwide will be opening up early at around 8:00 a.m. local time to allow customers to pick up reserved devices and make walk-in purchases.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em>, as we'll have a hands-on and unboxing tomorrow, followed by deep dives into the feature set of the new devices, camera comparisons, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/iphone-15-orders-nz-australia/">First iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Orders Arriving to Customers in Australia and New Zealand</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-orders-arriving-to-customers-in-australia-and-new-zealand.2403731/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
