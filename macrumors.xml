		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> is being credited for saving a family in Colorado, alerting them to a house fire that was accidentally set by the family dog.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-and-Mini-feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-882635" /><br/>
On June 26th, the Colorado Springs Fire Department received a call about a house fire, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/csfdpio/videos/776680021302916/">shared the details</a> and a video on Facebook. The homeowners were alerted to the fire by their &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, which woke them up in the early hours of the morning.<br/>
<br/>
The Colorado Springs Fire Department claims the homeowners received a "high heat" notification from the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, which alerted them to the fire, but the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; doesn't have a feature for sending alerts about high temperatures.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; has Sound Recognition, an option that is able to detect the sound of a fire alarm and send an alert. It's likely that the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; used Sound Recognition to detect the fire, and proceeded to send an alert to the homeowners to let them know what was going on. It is unclear why the family did not hear the fire alarm that the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; must have detected.<br/>
<br/>
Sound Recognition on &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; sends an alert to connected iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches, but does not provide an audio notification. Sound Recognition can be turned on in the Home app by opening up the settings, going to Safety and Security, and toggling on Smoke and CO Alarm under Sound Recognition.<br/>
<br/>
The fire started because the family's dog accidentally turned on the stove. The homeowners had several boxes on the stovetop, and when the dog got up on its hind legs to look at them, the stove knob was turned, activating the burner. The video shows the fire starting shortly after the dog hit the knob.<br/>
<br/>
The homeowners were able to extinguish the fire before the fire department arrived, and there were no injuries aside from treatment for smoke inhalation.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/homepod-fire-alert/">HomePod Saves Family&#039;s Life After Dog Starts Kitchen Fire</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-saves-familys-life-after-dog-starts-kitchen-fire.2430940/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the third betas of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> that Apple released today, there are additional tweaks to a number of features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a> icons, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app, emoji in Messages, and more, with Apple appearing to be preparing for the launch of Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" /><br/>
Apple will continue updating &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;‌ over the course of the next couple of months, refining the beta prior to its launch. We've highlighted everything new in the third ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;‌ beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Dark Mode Icons</h2><br/>
There are now &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; icons for many third-party apps like Facebook, Etsy, Telegram, Signal, Slack, Notion, YouTube, and more. Apple appears to be adding the &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; icons automatically to apps that have icons with a handful colors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-dark-mode-third-party-icons.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957880" /><br/>
With some icons, the secondary color becomes the main color, while the background color is turned to black, and in others, a white icon background transitions to black.<br/>
<br/>
Apps with complicated icon designs in many colors do not change to a &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; color at this time, but Apple does tint them to be darker. When &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; launches, app developers will be able to provide their own dark-tinted icons to be used in lieu of Apple's defaults. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Photos App</h2><br/>
Apple added a Select button for choosing multiple images to the main &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; interface, so there is no longer a need to swipe down to get to the Select button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-photos-select-button.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957881" /><br/>
With this change, the Search button is now just a magnifying glass, but it is highlighted blue to make it stand out more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Emoji</h2><br/>
In Messages, emoji, Memoji, and stickers have all been combined into one interface, which can be navigated using the tiny icons at the bottom of the display. There are icons you can tap into to get to stickers or Memoji, and you can scroll through your Memoji to more quickly find specific characters and poses.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-emoji-stickers-memoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957882" /><br/>
You can create both stickers and Memoji from this interface, and you can use stickers right in your messages like you can use emoji. This works with non-moving stickers only, and those with animation from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-photos/">Live Photos</a> will display in the larger attachment sticker size. The smaller stickers used as emoji are, however, hard to see.<br/>
<br/>
Emoji are displayed larger than before, so you see more detail but fewer characters before having to scroll, and there are more emoji and stickers displayed at once in the Recent section.<br/>
<br/>
Apple likely made these changes to prepare for the debut of Apple Intelligence, Genmoji, and Image Playground.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wallpaper</h2><br/>
There is a dynamic version of the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; wallpaper that transitions through different colors based on the time of day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-dynamic-wallpaper-option.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957883" /><br/>
<h2>Flashlight Interface</h2><br/>
When you activate the Flashlight, or tap on the controls from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, there is a larger and more intuitive interface for changing the brightness and the spread of the LED Flash used for the Flashlight feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-flashlight-refinement.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957884" /><br/>
<h2>Maps</h2><br/>
Apple has once again tweaked the colors of the Maps icon when &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; is activated.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-maps-dark-mode-color.jpg" alt="" width="1588" height="893" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957886" /><br/>
<h2>RCS in Messages</h2><br/>
The interface for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a> in the Messages section of the Settings app has changed. Rather than just showing up as an on/off toggle, it is now a tap-in menu that provides some additional context. Apple explains that sending and receiving messages with &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; uses wireless data, and cellular network identifiers may be shared with carriers and their partners.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-beta-3-messages-rcs-toggle.jpg" alt="" width="2050" height="1153" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957885" /><br/>
Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in Canada and other countries are also now seeing the &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; toggle, though it is unclear if &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; is working outside of the United States. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
There are some mentions of Apple Intelligence features in the code, further hinting at the upcoming addition of AI to the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta. Code references Genmoji, Image Playground, Writing Tools, Image Wand, and more.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing to release a minor iOS 17.5.2 update for the iPhone, according to a post shared today by an anonymous leaker on X, formerly known as Twitter. The leaker has a private account, so we are not identifying it or linking to it, but they have proven to be a consistently accurate source for upcoming iOS updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Orange-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898582" /><br/>
Nothing is known about iOS 17.5.2, beyond the leaker claiming that the update will have a build number of 21F101. However, the update will almost certainly be a minor one, especially given that Apple is now focused on iOS 18 beta testing. iPhone users still running iOS 17 can expect the update to include bug fixes and/or security patches.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear when iOS 17.5.2 will be released to the public, but updates revealed by this leaker typically become available within a few weeks after they post on social media, so it will likely be released at some point in July.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5.2 will come out ahead of iOS 17.6 and iOS 18, which both remain in beta testing. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/apple-seeds-ios-17-6-beta-2-to-developers/">second beta of iOS 17.6</a> was released to developers and public beta testers last week, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-3/">third beta of iOS 18</a> was seeded to developers earlier today. So far, no major changes have been discovered in iOS 17.6.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-preparing-ios-17-5-2/">Apple Preparing Minor iOS 17.5.2 Update for iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-minor-ios-17-5-2-update-for-iphone.2430930/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/everything-new-in-ios-18-beta-2/">release of the second betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;‌ Developer Beta setting. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, a set of AI features that are built deeply into the operating system. Apple Intelligence won't be coming until later in the beta testing process, but it includes features for refining and editing writing, generating images and emoji, and most notably, improving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and search. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is gaining a better understanding of natural language, improved contextual awareness, and the personal assistant will integrate with ChatGPT to answer more complex queries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads with an M-series chip, but there are a number of other features that are coming. Apple is allowing users to rearrange Home screen apps to have open spaces, plus there's a dark mode for app icons and tinting options.<br/>
<br/>
The Control Center is customizable and third-party developers can add controls for their apps, with the Lock Screen Flashlight and Camera icons able to be replaced or removed. Messages is gaining Rich Communication Services support to improve conversations with Android users, the option to schedule texts to be sent later, new text effects, messages over satellite when there's no cellular, and the option to use any emoji for Tapback responses.<br/>
<br/>
There's a dedicated Passwords app for logins, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes, and there's now an option to lock and hide apps, which means they can't be opened without secondary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication even when your phone is unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
Safari has a highlights feature that summarizes articles and surfaces key information on websites, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app interface has been overhauled, and there's a new Tap to Cash feature for privately and securely transferring money using Apple Cash. Other features include equation solving and voice memo transcription in Notes, a game mode for improving game performance, and an option to respond to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on AirPods with head gestures.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is only available to registered developers at the current time, but Apple plans to make a public beta later this month. &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; will see a public launch this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-betas-of-ios-18-and-ipados-18-to-developers.2430918/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the third beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> update to developers, with the third beta coming two weeks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-2-to-developers/">after the second beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; is able to take the depth information from 2D photos and turn them into 3D photos using advanced machine learning. Apple says that the feature is meant to add depth to photos to make memories more immersive.<br/>
<br/>
There are new hand gestures for activating the Home View and Control Center, and the Home View is also now customizable with apps able to be rearranged. Travel Mode now includes support for trains, and Guest User profiles are now saved for 30 days so guests don't have to do the setup process every time they try out the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the year, Mac Virtual Display will support higher resolution and larger sized virtual displays, which Apple says will be equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. With an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> update, the Vision Pro can serve as an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; receiver, so content from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac can be shared to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Mindfulness app can track and respond to breathing patterns using the camera for an improved meditation experience, and the Vision Pro supports Bluetooth mice with &zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-3-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Third visionOS 2 Beta to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-visionos-2-beta-to-developers.2430921/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the ‌&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; introduces a new Vitals app that aggregates health metrics collected during sleep like heart rate and respiratory rate, providing day-to-day health insights to track whether something has changed. There's also a Training Load feature for monitoring the intensity of workouts and how that impacts the body over time.<br/>
<br/>
The Smart Stack has been updated with new widgets and support for Live Activities and Translate, plus it is better able to suggest widgets based on time and daily routine. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> watch face includes suggestions for the best images to use, and the Check In safety feature now works with Workouts.<br/>
<br/>
Activity Rings can be customized to change the goals for each day, and there is an option to pause for rest days or when ill without losing an activity streak. Double Tap now works for navigating through apps with one hand, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> lets users create their own walking and hiking routes.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-watchos-11-beta-3-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Third Beta of watchOS 11 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-beta-of-watchos-11-to-developers.2430920/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 18 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 18 adds an InSight feature to the TV app, and it is able to provide real-time information about actors, music, and more in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> shows and music. Enhanced Dialogue has been refined with machine learning and computational audio so it is better able to boost vocal clarity over background noise and music, plus it is now available on built-in TV speakers, AirPods, and other Bluetooth devices.<br/>
<br/>
Subtitles will now show up automatically when relevant, such as when the TV's volume is muted, a show or movie is rewound, or when the language of a show doesn't match the device language.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include 21:9 aspect ratio support for projectors, new screen savers and improved controls for swapping screen savers, and support for Live Captions during <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls through an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-3-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Third Beta of tvOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-beta-of-tvos-18-to-developers.2430919/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today introduced a new all-time low price on Apple's AirPods 3, now available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1WXVQTN%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;129.89</strong></a>, down from &#36;169.00. This is the model that comes with a Lightning Charging Case, and this sale price beats the previous record low price by about &#36;10.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-3-Discount-Feature-Blue-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895369" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
AirPods 3 feature force sensor controls, Adaptive EQ, spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and a streamlined design compared to the AirPods 2. The third-generation AirPods are a few years old at this point, with an updated model expected in just a few months, which is likely why we're starting to see big price drops online.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1WXVQTN%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;39 OFF</div>AirPods 3 for &#36;129.89</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting today, select Walmart stores in the U.S. and Walmart.com will be <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889">selling the MacBook Air with the M1 chip at a bargain &#36;649 price</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/macbook-air-m1-unboxing-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1616" height="902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770435" /><br/>
Walmart+ members have early access <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889">to the deal</a> as of 12 p.m. Eastern Time today, and it will be available to all Walmart customers starting at 6 p.m. Eastern Time today.<br/>
<br/>
Walmart first began selling the MacBook Air with the M1 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/walmart-selling-macbook-air-with-m1-chip/">for &#36;699 in March</a>, marking the first time the retailer ever sold Macs directly. Now, it is available for an even lower &#36;649 heading into the back-to-school shopping season. It is unclear how long the deal will last.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first released the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020, as one of the first Macs with an Apple silicon chip instead of an Intel processor. The configuration being sold for &#36;649 includes the M1 chip, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM/unified memory, with Gold, Silver, and Space Gray color options available. Walmart's product listing says the MacBook Air is in brand new condition, so this is not a used/refurbished model.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-discontinues-m1-macbook-air/">discontinued the MacBook Air with the M1 chip</a> earlier this year, following the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">new MacBook Air models with the M3 chip</a>. Prior to being discontinued, the model with the M1 chip was being sold for a starting price of &#36;999 brand new.<br/>
<br/>
While this model of the MacBook Air is now over three and a half years old, it is still a very capable machine for many average day-to-day tasks. However, it has an older design and has fewer remaining years of macOS compatibility than the latest MacBook Air models, so those aspects should be factored into your purchasing decision.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple added several new accessibility features, and one feature in particular that is likely to have widespread appeal among car passengers is Vehicle Motion Cues, which aims to prevent motion sickness when looking at an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/vehicle-motion-cues.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950825" /><br/>
According to Apple, research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ or ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌ while riding in a moving vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
Vehicle Motion Cues are designed to avoid this sensory conflict with the use of visual elements on the display that indicate real-time changes in motion. Apple explains: <br/>
<blockquote>With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.</blockquote>As things stand in the latest &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta, the Vehicle Motion Cues switch does not work in Settings ➝ Accessibility ➝ Motion, likely because of a bug that hasn't been fixed yet, but that doesn't mean you can't try it out and see if it works for you. Fortunately, the same option works in Control Center. If you're running the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta, here's how to enable it.<br/>
	<ol><li>Invoke Control Center with a diagonal swipe from the top-right corner of the screen (or with a swipe up from the bottom if your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has a Home button).</li><br/>
	<li>Press and hold on any space in the Control Center to enter the customize mode, then tap <strong>Add a Control</strong> at the bottom.</li><br/>
	<li>Swipe up to the "Vision Accessibility" controls, then choose <strong>Vehicle Motion Cues</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/1vehicle-motion-cues-ios-accessibility.jpg" alt="control center" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957816" /><br/>
	<li>Press and hold a space in the Control Center to exit the customize mode.</li><br/>
	<li>Tap the <strong>Vehicle Motion Cues</strong> button, then choose <strong>On</strong> or <strong>Only in Vehicle</strong>.</li></ol><br/>
If you turned on the feature, you should now see the motion cues – roving little dots – around the edges of your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; screen. If you opted for the automatic activation, wait until you're in a moving vehicle for the cues to appear. <br/>
<br/>

There's no guarantee that it will work, but with a bit of luck, the feature will allow you to look at what's on your device for the duration of your journey without you starting to feel nauseous.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/accessibility/">Accessibility</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/prevent-motion-sickness-vehicle-cues-ios/">iOS 18: Prevent Motion Sickness With Vehicle Motion Cues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-prevent-motion-sickness-with-vehicle-motion-cues.2430903/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the lower-cost Apple Pencil with a USB-C port to its online refurbished store for the first time in select European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917176" /><br/>
The refurbished model is discounted by around 15% in each country. For example, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/FUWA3ZM/A/refurbished-apple-pencil-usb-c">pricing is set at £69 in the UK</a>, down from £79 brand new.<br/>
<br/>
Originally released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/usb-c-apple-pencil-hands-on/">in November 2023</a>, the lower-cost Apple Pencil has a similar design as the Apple Pencil 2 and Apple Pencil Pro, but with a USB-C port hidden under a sliding cap for charging and pairing with a USB-C cable. It attaches magnetically to any iPad with a USB-C port, but it does not support wireless charging or wireless pairing. It also lacks pressure sensitivity and a double-tap gesture for switching between drawing tools.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its refurbished products undergo full functionality testing, and are subject to a thorough cleaning process and inspection. The refurbished Apple Pencils are repackaged in a plainer white box with a refurbished label.<br/>
<br/>
Availability of the refurbished USB-C Apple Pencil will likely extend to the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries within the next few weeks.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil With USB-C Now Available in Apple&#039;s Refurbished Store in These Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-with-usb-c-now-available-in-apples-refurbished-store-in-these-countries.2430896/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/se/retail/valacentrum/">announced</a> that its retail store at the Väla Centrum shopping mall near Helsingborg, Sweden will be permanently closed after July 13. The date was spotted by Michael Steeber, who writes a <a href="https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/p/from-helsingborg-to-solna">weekly newsletter about Apple retail</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Store-Vala-Centrum-Sweden.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957755" /><em>Apple Väla Centrum</em></div><br/>
Apple in January told Swedish publication <em>Feber</em> that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/new-apple-store-opening-in-sweden/">would not be renewing its lease</a> at the mall, but it did not provide a reason for the decision. At the same time, Apple announced that it would be opening a new retail store <a href="https://www.apple.com/se/retail/mallofscandinavia/explore/">at the Mall of Scandinavia</a> near Stockholm this year, but it has yet to reveal a grand opening date for that location.<br/>

All in all, Apple will continue to operate three retail stores in Sweden by the end of 2024. However, customers in the Helsingborg area will now have to make around a one-hour commute to Malmö to visit Apple's nearest store in the country.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-store-in-southern-sweden-closing/">Apple Store in Southern Sweden Permanently Closing Later This Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-in-southern-sweden-permanently-closing-later-this-week.2430891/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently announced that its next quarterly earnings conference call <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">will be held on Thursday, August 1</a> at 2 p.m. Pacific Time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-iPad-Air-and-iPad-Pro-11-inch-and-13-inch-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949648" /><br/>
On the call, which anyone can listen to, Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the company's earnings results for the third quarter of the 2024 fiscal year. During the quarter, spanning March 31 through June 29, Apple released new iPad Pro models with the M4 chip, new iPad Air models with the M2 chip, and the Apple Pencil Pro. Near the end of the quarter, Apple also began accepting orders for the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/vision-pro-launching-in-more-countries/">in eight more countries and regions</a>, including Australia, Canada, the U.K., China, Japan, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has not provided formal guidance since early 2020, but analysts expect the company to report quarterly revenue of &#36;77.2 billion on average, according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis?p=AAPL">Yahoo Finance</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/03/apple-3q-2023-results/">reported &#36;81.8 billion revenue</a> in the year-ago quarter.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/aapl-q3-2024-earnings-report-date/">Apple to Report Earnings Results on August 1 After Releasing New iPads Last Quarter</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-report-earnings-results-on-august-1-after-releasing-new-ipads-last-quarter.2430885/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy today has some of the biggest discounts on the M2 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro that we've tracked in months, starting as low as <a href="https://howl.me/cmCSSBYoIR3"><strong>&#36;699.00</strong></a> for the 128GB Wi-Fi 11-inch tablet. A My Best Buy Plus/Total membership is not required to see these discounts.<br/>
<br/>

Best Buy has every model of the 2022 iPad Pro on sale except the 128GB Wi-Fi model of the 12.9-inch tablet. Otherwise, you'll find every Wi-Fi tablet and every cellular tablet on sale at this time, and at record low prices with up to &#36;550 off the iPad Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/cmCSBs9KNeu"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO &#36;550 OFF</div>M2 iPad Pro at Best Buy</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
With such steep savings, these previous generation iPad Pros are worth looking into purchasing for anyone who wants to prioritize saving money over owning the newest M4 iPad Pro. There are some major differences between the two generations, like the M4's support for Apple Pencil Pro and a new nano-texture display option, so be sure to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-pro-2022-vs-2024/">read about which one works best for you</a> in our Buyer's Guide.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://cmf.tech/en-gb/">CMF</a>, a London-based sub-brand of Nothing, has officially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reUBxOyfsi4">announced</a> the CMF Phone 1, boasting a highly customizable modular design and featuring some decent hardware specs for an Android smartphone that starts at just &#36;199.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/nothing-cmf-phone-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957686" /><br/>
The CMF Phone (1) is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 chipset and features a 6.67-inch FHD, 120Hz AMOLED display. There's a 50MP Sony camera on the back, accompanied by a second depth sensor for portraits, and a 16MP front-facing camera. <br/>
<br/>
A 5,000 mAh battery offers up to two days of power on a single charge, and the base model comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It also supports Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3 and 9-band Dual 5G. As it's a budget device, there are a few tradeoffs – there's no NFC, for example, and the device is only splash-resistant. There's also no wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
Look beyond the specs though, and the Android phone's big selling point is its unique screw-based system of interchangeable backplates and accessories. CMF Phone (1) users can switch out different colored shells (black, orange, blue, and light green, costing &#36;35 each) using a supplied flathead screwdriver and screws, resulting in a completely different look, right down to a color-matched SIM tray. <br/>
<br/>
One of the screw points includes a dial-style pop-out for mounting optional accessories, including a kickstand, a MagSafe-style wallet case, and lanyard, each costing &#36;25. Accompanying the release of the phone are new <a href="https://cmf.tech/en-gb/pages/buds-pro-2">CMF Buds Pro 2 wireless earbuds</a> and a <a href="https://cmf.tech/en-gb/pages/watch-pro-2">CMF Watch Pro 2 smartwatch</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/nothing-cmf-phone.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957687" /><br/>
Nothing's <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/cmf-phone-1">CMF Phone (1)</a> is launching in the UK and the EU this week, with a launch in the US scheduled for later in July under a "Beta Program," so expect high demand and a possible waitlist. The device costs &#36;199 in the US, £209 in the UK, and €239 in the EU.     <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nothing/">Nothing</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/nothing-debuts-cmf-phone-1-modular/">Nothing Debuts CMF Phone 1 With Modular Design Starting at &#36;199</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nothing-debuts-cmf-phone-1-with-modular-design-starting-at-199.2430877/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-se-2022.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866330" /><br/>
Writing in this weekend's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman mentioned Apple's work on an &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; that features a rigid plastic casing in lieu of anodized aluminum. He postulated that this may be one technique Apple may be planning to use to bring the cost of the &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; down. The current &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; sells for &#36;249, but Samsung's cheapest rival watch, the Galaxy Watch FE, sells for &#36;199.<br/>
<br/>
Apple famously released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 5C with an "unapologetically" plastic casing in 2013, which was effectively a rehoused version of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5. The polycarbonate exterior was available in various vibrant color options. The device was somewhat controversial because critics argued that the plastic casing was a step down from the luxurious metal finishes of previous models and some consumers felt that the device's price point was still too high for what was perceived as an inferior product.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/apple-watch-se-with-plastic-casing/">Apple Reportedly Developing Apple Watch SE With Plastic Casing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-developing-apple-watch-se-with-plastic-casing.2430833/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's revamped version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is unlikely to be available with the initial rollout of Apple Intelligence later this year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q">latest "Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman wrote that the full new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; should arrive with iOS 18.4 in the spring of 2025, preceded by a beta testing period that is due to start in January. The more capable version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; allows the voice assistant to control actions within Apps, allowing it to understand what is currently on-screen and determine what to do based on context.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence launches in the fall. While the entire new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will not be available at this time, other &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features, such as a new design and ChatGPT integration, should be present upon the debut of Apple Intelligence this year. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier today, Gurman explained that both the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">feature a new processor</a> that succeeds last year's S9 chip. While this could "lay the groundwork for some AI enhancements down the road," it will not run Apple Intelligence and there are currently said to be no plans to bring "the full initiative" to the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">previously reported</a> that Apple Intelligence will come to the Vision Pro headset next year. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, on the other hand, is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">not slated</a> to get the new suite of features, with the company holding off for a new "AI-powered table-top robot."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/new-siri-experience-to-debut-spring-2025/">New Siri Experience With Apple Intelligence Likely to Debut in Spring 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-siri-experience-with-apple-intelligence-likely-to-debut-in-spring-2025.2430831/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Series 10 will feature a larger display and a new chip, but new health monitoring features for the device are now in question, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/f1662570472.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-861885" /><br/>
In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q">latest edition</a> of his "Power On" newsletter, Gurman said that the design of the Apple Watch Series 10 is "unlikely to look much different" to its predecessor, but it will be thinner. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch Ultra will not get a new design this year.<br/>
<br/>
The new Apple Watch "Series" models will continue to be available in two casing sizes codenamed "N217" and "N218," and feature larger displays. One of the models will have a screen roughly as large as that of the Apple Watch Ultra. <br/>
<br/>
Both the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 will apparently feature a new processor that succeeds last year's S9 chip. While this could "lay the groundwork for some AI enhancements down the road," it will not run Apple Intelligence and there are currently said to be no plans to bring "the full initiative" to the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been developing hypertension and sleep apnea detection features for the Apple Watch that were originally slated for release in 2024, but Gurman now says that the "effort hasn't gone smoothly" and "Apple has run into some serious snags." The hypertension detection feature has been insufficiently reliable during testing and there are concerns about integrating it into the refreshed design, which could force Apple to postpone this feature until next year<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the sleep apnea detection feature is now in trouble because it relies on blood oxygen saturation, which Apple Watches in the United States cannot currently measure due to an ongoing legal dispute with Masimo. Gurman postulates that the despute with Mazimo could be resolved by September, or Apple could find a way around it by arguing that the blood oxygen sensor could be used for purposes that are not directly related to blood oxygen levels. The company could also announce the sleep apnea detection feature and hold off releasing it until a later date. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is also purportedly continuing testing and discussing the prospect of 3D-printed casings for some Apple Watch models, which could accelerate production and use less material.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says it is still not clear whether Apple will brand the new Apple Watches as special anniversary models or wait until next year, given that the original Apple Watch was announced in 2014 and released in 2015.<br/>
