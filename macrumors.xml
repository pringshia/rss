		<description><![CDATA[Taiwanese research firm TrendForce this week <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240722-12228.html">said</a> it anticipates that Apple will begin releasing iPhones with quad-level cell (QLC) storage by 2026. This technology could pave the way for iPhones with 2TB of storage in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature-White.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911430" /><br/>
QLC is a denser storage technology compared to the triple-level cell (TLC) technology used for storage chips in existing iPhones, and this would allow for higher storage capacity within the same physical footprint. In addition, QLC storage is typically less expensive than TLC in terms of price per gigabyte. However, one downside is that QLC storage typically offers slower read and write speeds compared to TLC storage.<br/>
<br/>
The density and cost advantages of QLC could pave the way for Apple to release a 2TB storage capacity for future iPhones. TrendForce's estimate that Apple will adopt the technology by 2026 means that it could be incorporated into iPhones starting with iPhone 16 models, iPhone 17 models, or iPhone 18 models, so there is still no exact timeframe for this change. A report from supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em> earlier this year claimed that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/1tb-iphone-16-pro-could-face-performance-setback/">evaluating QLC for 1TB models</a> of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, so the technology could end up being used for both 1TB and 2TB storage capacities.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 16 series in September, so we are only a few months away from finding out whether a 2TB storage capacity and QLC storage technology are introduced this year or further into the future.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/">TrendForce</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/iphone-qlc-stroage-rumor/">Apple Expected to Adopt Technology That May Pave Way for 2TB iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expected-to-adopt-technology-that-may-pave-way-for-2tb-iphones.2432132/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple stands to benefit significantly from India's recent reduction in import duties on mobile phones and components, aimed at boosting local manufacturing and making high-end smartphones more affordable (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-budget-india-cuts-import-tax-smartphones-boost-apple-2024-07-23/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Apple-BKC-Mumbai-India-media-preview-hero.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-892713" /><br/>
India has announced a 5% cut in import duties on mobile phones, printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs), and mobile device chargers, reducing the rate from 20% to 15%. The move is expected to save Apple &#36;35â€“50 million annually and supports the company's efforts to increase its manufacturing presence in India. Apple's assembly operations in the country, conducted through its partners like Foxconn, have grown significantly in recent years, with 14% of all iPhones now being produced in India. Foxconn has recently invested in new manufacturing plants in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, further boosting production capacity.<br/>
<br/>
The reduction in import duties is part of India's broader strategy to enhance its role in the global supply chain, particularly in the electronics sector. Apple continues to import a significant number of its premium models, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, into India. The reduced import duties will make these high-end models more affordable for Indian consumers. <br/>
<br/>
The country's official economic survey for 2024 also highlights the positive impact of initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and the Districts as Export Hubs (DEH) program. These programs have attracted substantial foreign investment, leading to increased local manufacturing capabilities.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/">Foxconn</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-expansion-in-india-to-accelerate/">Apple&#039;s Expansion in India Set to Accelerate Thanks to Duty Reductions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-expansion-in-india-set-to-accelerate-thanks-to-duty-reductions.2432130/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy today has every model of <a href="https://howl.me/cmJGUyxasoz">Apple's 15-inch M3 MacBook Air</a> on sale for new all-time low prices. These deals are only available to My Best Buy Plus and Total members, and reach &#36;250 off each of these computers. We're also still tracking a massive &#36;180 discount on <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-11911660?url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2Fitem%2FOWC%2FTB3DK14PSG%2F">OWC's 14-Port Thunderbolt 3 Dock today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>15-Inch M3 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m3-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950298" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the 8GB RAM/256GB SSD 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, you can get this model for <a href="https://howl.me/cmJGUyxasoz"><strong>&#36;1,049.00</strong></a> if you're a My Best Buy Plus/Total member, down from &#36;1,299.00. The 8GB RAM/512GB SSD model is available for <a href="https://howl.me/cmJGV1d2vuA"><strong>&#36;1,249.00</strong></a> for members, down from &#36;1,499.00, while the 16GB RAM/512GB model is on sale for <a href="https://howl.me/cmJGW0QIpnc"><strong>&#36;1,449.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,699.00.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: My Best Buy Plus/Total membership required to see deals.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/cmJGUyxasoz"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;250 OFF</div>15-inch M3 MacBook Air (8GB/256GB) for &#36;1,049.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
It's worth noting that even if you have to pay the &#36;49.99/year starting fee to join Best Buy's membership, today's MacBook Air deals are so steep you'll still come out paying around &#36;1,099.99 for the entry-level model, which is a match for the typical best price on the computer. The same goes for the other two models as well.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will feature the ability to create playlist artwork in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> using generative AI, beta code suggests.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Apple is seemingly preparing to introduce a new feature in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; that allows users to create customized playlist artwork in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; using Apple Intelligence. The feature, uncovered in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-4/">iOS 18 beta 4</a> code by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/23/apple-music-playlist-artwork-apple-intelligence/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>, will enable users to generate unique images tailored to their playlists using Image Playground.<br/>
<br/>
At the core of this new functionality is a new "Create Image" button, which users will see while editing their playlists. Once tapped, this button will invoke Image Playground, a tool showcased at WWDC earlier this year. Image Playground enables users to generate new images by inputting written commands. These AI-generated images can vary in appearance, offering animation, illustration, and sketch styles, though it does not support the creation of photorealistic images. Users can specify their preferences for the artwork, and &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; will produce several options that match the playlist's theme or content.<br/>
<br/>
Like other Apple Intelligence features, it is currently unavailable in the beta versions of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. Originally, some Apple Intelligence features were expected to be included in the summer beta releases. However, these references were subsequently removed from Apple's website. According to a recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/new-siri-experience-to-debut-spring-2025/">report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, some of these AI features might launch until 2025. Given that Apple Intelligence has not appeared in beta 4, it seems likely that the full rollout may be postponed until iOS 18.1 or later. &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is slated for release in the fall, with a beta preview already accessible to developers and public beta users.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/9to5mac-com/">9to5Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-intelligence-to-generate-playlist-artwork/">Apple Intelligence to Generate Playlist Artwork in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-to-generate-playlist-artwork-in-ios-18.2432123/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has released a new Environment for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, called Lake Vrangla, which is close to Oslo in Norway.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lake-vrangla-environment-vision-pro-1.jpg" alt="" width="1770" height="994" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959756" /><br/>
&zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;'s passthrough cameras are designed to show the wearer their physical surroundings, allowing them to place apps and other digital objects within the room. However, using the Digital Crown, users can switch to full virtual reality and block out the real world using a selection of Environments.<br/>
<br/>
The new Lake Vrangla Environment is available to all users as a simple download, which can be initiated from the Environments tab of the Home View, regardless of whether users are running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1 or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> beta.<br/>
<br/>
Like Mount Hood, the foggy new environment has a night version that offers a calming sunset scene, and any video viewed over the lake will reflect in the water.<br/>
<br/>
This release follows Apple's announcement that the Bora Bora Environment will be included in &zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; later this year. Its arrival will complete the current Environments menu, making all 13 listed options fulfilled and usable.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-vision-pro-lake-vrangla-environment/">Apple Vision Pro Gains New Lake Vrangla Environment</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-gains-new-lake-vrangla-environment.2432114/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone will adopt a new 1/2.6-inch 48MP Ultra Wide CMOS image sensor (CIS) made by Samsung as early as 2026, breaking Sony's years-long monopoly as Apple's CIS supplier, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/iphone_12_pro_sensor_shift.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1118" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764639" /><br/>
Writing in a brief report <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1816057976358330824">published on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Kuo said Samsung has already established a dedicated team within its ranks to work on the camera components with a view to specifically supplying Apple. <br/>
<br/>
For years now, Apple has exclusively sourced CIS for its iPhones from Sony. However, recent developments suggest a strategic shift away from the Japanese supplier due to concerns about reliability and Apple's need to integrate new technologies into its camera system.<br/>
<br/>
If the 2026 production roadmap goes to plan, Apple could be using Samsung-made image sensors in the camera system that features on its iPhone 18 series.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/2026-iphone-48mp-camera-sensor-samsung/">Kuo: 2026 iPhone to Use New Advanced Camera Sensor From Samsung</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2026-iphone-to-use-new-advanced-camera-sensor-from-samsung.2432111/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adobe today updated its Illustrator and Photoshop Creative Cloud apps, introducing a range of new features that streamline productivity. Many of the additions take advantage of generative AI and machine learning to save creators time.<br/>
<br/>

Photoshop has a <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/07/23/supercharge-core-creative-workflows-adobe-photoshops-latest-update">new Selection Brush Tool</a> for selecting areas by brushing over them without having to use the Quick Mask mode. The tool has opacity and hardness settings for feathered edges, allowing for more seamless selections.<br/>
<br/>
The Adjustment Brush Tool, which has been in beta, is also available. It allows for painting on adjustments to brightness, saturation, and more, with options for fine tuning selections. Photoshop's Generate Image text to image feature is also out of beta, and it can be used to generate dozens of ideas in minutes using a text prompt and/or reference images.<br/>
<br/>

Other new Photoshop features include an improved Contextual Task Bar, support for bulleted and numbered lists, and an Enhance Detail option for Generative Fill.<br/>
<br/>
Adobe Illustrator has a Generative Shape Fill feature for filling shapes with detail and color. Adobe says that users can match the style and color of their own artwork to create multiple editable and scalable vector graphic options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/adobe-illustrator-generative-shape-fill.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959737" /><br/>
Text prompts are used to fill vector graphics for Generative Shape Fill, and there are options to add styles like 3D, geometric, or pixel art.<br/>
<br/>

Adobe improved the Text to Pattern feature in Illustrator, making it simpler to create, edit, and scale seamless vector patterns. Vector graphics that are generated using the feature are crisper, plus there are new UI controls and better editing options.<br/>
<br/>
With Mockup, designers can see their creations on objects like product packaging and apparel, with the tool automatically adjusting art to fit the edges of the object. Other new features in Illustrator include the Dimension tool for precise sizing, enhanced selection capabilities, and faster pan and zoom speeds.<br/>
<br/>
These new features are available in the latest versions of Illustrator and Photoshop on the desktop.

		<description><![CDATA[Shortly after the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max were released last September, some customers began to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">experience an issue with the devices overheating</a>. Apple eventually mitigated the problem <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">with an iOS 17 update</a>, but it might go a step further with the iPhone 16 models that are set to be released later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature-White.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911430" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone"><em>The Information</em> today</a> cited a source who said that iPhone 16 models will be equipped with a "larger graphite sheet" inside the chassis of the devices, to address potential overheating. This corroborates a rumor from last November that claimed iPhone 16 models would feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">improved thermal management system</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release the iPhone 16 series in September, so the devices should be just a few months away from launching. With this rumored change, the post-launch overheating issue should be a thing of the past.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/internal-change-to-iphone-16-models-expected-to-reduce-overheating/">Internal Change to iPhone 16 Models Expected to Reduce Overheating</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/internal-change-to-iphone-16-models-expected-to-reduce-overheating.2432085/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following nearly two years of rumors about a fourth-generation iPhone SE, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone"><em>The Information</em> today reported</a> that Apple suppliers are finally planning to begin ramping up mass production of the device in October of this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iPhone-SE-4-Vertical-Camera-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959379" /><br/>
If accurate, that timeframe would mean that the next iPhone SE would not be announced alongside the iPhone 16 series in September, as expected. Instead, the report speculates that the device could be released ahead of the Lunar New Year in January 2025. However,<br/>
all three existing iPhone SE models were announced in March over the years, so a March 2025 release seems quite possible too.<br/>
<br/>
Rumored features for the fourth-generation iPhone SE include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an Action button, and a USB-C port. The device is expected to be similar to the base iPhone 14, although reports said it would have only a single rear camera, and it might share the iPhone 16's rear-panel manufacturing process.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple released the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> today, introducing small changes to a number of features throughout the operating system. There are no big additions in this beta, but Apple is continuing to refine existing settings and design choices.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple plans to continue updating &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; over the next few months, with the update set to be released this fall. We've rounded up all of the changes that we've found in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 4 so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>CarPlay Wallpapers</h2><br/>
Apple added new Light Mode and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a> wallpaper options for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, and the new wallpaper mirrors the wallpapers that have been added on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here are all 8 new CarPlay wallpapers in iOS 18 beta 4<br><br>Lightmode (1/2) <a href="https://t.co/KQGvubg9ym">pic.twitter.com/KQGvubg9ym</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1815816335957327895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<h2>Settings</h2><br/>
Apple has added a new way to access <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> settings in the Settings app. There's now an &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; option paired with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Game Center, and Wallet. &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; settings can still be accessed by tapping on your Apple Account and choosing &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; from that interface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-beta-4-icloud-setting.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959729" /><br/>
<h2>Camera Controls</h2><br/>
In the Camera section of the Settings app, there is a new "Controls Menu" option under Preserve Settings. The Controls Menu preserves the previously used camera tool when expanding the controls menu rather than showing the full list of camera control options when using the Camera app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-controls-menu.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959728" /><br/>
<h2>Hidden Folder</h2><br/>
Apple has changed the design of the Hidden folder in the App Library. Rather than showing an icon of an eye with a line through it, it is now blanked out app squares, which makes it stand out less.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-hidden-folder-change.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959727" /><br/>
<h2>Dark Mode/Light Mode Icons</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; and Light Mode icons are now appropriately synced to the Light and &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; settings on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when you use the "Automatic" setting under Customize. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-light-mode-dark-mode.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959726" /><br/>
With Automatic turned on, the icons now turn dark when &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; is activated and light when &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; is off. This wasn't working in prior betas.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Stocks Icon</h2><br/>
Apple tweaked the design of the Stocks app icon. The lines are subtler, and there is no longer a white haze over the bottom part of the icon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/apple-stocks-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959730" /><br/>
<h2>iPhone Mirroring</h2><br/>
This is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> feature more than an &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; feature, but when using &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring with &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta 4, you can change the size of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; window on your Mac's display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iphone-mirroring-larger-smaller.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959721" /><br/>
<h2>Control Center</h2><br/>
There's a new Control Center toggle for Bluetooth, but it is not yet working. Apple also added a Silent Mode/Mute toggle and an Accessibility Eye Mirroring option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-control-center-bluetooth-toggle.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959731" /><br/>
The Open Music Control Center option has been removed.<br/>
<br/>
These changes are also applicable to the Lock Screen Controls.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AssistiveTouch</h2><br/>
There are new Type to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Apple Watch Mirroring options available for AssistiveTouch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/type-to-siri-accessibility-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959732" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
There are additional references to Apple Intelligence features, which suggests Apple is continuing to prepare to implement Apple Intelligence in the beta in the not too distant future.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-4/">fourth beta of macOS Sequoia</a> that came out today, Apple added a useful new feature to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iphone-mirroring-larger-smaller.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959721" /><br/>
When you connect your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to your Mac, you can now make some changes to the window size, something that wasn't an option before. You can make the window bigger or smaller, changing the amount of screen space that it takes up on the Mac desktop.<br/>
<br/>
There are only three total sizes, including actual size, which is the size of your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display, smaller, and larger.<br/>
<br/>
The size options can be accessed by launching the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring app, connecting to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and then choosing your size from the View menu. There is no option to drag the window to resize, and you have to use the View options.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of upcoming an upcoming macOS 15 Sequoia update to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-3/">release of the third beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macOS-Sequoia-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955370" /><br/>
Registered developers can opt-in to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, which allows you to control your locked &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from your Mac. You can open and use &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps, interact with notifications, and drag and drop files between your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Mac and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
There are new options for window tiling, and dragging a window to the edge of the display will suggest a tiled location to make it easier to use multiple apps at once. Apple is adding a Passwords app for managing passwords, Safari can summarize websites and surface key information, and Notes has support for live audio transcription and math equations.<br/>
<br/>
All of the Apple Intelligence features coming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will also be available in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, but Apple does not plan to add these until later in the beta testing process. Apple Intelligence includes Writing Tools for editing, proofreading, and summarizing text in apps, and an Image Playground allows for AI images to be created from prompts.<br/>
<br/>
Custom emoji or "Genmoji" can be created for any situation and used just like emoji, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is getting much smarter. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do more in apps and will better understand requests, especially those made in regard to on-screen content.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; is available to developers right now, but Apple will release a public beta later this month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-4/">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of macOS Sequoia to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-macos-sequoia-to-developers.2432051/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the â€Œ&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;â€Œ Developer Beta setting. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, a set of AI features that are built deeply into the operating system. Apple Intelligence won't be coming until later in the beta testing process, but it includes features for refining and editing writing, generating images and emoji, and most notably, improving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and search. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is gaining a better understanding of natural language, improved contextual awareness, and the personal assistant will integrate with ChatGPT to answer more complex queries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads with an M-series chip, but there are a number of other features that are coming. Apple is allowing users to rearrange Home screen apps to have open spaces, plus there's a dark mode for app icons and tinting options.<br/>
<br/>
The Control Center is customizable and third-party developers can add controls for their apps, with the Lock Screen Flashlight and Camera icons able to be replaced or removed. Messages is gaining Rich Communication Services support to improve conversations with Android users, the option to schedule texts to be sent later, new text effects, messages over satellite when there's no cellular, and the option to use any emoji for Tapback responses.<br/>
<br/>
There's a dedicated Passwords app for logins, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes, and there's now an option to lock and hide apps, which means they can't be opened without secondary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication even when your phone is unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
Safari has a highlights feature that summarizes articles and surfaces key information on websites, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app interface has been overhauled, and there's a new Tap to Cash feature for privately and securely transferring money using Apple Cash. Other features include equation solving and voice memo transcription in Notes, a game mode for improving game performance, and an option to respond to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on AirPods with head gestures.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is only available to registered developers at the current time, but Apple plans to make a public beta later this month. &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; will see a public launch this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-4/">Apple Seeds Fourth Betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-betas-of-ios-18-and-ipados-18-to-developers.2432048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

We don't yet know what might be included in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.6, and no new features have been discovered in the betas so far. &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.6 is likely to see a release next week. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the fourth beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> update to developers, with the fourth beta coming two weeks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-3-to-developers/">after the third beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; is able to take the depth information from 2D photos and turn them into 3D photos using advanced machine learning. Apple says that the feature is meant to add depth to photos to make memories more immersive.<br/>
<br/>
There are new hand gestures for activating the Home View and Control Center, and the Home View is also now customizable with apps able to be rearranged. Travel Mode now includes support for trains, and Guest User profiles are now saved for 30 days so guests don't have to do the setup process every time they try out the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the year, Mac Virtual Display will support higher resolution and larger sized virtual displays, which Apple says will be equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. With an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> update, the Vision Pro can serve as an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; receiver, so content from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac can be shared to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Mindfulness app can track and respond to breathing patterns using the camera for an improved meditation experience, and the Vision Pro supports Bluetooth mice with &zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-4/">Apple Seeds Fourth visionOS 2 Beta to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-visionos-2-beta-to-developers.2432058/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the â€Œ&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; Developer Beta.

Once beta updates have been activated, &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; introduces a new Vitals app that aggregates health metrics collected during sleep like heart rate and respiratory rate, providing day-to-day health insights to track whether something has changed. There's also a Training Load feature for monitoring the intensity of workouts and how that impacts the body over time.<br/>
<br/>
The Smart Stack has been updated with new widgets and support for Live Activities and Translate, plus it is better able to suggest widgets based on time and daily routine. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> watch face includes suggestions for the best images to use, and the Check In safety feature now works with Workouts.<br/>
<br/>
Activity Rings can be customized to change the goals for each day, and there is an option to pause for rest days or when ill without losing an activity streak.

tvOS 18 adds an InSight feature to the TV app, and it is able to provide real-time information about actors, music, and more in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> shows and music.
