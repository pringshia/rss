		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is back this week with a big sale <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX23V2ZK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">across the MacBook Air lineup</a>, including both the M2 and M3 MacBook Air models. You can find many of the same deals being <a href="https://howl.me/cmVaWxMWwLT">matched at Best Buy</a>, and you won't need a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership in order to see the discounts this time around.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>13-Inch M2 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macbook-air-best-buy.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961113" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
Starting with the M2 MacBook Air, Amazon is offering &#36;200 off both models of the 2022 notebook. Prices start at &#36;799.00 for the 256GB M2 MacBook Air in all colors, and increase to &#36;999.00 for the 512GB MacBook Air in Midnight.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is offering an extended <a href="https://offers.applemusic.apple/2024-three-month-offer">three-month free Apple Music trial</a> for new users over the summer, provided they haven't been a subscriber to the streaming service before.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-music.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962031" /><br/>
‌Apple Music‌ typically offers a one-month free trial for new subscribers since it was shortened from three months in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/04/apple-music-one-month-trial/">2022</a>, so this deal is worth grabbing if you are curious about the service. <br/>
<br/>
Note that this offer is for new subscribers only. If you are not currently a subscriber to Apple Music, and you have never previously subscribed to Apple Music or Apple One, or had access to Apple Music through a Family plan, you are eligible for this offer.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/apple-music-is-currently-offering-new-subscribers-three-months-free-185834470.html?src=rss">Engadget</a></em> spotted the offer, which is running until September 23. After the trial ends, the service will automatically renew for &#36;11 per month, so it's a good idea to set a reminder in case you don't want to continue paying for access.<br/>
<br/>
To redeem the offer, open the Apple Music app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac and sign in with your Apple ID. If the offer doesn't appear immediately after launching the app, go to the Home tab where it will appear, then tap Accept Now.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/20/apple-music-free-three-month-trial/">Apple Music Offering Free Three-Month Trial for a Limited Time</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-offering-free-three-month-trial-for-a-limited-time.2433983/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A recent survey conducted by <a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/iphone-16-pre-launch-survey/">SellCell</a> suggests that a significant majority of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users are planning to upgrade to the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> series, with many expressing a preference for a better thermal design to prevent overheating issues. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Pro-Mock-Article.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924441" /><br/>
The survey, which polled over 2,000 US-based &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; owners (1,000 males and 1,000 females), found that 61.9% of respondents plan to purchase an &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; model upon release.<br/>
<br/>
Competitive pricing emerged as the most crucial factor, with 30.9% of respondents citing it as the primary influence on their decision to upgrade. But it was improved heat management that turned out to be another key area of interest, with 26.8% of users hoping for better thermal performance to prevent overheating issues. <br/>
<br/>
Shortly after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max were released last September, some customers began to experience an issue with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">devices overheating</a>. Apple eventually mitigated the problem with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">iOS 17 update</a>, but &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to be equipped with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/internal-change-to-iphone-16-models-expected-to-reduce-overheating/">new thermal design</a> to address potential overheating.<br/>
<br/>
The SellCell survey also revealed significant interest in Apple Intelligence capabilities for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. A striking 82.1% of respondents expressed willingness to wait up to a month after release for the AI features to be fully implemented. Apple plans to release Apple Intelligence features in an iOS 18.1 update that is expected to arrive in October.<br/>
<br/>
Another intriguing finding was the interest in larger displays for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; series. Despite the current &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max already boasting a 6.7-inch screen, over half of the respondents (54.9%) indicated they would welcome even bigger iPhones. The finding chimes with expectations that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models will have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/">slightly bigger displays</a>.<br/>
<br/>
However, there was a notable gender divide on the issue of display size. The majority of men (62.1%) were in favor of larger displays, while women are more evenly split, with 47.8% expressing interest in bigger screens. Some female respondents cited concerns about handling and holding larger devices comfortably.<br/>
<br/>
For those who said they won't be buying the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, most people (34.2%) cited the expense as the reason, closely followed by people who won't invest because they are keeping their existing phone (34.1%).<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in the second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 has added a set of new backgrounds for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls that showcase features of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macos-sequoia-facetime-backgrounds.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962006" /><br/>
There are nine backgrounds in all, featuring iconic locations around the company's circular headquarters in Cupertino, California, which should be familiar to anyone who has watched a recent Apple event.<br/>
<br/>
For example, one shows &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj;'s rainbow arch, based on the company's rainbow apple logo and erected as a tribute to its late co-founder Steve Jobs, who helped conceptualize the spaceship-like design of the main building on the campus prior to his death.<br/>
<br/>
In &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, there are other new built-in backgrounds that can be used for &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; and other video calls to blur out and hide what's behind you. These include different color gradients and the ability to use photos from your photo library.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; has also gained the ability to preview what you're going to share in a video call when using screen sharing. Video calling apps will now give you a small preview of what will be shared before you okay the sharing process, which is useful to double check that you're not sharing information you don't want everyone to see. <br/>

&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 is currently in its second developer beta phase and is expected to arrive for all users with supporting Macs later this year, following the release of &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15. Apple has split <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/does-my-iphone-support-apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> into a separate set of betas because these features will not be available in the initial launch version of ‌&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;‌.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/20/macos-sequoia-new-facetime-backgrounds/">macOS Sequoia Has New FaceTime Backgrounds Showcasing Apple Park</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-has-new-facetime-backgrounds-showcasing-apple-park.2433978/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple has reportedly been considering producing its high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Pro models in India for the last couple of years, and has now decided to manufacture the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max models in India. <br/>
<br/>
Initially, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will be imported into the country, but Apple will start local assembly for both the domestic market and exports shortly after launch in mid-September, once the new product introduction (NPI) process is complete.<br/>
<br/>
Training is said to be already underway for thousands of workers at Foxconn's factory in southern Tamil Nadu state as it rushes to produce the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models as close to the global launch as possible.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released an updated version of iOS 17.6.1, with the new software coming a week and a half after the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/07/apple-releases-ios-17-6-1/">original iOS 17.6.1 update</a>. The new version has a build number of 21G101, up from 21G93.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960873" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-17.6.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
iOS 17.6.1 can be downloaded on eligible iPhones and iPads over-the-air by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, the iOS 17.6.1 update addresses an issue that could prevent the enabling or disabling of Advanced Data Protection. It is not clear what is different between the new version of the software and the original version.<br/>
<blockquote>This update includes important bug fixes and addresses an issue that prevents enabling or disabling Advanced Data Protection.</blockquote><br/>
The Advanced Data Protection bug impacted a small number of users. Those who tried to turn Advanced Data Protection on and weren't able to get it enabled saw an error message and it was clear it wasn't active. Affected users who tried to turn it off saw it disabled in the interface, though it was actually still active for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> data.<br/>
<br/>
Both of those bugs have been fixed in the update. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who had the bug that prevented Advanced Data Protection from properly turning off will see a notification that asks them to confirm the decision to turn the feature off after installing iOS 17.6.1. Apple says that the few users who experienced this bug had an expected level of security or more, in the situation where ADP did not turn off as expected.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/apple-re-releases-ios-17-6-1/">Apple Re-Releases iOS 17.6.1 With Advanced Data Protection Bug Fix</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-re-releases-ios-17-6-1-with-advanced-data-protection-bug-fix.2433936/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced the launch of a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com">Podcasts on the web feature</a>, which works in Safari, Chrome, Edge, and Firefox on Macs, PCs, and other devices. Podcasts on the web allows users to search for, browse through, and listen to podcasts with access to the Up Next queue and library when signed in to an Apple Account.<br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> on the web works like the &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; app, and users can subscribe to and get updates for their favorite shows. Apple has long had a podcasts feature that allowed podcasts to be listened to on the web when embedded in an article, but now there is a dedicated website on devices without a Podcasts app. <br/>
<br/>

You can check out Podcasts on the web by going to Apple's <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com">podcasts.apple.com site</a>. Note that if you have the Podcasts app installed on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac, the website will open the app automatically rather than directing you to the web.<br/>
<br/>
Podcasts on the web comes a month after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-maps-now-available-on-the-web/">introduced Apple Maps on the web</a>, which serves as an alternative to Google Maps.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/apple-podcasts-now-available-on-the-web/">Apple Podcasts Now Available on the Web</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-podcasts-now-available-on-the-web.2433933/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 18: Replace or Remove Lock Screen Camera and Flashlight Icons</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 18, currently in beta, Apple is allowing iPhone users to replace the flashlight and camera buttons on the Lock Screen with something more useful, or to make them disappear entirely.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-lock-screen-buttons.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954622" /><br/>
The dedicated flashlight and camera shortcuts you see at the bottom of your iPhone's Lock Screen were introduced in their current form with the release of iOS 11 alongside the iPhone X in 2018, and the two icons have since been a staple, non-customizable feature.<br/>
<br/>
But that's all set to change this September with the launch of iOS 18. The Lock Screen buttons on your iPhone can now be replaced with any Control Center option. This includes system features like Dark Mode, Airplane Mode, Accessibility options, Calculator, and Translate, as well as Shortcuts – making the functional possibilities endless. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-the-ios-18-public-beta/">How to Install the Third iOS 18 Public Beta</a></li></ul><br/>
The change in iOS 18 is part of a broader Control Center redesign, significantly expanding the quick access potential from the Lock Screen. Apple has also opened up this functionality to third-party apps, allowing their icons to be added to the Control Center and, by extension, the Lock Screen buttons. <br/>
<br/>
To maintain user privacy and data security, certain options may require Face ID or Touch ID authentication before granting access from the Lock Screen. This ensures that sensitive information remains protected even with this increased accessibility.<br/>
<br/>
The following steps explain how to switch up your Lock Screen buttons in iOS 18:<br/>
<ol><br/>
    <li>Press and hold on the Lock Screen after authenticating.</li><br/>
    <li>Tap <strong>Customize</strong>.</li><br/>
    <li>Tap <strong>Lock Screen</strong>.</li><br/>
    <li>From there, tap the "<strong>-</strong>" icon to remove apps that are assigned to those buttons. The Flashlight and Camera apps are the default, so they will need to be removed.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/change-lock-screen-icons2.jpg" alt="Lock Screen" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961941" /><br/>
    <li>Next, tap the "<strong>+</strong>" button and choose a new control to add from the scrolling menu of options.</li><br/>
<li>Repeat for the second Lock Screen button if desired.</li><br/>
    <li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top-right corner to finish.<br/>

</ol>Don't forget that if you replace the camera button or remove it completely, you can still easily access the Camera app from the Lock Screen by swiping left across the screen.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/customize-iphone-lock-screen-buttons/">iOS 18: Replace or Remove Lock Screen Camera and Flashlight Icons</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-replace-or-remove-lock-screen-camera-and-flashlight-icons.2433923/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> illustration app Procreate today <a href="https://procreate.com/ai">announced</a> that it has no plans to bring generative AI to its software, setting itself apart from many competitors who have embraced the technology.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-pencil.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939786" /><br/>
The decision comes at a time when many companies in the digital art space, such as Adobe, are rapidly integrating AI capabilities into their products and services. Procreate's stance is grounded in a commitment to preserving what it describes as the "humanity" of creative work. The company issued a statement on its website that expressed strong reservations about the impact of generative AI on the creative process:<blockquote>Generative AI is ripping the humanity out of things. Built on a foundation of theft, the technology is steering us toward a barren future. We think machine learning is a compelling technology with a lot of merit, but the path generative AI is on is wrong for us.<br/>
<br/>
We're here for the humans. We're not chasing a technology that is a moral threat to our greatest jewel: human creativity. In this technological rush, this might make us an exception or seem at risk of being left behind. But we see this road less travelled as the more exciting and fruitful one for our community.</blockquote>James Cuda, the CEO of Procreate, reinforced the position in a <a href="https://x.com/Procreate/status/1825311104584802470">video posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter), expressing his dislike of generative AI and explaining that Procreate's products are designed with the intention that "a human will be creating something." The announcement appears to have resonated with many digital artists who have expressed concerns about the integration of AI into creative tools.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/procreate/">Procreate</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/procreate-condemns-ai/">iPad Illustration App Procreate Condemns Generative AI</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-illustration-app-procreate-condemns-generative-ai.2433922/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's rumored tabletop robot has been spotted in its global supply chain for the first time, Taiwan's <a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7240/8170073"><em>United Daily News</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Apple-Robot-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961758" /><br/>
Apple has apparently chosen Hongzhun to play a critical role in the development of the forthcoming device. Specifically, the supplier will be responsible for developing key mechanical components and casings for the tabletop robot. Once the product moves into mass production, Hongzhun will be tasked with producing the mechanical parts on a large scale. Hongzhun is a subsidiary of Foxconn, a longstanding manufacturing partner of Apple. <br/>
<br/>
At its most recent shareholders' meeting, Hongzhun announced its intention to invest in emerging technologies such as robotics and AI, signaling a move away from its traditional focus on producing casings for laptops and game consoles. Hongzhun has prior experience in assembling Foxconn's own "FoxBot" robot.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's robot project, reportedly code-named J595 internally, is described <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a> as a desktop device that combines an iPad-like display with a robotic arm. It is designed to serve as a central hub in Apple's smart home ecosystem, integrating with other Apple products and services like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, and run a variant of iPadOS. It could be introduced as soon as 2026, with an estimated price tag of approximately &#36;1,000.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-robot/">Apple Robot</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/">Foxconn</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/apple-robot-spotted-in-supply-chain/">First Plans for Apple&#039;s Tabletop Robot Spotted in Supply Chain</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-plans-for-apples-tabletop-robot-spotted-in-supply-chain.2433913/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple still plans to refresh its entry-level and mid-tier AirPods later this year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/AirPods-Fourth-Generation-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905652" /><br/>
Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-18/why-is-apple-building-own-modem-company-plays-long-game-in-dropping-qualcomm-lzzk8616">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman reiterated his previous reporting by saying that Apple intends to release two versions at different price points, replacing the current second-generation and third-generation models.<br/>
<br/>
Both models will feature a redesigned look, including a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port, shorter stems similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, along with an updated fit and enhanced audio quality.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end version is expected to include Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), making ANC available at a lower price point for the first time and no longer exclusive to &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said Apple intends to launch a third-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; "later," by which he likely means next year, based on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/17/airpods-4-production-and-launch-timing/">previous reporting</a>.<br/>

What Gurman did not mention in his latest update is the status of new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. It's been almost four years since Apple introduced its premium over-ear headphones.

		<description><![CDATA[The new bronze-like color rumored to be replacing Blue Titanium in Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro lineup may be called "Desert Titanium," according to the leaker known as "Majin Bu."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iphone-16-pro-bronze.jpg" alt="bronze" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961906" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Concept render of new iPhone 16 Pro color</em></div><br/>
Bu referenced the name on Sunday in a <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1825156368195584032">post</a> on X (Twitter) in which they shared an image of camera lens rings purportedly destined for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models.<br/>
<br/>
"The desert titanium color is kind of dark gold, similar to the old purple color, relatively discreet and deep," said Bu. This isn't the first time the leaker has used the name "Desert Titanium" in reference to the new color, which has variously been described as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/16/iphone-16-pro-colors-revealed/">rose or rose-gold</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/new-iphone-16-pro-color-bronze-appearance/">bronze-like</a>. Back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-16-pro-two-new-color-options/">February</a>, Bu said that the "Desert Titanium" will be similar to the Gold color option offered on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, but "deeper and heavier." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/camera-lens-rings-iphone16-pro.jpeg" alt="lens rings" width="1289" height="728" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961904" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Alleged camera lens rings for iPhone 16 Pro models</em></div><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro will introduce "Desert Titanium" as a new color option, replacing the iPhone 15 Pro's "Blue Titanium". It will be available alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/16/iphone-16-pro-colors-revealed/">White, Black, and Natural Titanium</a>. This year's Black Titanium is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/iphone-16-pro-colors-shown-leaked-image/">darker</a>, while Natural Titanium will have a more pronounced gray finish.<br/>
<br/>
One <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/">rumor</a> suggests that Apple is using an improved process for finishing and coloring titanium, which will result in a glossier look than the brushed aluminum finish of the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models. The glossy finish could look much more like the stainless steel that Apple used in prior years, but it will be more resistant to scratches.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Almost all of Apple's built-in apps are getting new features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and that includes the Maps app. The Maps app isn't getting any fun new AI additions, but Apple does have some useful changes in store.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Generic-iOS-18-Maps-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961870" /><br/>
<h2 id="hiking_trails">Hiking Trails</h2><br/>
Apple added topographic maps to the Apple Watch last year, and now detailed topographic maps are also coming to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The Maps app features detailed trail networks and hikes, including all 63 U.S. national parks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-hikes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961875" /><br/>
You can do a search for "hikes" or "hiking routes" in the Maps app to see nearby trail options, with Apple including hike length, elevation, ratings, and other details.<br/>
<br/>
Hikes can be filtered by length, route type (loop, point to point, or out and back), and elevation, and can be saved for offline access.<br/>

You can zoom into hiking areas to see specific trails, or search for trails. If you tap on a trail, Apple has information that includes length, highest point, lowest point, and distance. You can also see a full overview of the trail's path and get lengths for each section.<br/>
<br/>

Trails and hikes are separate entities in the Maps app. A search for hikes essentially brings you to the general area where specific trails are located, and you can zoom in with the Maps app to find the trail you want to take.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="custom_routes">Custom Routes</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> supports custom routes in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, so you can plan out a specific hiking route that you want to take. At a trailhead, you can tap on the "Create a Custom Route" option to initiate the custom routing experience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-custom-route.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961878" /><br/>
From there, you tap on the map to begin setting points for your route, and the Maps app will provide length and elevation details. You can also have the Maps app finish a route automatically by tapping on the Reverse, Out and Back, or Close Loop options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-custom-route-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961879" /><br/>
For hikes and trails, the Maps app will not let you create an unsafe route that does not stick to existing trails, so it's difficult to make a dangerous map out into the middle of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
Route creation is not limited to hikes and trails. You can add a pinned spot to a map, tap on the "More" option and choose Create Custom Route.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="search_here">Search Here</h2><br/>
Apple made it easier to search in locations you might be thinking of visiting or those you want to explore by adding a "Search here" button. If you look up a place, such as San Diego, and then tap on search, it'll search in the area that's on your screen rather at your physical location.<br/>
<br/>
If you search for something and then pan around the map, the search will update reliably in the new location. When you zoom in, you'll see a dedicated "Search here" button that gives you more control over where you want to search.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="saving_favorites">Saving Favorites</h2><br/>
If you find a favorite hike, trail, or custom route, you can save it to your Library to save it for later. To do so, find the relevant hike and then tap on the "Add to Library" button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-trail-save-library.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961880" /><br/>
You can rename hikes and add specific information that you might want to revisit later, as well as download the route for offline usage.<br/>
<br/>
Tapping on the "+" button when viewing any location on the map, including a hike, will also add that location to the library.<br/>
<br/>
Favorites are stored in the Maps app and can be accessed by tapping on your profile picture and choosing the Library section.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="library">Library</h2><br/>
All saved content from the Maps app including locations, routes, guides, and pins are stored in the new Library section of the Maps app rather than in separate sections as in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-library.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961881" /><br/>
The Library also shows all of your Recently Added content.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><br/>
You can tap on any place in the Maps app and select the Add a Note option from the menu. From there, you can make a note about what you want to remember about a location.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-add-a-note.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961882" /><br/>
Notes are private and are kept on-device. They are only visible to the note creator.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of iOS 18.1 this fall, Apple will allow third-party developers to support NFC contactless transactions for payments and more. Right now, the NFC chip is locked down, and it's primarily only used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, but a number of new capabilities will be coming when Apple expands access to NFC.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Tap-to-Pay-on-iPhone-avail-FR-transaction.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922462" /><br/>
<h2 id="nfc_capabilities_in_third-party_apps">NFC Capabilities in Third-Party Apps</h2><br/>
With NFC access, banks will be able to offer direct contactless payment options that serve as an alternative to &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, but it app developers will be able to do more, too. Some ways Apple says NFC can be used:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Contactless payments in stores</li><br/>
 <li>Car keys</li><br/>
 <li>Closed-loop transit cards</li><br/>
 <li>Corporate badges</li><br/>
 <li>Student IDs</li><br/>
 <li>Government IDs (coming in the future)</li><br/>
 <li>Home keys</li><br/>
 <li>Hotel keys</li><br/>
 <li>Merchant loyalty and reward cards</li><br/>
 <li>Event tickets</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="security_protections">Security Protections</h2><br/>
Apple is creating several new APIs that will power the contactless transactions. The APIs will use the Secure Enclave in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, with sensitive information stored directly on device.<br/>
<br/>
Developers will have to request access to the NFC and Secure Enclave entitlement, sign a commercial agreement with Apple, and pay associated fees. Apple plans to make sure that only authorized developers who meet regulatory and industry requirements and commit to Apple's security and privacy standards can get access to the APIs.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="default_contactless_app_options">Default Contactless App Options</h2><br/>
Once these features go live, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users can open up the app and then hold the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; near an NFC terminal to make a payment. So if you want to pay at a store using your bank's NFC payment service, you'd open your bank app and then double-click the side button on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to initiate a transaction.<br/>
<br/>
Third-party apps will also be able to be set as default contactless apps in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
Transactions will be verified with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_pay_and_apple_wallet">Apple Pay and Apple Wallet</h2><br/>
The NFC APIs are separate from &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; and Apple Wallet, which is why you will need to open up a third-party app to use its NFC capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="available_countries">Available Countries</h2><br/>
Apple's NFC and Secure Enclave APIs are coming to developers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the UK, and the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Support will come to additional locations in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-opens-iphone-nfc-access-eu/">already opened up</a> the NFC chip in the European Economic Area.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ios_18.1_launch_date">iOS 18.1 Launch Date</h2><br/>
The new APIs will launch in iOS 18.1, which is an update that Apple is testing at the current time. iOS 18.1 will likely be released a few weeks after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and we are expecting to see it sometime in October.<br/>
<br/>
In past years, .1 updates have come out between October 20 and October 25, so the week of October 21 is likely when we will see iOS 18.1 come out.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/">NFC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-nfc-chip-ios-18-1/">Apple is Opening Up the iPhone&#039;s NFC Chip: What You Need to Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-is-opening-up-the-iphones-nfc-chip-what-you-need-to-know.2433801/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
