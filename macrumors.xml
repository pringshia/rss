		<description><![CDATA[Today on Amazon you can get Apple's AirPods Pro 2 at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.00</strong></a>, down from the original price of &#36;249.00. Amazon provides an estimated delivery date between September 9 and September 13 for most residences in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Red-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895408" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This has been one of the most consistent deals on the AirPods Pro 2 all year, and is about &#36;5 away from the all-time low price that we last saw in March. Given that we haven't tracked that rare sale again, we definitely recommend jumping on this deal if you've been waiting for a deal on the AirPods Pro 2.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 for &#36;199.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
This model of the AirPods Pro can charge via Lightning, Qi, or an Apple Watch charger. We're expecting Apple to introduce a model that adds USB-C charging to the AirPods Pro 2 next week, but it could be a while before those models are discounted.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The macOS 13.5.2, iOS 16.6.1, iPadOS 16.6.1, and watchOS 9.6.2 updates that Apple released today includes fixes for security vulnerabilities that Apple says may have been actively exploited in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903333" /><br/>
According to Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222">security support page</a>, in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, processing a maliciously crafted image could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing a hacker to gain access to the operating system with a simple picture. Apple fixed the ImageIO process by addressing a buffer overflow issue to improve memory handling.<br/>
<br/>
In iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS, a maliciously crafted attachment in the Wallet app could also lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple addressed the validation issue with improved logic.<br/>
<br/>
As these updates include important security fixes, everyone should install iOS 16.6.1, iPadOS 16.6.1, macOS 13.5.2, and watchOS 9.6.2 as soon as possible. Apple recommends these software updates for all users.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/">iOS 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/">iPadOS 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/">macOS Ventura</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238">iOS 16</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239">macOS Ventura</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/ios-16-6-1-macos-13-5-2-active-vulnerabilities/">PSA: Make Sure to Update, iOS 16.6.1 and macOS 13.5.2 Address Actively Exploited Vulnerability</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-make-sure-to-update-ios-16-6-1-and-macos-13-5-2-address-actively-exploited-vulnerability.2400732/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released iOS 16.6.1, iPadOS 16.6.1, and watchOS 9.6.2, minor updates for the iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS operating systems that came out last September. The launch of iOS 16.6.1 comes over a month after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-releases-ios-16-6/">release of iOS 16.6</a>, an update that brought bug fixes. <br/>
<br/>

watchOS 9.6.2 can be downloaded for free through the Apple Watch app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> by opening it up and going to General > Software Update.

		<description><![CDATA[China earlier this week banned government officials from using iPhones and other foreign smartphones for work or from bringing such devices to their government offices, and now China is expanding the ban. According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-07/china-plans-to-expand-iphone-ban-to-some-state-backed-firms-in-blow-to-apple">Bloomberg</a></em>, multiple state agencies and state companies have started telling workers not to bring their iPhones in to their jobs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/iPhone-14-Pros-in-Hand-Black-Background-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1404" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-864576" /><br/>
The restriction is expected to expand to additional government-controlled organizations in the future as China aims to block foreign technology. China does not yet have a formal injunction, so it is not yet known how many companies may adopt the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> restrictions. China has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Government-owned_companies_of_China">huge number</a> of state-owned enterprises in power generation, seaport construction, mining, manufacturing, education, and investment markets. Foreign devices have historically been discouraged in sensitive agencies, but China is now taking a firmer stance.<br/>
<br/>
China is an important market for Apple, and the ban could push customers to purchase Chinese-made devices if they are unable to use their personal iPhones for much of the day. <em>Bloomberg</em> suggests that the strictness of the bans could vary from company to company, with some banning Apple products from the workplace and some preventing employees from using Apple devices entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Apple stock has been dropping since yesterday, and it is down over 5 percent as of Thursday.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/china-expanding-government-iphone-ban/">China Expanding Government iPhone Ban</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/china-expanding-government-iphone-ban.2400723/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week started selling certified refurbished 15-inch MacBook Air models through its online store in select European countries, as <a href="https://twitter.com/SaranByte/status/1699767645082390757">noted by @SaranByte on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter. So far, these countries <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/mac/2023-macbook-air">include the U.K.</a>, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Switzerland. Availability will likely expand to the U.S., Canada, and additional countries within the next few weeks.<br/>
<br/>

As usual for refurbished Macs, prices are discounted by approximately 15% compared to brand new models. A variety of configurations are available to order.<br/>
<br/>
Apple inspects, cleans, tests, and repackages all refurbished Macs to ensure they are fully functional and in good condition, and Apple's refurbished products are covered by a one-year limited warranty and eligible for AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the 15-inch MacBook Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/wwdc-2023-recap/">at WWDC in June</a>, with pricing starting at &#36;1,299 in the U.S. The laptop has the same overall design and M2 chip as the 13-inch MacBook Air, but it features a larger display and two additional speakers. The laptop is available in four color options: Midnight, Starlight, Space Gray, and Silver.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max will be priced at &#36;1,099 and &#36;1,199 in a &#36;100 price increase over the current models, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Pro-Colors-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-907572" /><br/>
In an investor note seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, Ives becomes the latest analyst to emphasize the expected price rises for Apple's Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, which have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-pro-models-expected-to-be-more-expensive/">widely reported</a> in recent months. He also reinforced previous reports that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and 15 Plus will maintain the same pricing as the current models.<br/>
<br/>
Ives believes there will be considerable promotional activities and discounts from U.S. carriers in the coming months. Such initiatives are likely to further drive sales for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, offsetting potential resistance from the price increment. He also highlighted that 25 percent of Apple's 1.2 billion user base has not upgraded their devices in over four years. This apparently indicates a significant pent-up demand that could lead to what Ives terms a "mini super cycle."<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-price-hike-iphone-15-pro-models/">contemplating raising the price</a> for both the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. Analyst Jeff Pu has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-15-pro-max-more-expensive/">also said</a> that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models could be more expensive than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> models. Most recently, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em>' Luke Lin noted the impending "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/major-price-hike-rumored-for-iphone-15-pro-models/">major price hike</a>" for Apple's upcoming Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models. The entire &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup is due to be unveiled at Apple's "Wonderlust" event on Tuesday, September 12.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wedbush/">Wedbush</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/iphone-15-pro-models-rumored-to-see-price-increase/">iPhone 15 Pro Models Again Rumored to See &#36;100 Price Increase</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-models-again-rumored-to-see-100-price-increase.2400695/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
A provision in the bill allows regulator Ofcom to order messaging services to use "accredited technology" to look for and take down child sexual abuse material. <br/>
<br/>
However, according to a <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/770e58b1-a299-4b7b-a129-bded8649a43b">Financial Times</a></em> report, the British government's minister for arts and heritage, Stephen Parkinson, said on Wednesday that Ofcom would only be able to intervene if scanning content was "technically feasible" and if the process met minimum standards of privacy and accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
Many security experts believe that such tech tools may never exist, while tech firms have argued that content moderation policies such as client-side scanning are impossible to implement without circumventing end-to-end encryption, which ensures that only the user and the person they are communicating with can read or listen to what is sent.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has threatened to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/20/apple-threatens-to-pull-facetime-and-imessage-uk/">pull services including FaceTime and iMessage</a> in the UK if the online safety bill goes ahead in its current form, while WhatsApp and Signal have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/whatsapp-signal-open-letter-uk-government/">said they will quit the UK altogether</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the government's apparent concession to tech companies' arguments, technology minister Michelle Donelan on Thursday denied that the bill had changed, arguing that if necessary it will still require companies to work to develop technology to scan encrypted messages if they cannot take action to stop child abuse on their platforms. <br/>
<br/>
Donelan <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/uk-minister-says-position-encryption-not-changed-2023-09-07/">told reporters</a> further work to develop the technology was needed, adding that government-funded research had shown it was possible, however she did not offer evidence to back her claim.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/">Encryption</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/uk-government-plan-scan-encrypted-messages/">UK Government Denies U-Turn on Plan to Scan Encrypted Messages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-government-denies-u-turn-on-plan-to-scan-encrypted-messages.2400680/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17, expected to be released in September, if you change your iPhone's passcode and forget it soon after, Apple now offers you a 72-hour grace period to fix it without getting locked out of your device. Here's how it works.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-passcode-green.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886806" /><br/>
In iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, it is now possible to reset an iPhone or iPad's new passcode with the previous passcode you used for up to three days after the change is made. In other words, Apple lets you use your old passcode within 72 hours of setting a new one, which is handy if you're someone who is likely to forget a newly created passcode.<br/>
<br/>
When you enter an incorrect passcode on a device running iOS 17 after making a change, simply tap on the <strong>Forgot Passcode?</strong> option at the bottom of the display to use the <strong>Try Passcode Reset</strong> option. Tapping it allows you to use your old passcode to create yet another new passcode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iOS-17-Passcode-Reset-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900579" /><br/>
For protection in case someone has learned your passcode, there is also an "Expire Previous Passcode Now" setting that you can make use of. (Note that if you use this option, you'll no longer be able to use your old passcode to gain access to your device if you forget your new passcode.) To use the new option in iOS 17, follow these steps:<br/>
<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and select <strong>Face ID</strong>/<strong>Touch ID & Passcode</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under "Temporary Passcode Reset," tap <strong>Expire Previous Passcode Now</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Expire Now</strong> to confirm.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/expire-previous-passcode.jpg" alt="settings" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909228" /><br/>
<br/>
It is still possible to change an Apple ID account's password with an iPhone's passcode, despite a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report in February highlighting instances of thieves <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/24/iphone-stolen-passcodes-report/">spying on iPhone users in public</a> when they enter their passcode, and then stealing the device in order to gain widespread access to the device. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi in June 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/10/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2023/">said</a> Apple has continued to "look at other ways to address this," but no changes have been made as of yet. To make theft harder, Apple recommends that users switch from a four-digit passcode to an alphanumeric passcode, which would be more difficult for thieves to spy on. This can also be done in <strong>Settings</strong> under <strong>Face ID & Passcode -> Change Passcode</strong>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/">Apple Security</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-change-your-new-passcode-if-you-forget-it/">iOS 17: How to Change a New iPhone Passcode If You Forget It</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-how-to-change-a-new-iphone-passcode-if-you-forget-it.2400676/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today sent out emails inviting developers to visit the Apple Developer Center in Cupertino, California for a workshop on app optimization. Apple says that developers can learn to maximize app performance to "give people a great experience."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Apple-Park-View.jpeg" alt="" width="1440" height="790" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-854420" /><br/>
Attendees will learn how to optimize Apple frameworks and what Apple tools can be used for identifying and resolving performance issues. Apple engineers will be on hand to provide support, app testing, and advice.<br/>
<br/>
The all-day event that runs from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time is set to take place at the Apple Developer Center on September 27, 2023. The event is free, and registration is first come, first serve. It is not clear how many spots are open to developers<blockquote>Join us for an all-day, in-person event and discover how to improve your app experience by maximizing performance. Learn how to optimize your use of Apple frameworks, identify and resolve performance issues with tools like Instruments and Xcode Organizer, and get advice from Apple engineers on reducing launch time, hang rate, memory footprint, and more. Plus, you'll have the opportunity to test your apps and get hands-on support. Hosted at the Apple Developer Center in Cupertino.</blockquote>Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/05/apple-developer-center-opens/">opened the Apple Developer Center</a> in June of 2022, just ahead of the 2022 Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple has described the Developer Center as a "world class facility" where developers can meet with Apple engineers, designers, and experts.<br/>
<br/>
There are dedicated lab areas at the Developer Center, along with work pods, briefing centers, a studio with stage, and more. Meeting rooms are named after prior macOS releases, and the studio room is named Big Sur.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of WWDC 2022 and 2023, Apple has extended limited invitations to developers to visit the Developer Center at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a>. The September 27 meetings will take place following the introduction of new iPhones on September 12 and after the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, which we are expecting to see released around September 20.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-developer-center-app-optimization-event/">Apple Invites Developers to Cupertino for Workshop on Optimizing Apps for Performance and Battery Life</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-invites-developers-to-cupertino-for-workshop-on-optimizing-apps-for-performance-and-battery-life.2400661/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 178 includes fixes and updates for Web Inspector, CSS, CSS Container Queries, JavaScript, SVG, Accessibility, Media, IntersectionObserver, Web API, and WebGL.<br/>
<br/>
The update now features content coming in Safari 17 alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>. On Sonoma, the browser offers Profiles for separating browsing data like History and Favorites, web apps, and improved private browsing mode. Features for all operating systems include Feature Flags (replacing Experimental Features), a redesigned Develop menu, Live Text support for vertical text recognition in images and videos, HEIC support, and JPEG XL, a new image format with an improved compression algorithm for better image quality at smaller file sizes than JPEG.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/">macOS Ventura</a> and &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, the latest version of macOS that Apple is beta testing right now.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-178/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 178 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-178-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2400656/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in iOS 18 plans to use language models to make <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> smarter, according to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-boosts-spending-to-develop-conversational-ai">The Information</a></em>. Apple wants &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to be able to help users automate complex, multi-step tasks with voice-based commands.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
As an example, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; might be able to do something like take a series of five photos, turn them into a GIF, and send the resulting GIF to a friend, all as one single action. Automatically converting photos into a GIF is possible right now with the Shortcuts app, but it has to be set up manually.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s functionality will be similar to what's possible with the Shortcuts app, and it is likely that it will see &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; integrating more deeply with Shortcuts. Shortcuts have become a key part of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> operating system and can be used for some powerful automated actions. Apple maintains a gallery of Shortcut options for everything from removing backgrounds from images to creating chore lists.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em> says that Apple is aiming to release the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities as part of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s operating system next year, which suggests that it will be part of iOS 18. Apple competitor Google is also working to upgrade Google Assistant with language model software able to handle more complex tasks, so Apple may want to beat Google to the punch or at least launch similar functionality around the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; personal assistant has long been criticized for being notably behind voice assistants from other companies like Google and Alexa, primarily due to Apple's focus on security and privacy. Many &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; tasks are performed on-device rather than through a cloud server, so Apple will need to find a balance between privacy and functionality with the adoption of language models for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> update that is set to see a public release in just a couple of weeks has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-siri-spotlight/">very little in the way of new Siri functionality</a>, but there is key functionality that would be a precursor to multi-step tasks. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; able to recognize and respond to multiple back-to-back requests without needing to be reactivated, something not possible in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/">iOS 16</a>. You can, for example, ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; the time and follow that up with a request to text your friend that you're going to be late without two separate requests.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Apple is also eliminating the "Hey" wake word, so you are now able to just say "&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;" to activate the personal assistant. Eliminating "Hey" allows for more natural &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interactions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple follows a strict schedule for its software releases, so we can expect to see iOS 18's feature set unveiled at the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">iOS 18 Rumored to Feature Major Siri Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumored-to-feature-major-siri-improvements.2400649/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has significantly ramped up its spending on artificial intelligence, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-boosts-spending-to-develop-conversational-ai">The Information</a></em> that highlights Apple's AI and machine learning research.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/siri-glow.png" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-809517" /><br/>
Though Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea is said to be skeptical of AI chatbots, he established a team that is working on conversational AI four years ago. We have heard prior rumors about "Apple GPT" from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. Gurman in July said that Apple was experimenting with large language models, and some Apple employees have access to an "Ajax" internal chatbot.<br/>
<br/>
With the 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, chatbots suddenly became the must-have feature. Microsoft and Google have both launched chatbots, but there are so far no signs that Apple has a consumer-oriented product launching in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's "Foundational Models" team that works on conversational AI includes just 16 people, but Apple is spending millions of dollars per day training its language models. Training large language models requires a lot of hardware, and as an example, OpenAI Sam Altman said the company <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-the-age-of-giant-ai-models-is-already-over/">spent more than &#36;100 million</a> for GPT-4.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>The Information</em>, Apple has other AI goals. The company is aiming to develop a feature that would allow a voice assistant like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> to automate multi-step tasks. That functionality is available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> today, but workflows must be manually set up using the Shortcuts app.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; team could have multi-step voice-controlled automation ready for use in iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also appears to have AI teams that are working on software to generate videos and images and multimodal AI that works with images, video, and text. The aforementioned Ajax chatbot that Apple is working with is supposedly more capable than the original ChatGPT 3.5 and has been trained on 200 billion parameters, but OpenAI's newer models are more powerful.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applegpt/">AppleGPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">Apple Spending Millions of Dollars a Day on Conversational AI</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-spending-millions-of-dollars-a-day-on-conversational-ai.2400638/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to use its own modem chip for iPhones starting in 2025, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/qualcomm-is-the-main-loser-from-huaweis-adoption-of-kirin9000s-and-new-kirin-chips-e96080908f5c">information shared today</a> by supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. He previously said the fourth-generation iPhone SE would be Apple's first device with the custom-designed 5G modem, but it's not entirely clear if this is still the plan anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/5G-Modem-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886940" /><br/>
In July, it was reported that mass-production of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/05/iphone-se-4-rumor-recap/">fourth-generation iPhone SE was delayed until 2025</a>, so there is still a chance that it could be the first device with Apple's modem, but there have been conflicting rumors about the project.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly been planning its own modem for over five years, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/">acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> in 2019. Based on the 2025 timeframe, iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models are expected to stick with Qualcomm modems. The switch to an Apple modem could begin with a future iPhone SE and iPhone 17 models, if previously reported <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/28/apple-5g-modem-failed-qualcomm-remains-supplier/">development challenges</a> can be overcome.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear if an Apple-designed 5G modem would have any consumer benefits over Qualcomm modems, but it would reduce Apple's reliance on Qualcomm on the supplier side. In 2017, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/20/apple-qualcomm-1-billion-lawsuit/">Apple sued Qualcomm</a> over alleged anticompetitive practices and &#36;1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's 256GB M2 Mac mini has returned to its all-time low price on B&H Photo, available for <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746353-REG/apple_mmfj3ll_a_mac_mini_with_m2.html/kw/APMMM2256/BI/2696/KBID/3612"><strong>&#36;499.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;599.00. B&H Photo offers free two-day shipping on the Mac mini, with delivery as soon as September 8 for most states.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/mac-mini-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905646" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Apple updated the Mac mini back in January, introducing the M2 and M2 Pro chips into the computer. We started tracking this all-time low price tag around springtime and as of now only B&H Photo is offering the sale.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746353-REG/apple_mmfj3ll_a_mac_mini_with_m2.html/kw/APMMM2256/BI/2696/KBID/3612"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>M2 Mac mini (256GB) for &#36;499.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
B&H Photo also has the 512GB M2 Pro Mac mini for <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746367-REG/apple_mnh73ll_a_mac_mini_with_m2.html/kw/APMMM2P512/BI/2696/KBID/3612"><strong>&#36;1,149.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,299.00. This one is a second-best price on the Mac Mini, but it's been a few months since we last tracked a record low price on the model so it's still a solid price for anyone in the market for the M2 Pro model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746367-REG/apple_mnh73ll_a_mac_mini_with_m2.html/kw/APMMM2P512/BI/2696/KBID/3612"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;150 OFF</div>M2 Pro Mac mini (512GB) for &#36;1,149.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While major new macOS versions were released in October or November for the past four years, there is a chance that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> could be released in September this year, based on how beta testing of the update is progressing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-feature-green-brown.jpg" alt="" width="2585" height="1454" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898567" /><br/>
As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1697034450683490458">@iSWUpdates on X</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-beta-7/">seventh beta of macOS Sonoma</a> seeded to developers last week has a build number ending in "a," while the seventh beta of macOS Ventura had a build number ending in "f" last year. A build number ending with an earlier letter in the alphabet typically indicates that beta testing is closer to completion.<br/>
<br/>
macOS Mojave was released in September back in 2018. The seventh beta of that update also had a build number ending in "a."<br/>
<br/>
macOS release dates since 2016:<ul><li><strong>macOS Sierra:</strong> September 20, 2016</li><br/>
<li><strong>macOS High Sierra:</strong> September 25, 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>macOS Mojave:</strong> September 24, 2018</li><br/>
<li><strong>macOS Catalina:</strong> October 7, 2019</li><br/>
<li><strong>macOS Big Sur:</strong> November 12, 2020</li><br/>
<li><strong>macOS Monterey:</strong> October 25, 2021</li><br/>
<li><strong>macOS Ventura:</strong> October 24, 2022</li></ul>Other updates expected to be released in September include iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, tvOS 17, and HomePod software version 17.<br/>
<br/>
There is no guarantee that Apple's past plans hint at the company's future plans, of course, so keep in mind that this is merely speculation. macOS Ventura had eleven beta versions and a Release Candidate before it was publicly released, while macOS Sonoma is only up to seven beta versions so far, so an October release cannot be ruled out. It is simply looking more likely that a September release could be in the cards in this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/macos-sonoma-release-timing/">Will macOS Sonoma Be Released in September This Year?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-macos-sonoma-be-released-in-september-this-year.2400615/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

There are no other changes to the earbuds, and they remain priced at &#36;169.99 in the United States.

Beats Studio Buds+ are essentially a sportier alternative to the AirPods Pro. Key features of the earbuds include up to 36 hours of battery life with the included USB-C charging case, and up to 1.6× as much active noise cancellation as the original Studio Buds.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 15 series at an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">event on Tuesday, September 12</a>, and camera upgrades across the devices will be the "star of the show," according to a report today from <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20230906-11830.html">Taiwanese research firm TrendForce</a>. The upgrades are said to be a "pivotal factor" that "could tip the scales for potential buyers." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Blue-Three-Quarters-Perspective-Camera-Closeup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909012" /><br/>
As previously rumored, TrendForce said both the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will be equipped with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/26/kuo-iphone-15-iphone-15-plus-feature-48mp-camera/">stacked camera sensor supplied by Sony</a>. Previous reports have indicated that this sensor will be able to capture more light, and the research firm said this will allow for improved dynamic range in photos.<br/>
<br/>
TrendForce also corroborated rumors that the iPhone 15 Pro Max will be equipped with a periscope telephoto lens that boosts the device's optical zoom capabilities. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said the lens will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/iphone-15-pro-max-5-6x-optical-zoom/">allow for up to 5x or 6x optical zoom</a>, compared to the current 3x limit on the iPhone 14 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Last, the research firm said all four iPhone 15 models will be equipped with a USB-C port <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/18/dynamic-island-all-iphone-15-models-rumor/">and the Dynamic Island</a>, as widely rumored. Replacing the notch on the iPhone 14 Pro models last year, the Dynamic Island surrounds the front camera and Face ID sensors, and it shows information such as system alerts and Live Activities.<br/>
<br/>
Additional features are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/iphone-15-pro-expected-next-week/">expected for the Pro models</a>, including a lighter-weight titanium frame, customizable Action button, A17 Bionic chip, Wi-Fi 6E support, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Safari browser, and iOS operating system have today formally been designated as "gatekeepers" in the European Union, an official classification that requires adherence to strict new regulations (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-06/eu-challenges-apple-microsoft-in-new-antitrust-push-to-rein-in-big-tech"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to curtail the power of major tech companies. Designated "gatekeeper" platforms will now face prohibition against favoring their own services over those of rivals. These platforms will also be prevented from combining personal data across different services and will have to allow users the option to download apps from alternative platforms. In a statement, Apple told <em>Bloomberg</em> "We remain very concerned about the privacy and data security risks the DMA poses for our users."<br/>
<br/>
While Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, Safari, and iOS have been officially classified as gatekeepers, iMessage currently remains exempt from the list. Apple has recently stated that the user base of its iMessage service in Europe <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/imessage-isnt-popular-enough-for-regulation/">may not be large enough</a> to warrant its inclusion under the DMA's regulations. The European Commission is in the process of investigating the validity of this claim, alongside Microsoft's Bing and Edge.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside Apple, the European Commission has also listed services from other technology firms including Alphabet's Google Search, Amazon's marketplace, and Bytedance's TikTok, bringing the total to 22 services that now fall under DMA's provisions.<br/>
<br/>
To be classified as a "gatekeeper" under the DMA, a company must fulfill certain criteria, including having sales across the EU of at least €7.5 billion, or a market capitalization of €75 billion or above. The designation also requires platforms or services to have more than 45 million monthly active users and over 10,000 active business users annually within the EU.<br/>
<br/>
Companies that do not adhere to the new regulations risk facing EU investigations, substantial fines, and the imposition of "behavioral or structural remedies." The fines can amount to 10 percent of a company's global turnover, with a 20 percent penalty for repeat violations.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">Apple&#039;s App Store, Safari, and iOS Officially Designated &#039;Gatekeepers&#039; in EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-app-store-safari-and-ios-officially-designated-gatekeepers-in-eu.2400592/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
