		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iconic "1984" commercial, which introduced the Macintosh computer to the world, aired 41 years ago today during Super Bowl XVIII.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/1984-ad.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-986454" /><br/>
Directed by Ridley Scott, the advertisement was designed to highlight the Macintosh as a groundbreaking computer that offers freedom and individuality in a market dominated by corporate conformity. It drew inspiration from George Orwell's dystopian novel <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, with Apple positioning itself as a liberator from the homogenized control represented by the fictional "Big Brother," a veiled allegory for IBM.<br/>
<br/>
The ad concludes with the voiceover stating, "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984.'"<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VtvjbmoDx-I?si=HNBaiCM2j_al0QKE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<br/>
Despite its eventual acclaim, the commercial faced skepticism within Apple. The board of directors expressed concerns about its unconventional approach, and John Sculley, Apple's CEO at the time, even attempted to sell the purchased Super Bowl ad slots.<br/>
<br/>
While the commercial aired nationally only once, the Macintosh reportedly achieved &#36;3.5 million in sales within months of its launch.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macintosh/">Macintosh</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/1984-commercial-aired-41-years-ago/">Apple&#039;s Famous &#039;1984&#039; Commercial Aired 41 Years Ago Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-famous-1984-commercial-aired-41-years-ago-today.2447893/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-miami-worldcenter-opens-friday-january-24-in-downtown-miami/">previewed</a> its all-new retail store <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/miamiworldcenter/">at the Miami Worldcenter</a> complex. The store opens this Friday, January 24 at 10 a.m. local time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-Miami-Worldcenter-Preview.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-986482" /><br/>
Apple says the store was designed with the environment in mind, and to connect customers with the natural world. The store's rooftop is outfitted with a green space that seamlessly blends with the surrounding palm trees and shrubs.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple Miami Worldcenter also features a biophilic design that helps connect customers to the beautiful green spaces surrounding the store," says Apple. "Upon entry, customers and the local community are welcomed by the grounds blooming with plants and flora inspired by the multicultural Latin American influence of Miami."<br/>
<br/>

The use of regionally-sourced materials helped to reduce the carbon footprint of the store's construction, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The store features a combined Genius Bar and Apple Pickup area for technical support and collection of online orders in one place.<br/>

There is also an Apple Vision Pro demo area.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta has announced that it's now possible to add WhatsApp to Accounts Center, the company's hub for managing how user information is used across its platforms. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/WhatsApp-Accounts-Center-Integration_Header.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-986446" /><br/>
The integration means that users can now adjust their settings from one place and share their status updates across Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. <br/>
<br/>
Meta says the option to link WhatsApp to Accounts Center is completely optional and disabled by default, and that WhatsApp messages and calls remain end-to-end encrypted regardless of whether users choose to add the app or not. From the company's <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/whatsapp-joins-accounts-center/">news blog</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Our approach for WhatsApp is simple: your account is separate from other apps and no one but you can change that. While adding your WhatsApp to Accounts Center is completely optional and off by default, it can help those who want features to work more seamlessly across apps. For example it’ll be easier to reshare updates from your WhatsApp Status to Facebook or Instagram Stories and show your friends what’s happening in your life without having to post multiple times. You’ll also be able to log back in to your WhatsApp account with a single sign-on, so you can get back into your accounts faster and with fewer steps.</blockquote>The WhatsApp integration into Accounts Center is being rolled out globally over the next few months. Once available, users will find the option in their WhatsApp settings or when cross-posting content across Meta's platforms, such as re-sharing a Status to one of its other apps. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/share-status-updates-instagram-facebook-whatsapp/">You Can Now Share Status Updates Across Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-now-share-status-updates-across-instagram-facebook-and-whatsapp.2447886/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Newly inaugurated US President Donald Trump on Tuesday expressed support for Elon Musk potentially acquiring TikTok, and also proposed a joint ownership structure with the U.S. government.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" /><br/>
"I would be, if he wanted to buy it, yes," Trump told reporters at a White House event announcing a new AI infrastructure <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/technology/trump-openai-stargate-artificial-intelligence.html">private sector partnership</a>, where OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son were in attendance. The comments came just days after TikTok <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/19/tiktok-is-working-again/">briefly went offline</a> in the United States following Supreme Court action.<br/>
<br/>
The social media platform, which boasts 170 million American users, temporarily shut down for about 12 hours on Saturday after the Supreme Court upheld <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-january-19-ban-imminent/">legislation</a> requiring Chinese company ByteDance to divest its US TikTok operations. Trump subsequently issued an executive order providing a 75-day pause on the ban's enforcement.<br/>
<br/>
During the White House event, where Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison was also present, Trump floated the idea of a 50-50 ownership split between any acquiring company and the US government. "They'll have something that's actually more valuable because they have the ultimate partner," Trump explained.<br/>
<br/>
Trump specifically mentioned both Musk and Ellison as potential buyers during the event. Oracle already plays a significant role in TikTok's operations, hosting most of the platform's servers.<br/>
<br/>
Trump originally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/15/tiktok-90-days/">supported banning</a> the short-form video app over national security concerns, but his thinking has U-turned since winning the US presidential election for a second time. "We won the young vote. I think I won it through TikTok," Trump told reporters. "So I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/trump-backs-elon-musk-possible-tiktok-buyer/">Trump Backs Elon Musk as Possible TikTok Buyer, Suggests Government Stake</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/trump-backs-elon-musk-as-possible-tiktok-buyer-suggests-government-stake.2447885/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular caller ID app <a href="https://www.truecaller.com/">Truecaller</a> is rolling out an update that brings real-time caller ID support to its iOS subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/truecaller.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-986427" /><br/>
Apple introduced Live Caller ID Lookup in iOS 18, allowing third-party caller ID apps to securely retrieve information about a caller from their servers, hence today's Truecaller update.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone users can enable the Live Caller ID Lookup feature by going to Settings ➝ Apps ➝ Phone, and selecting Call Blocking & Identification. Here, users should enable all Truecaller switches and open the Truecaller app again.<br/>
<br/>
Truecaller told <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/truecaller-brings-real-time-caller-id-to-iphone-users/">TechCrunch</a></em> it built a new server architecture to enable the new feature, and created a separate, encrypted database for iOS, alongside its existing larger database for Android users:<br/>
<blockquote>Apple's Phone app makes encrypted requests to this database and gets encrypted responses that are only decrypted on the client (iPhone) to show the caller ID in real time. This process is called "homomorphic encryption," as the computations use encrypted data instead of decrypting them first, while decryption happens on the client to display caller information if it matches with the data stored on the server.</blockquote>Truecaller has around 750,000 iPhone-using subscribers out of around 2.6 million subscribers in total, where the majority are Android users. However, 40% of Truecaller’s revenue is from iOS subscriptions, thanks to a 5x conversation rate to its premium tier on iOS compared to Android, and 80% higher revenue from iPhone subscribers. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to the new feature support, Truecaller has updated its interface, with the caller's name appearing in bold over their number. The latest version also includes automatic blocking of spam calls, while other improvements include the ability to search for previously identified calls, going as far back as 2,000 previous numbers in the Recents list in the Phone app.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to iOS 18, Truecaller had to rely on a locally saved dictionary of limited phone numbers on iOS. The Android app has offered real-time caller information for some time, so the latest iOS update is bringing feature parity across platforms.  Truecaller says it is now working on support for images to show up in the caller ID for its iOS users.<br/>
<br/>
Truecaller's premium tier for iOS users starts at &#36;9.99 a month per person, or &#36;74.99/year. The company also has a family plan on iOS starting at &#36;14.99/month or &#36;99.99/year and the highest tier Gold subscription at &#36;249 a year.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/truecaller-ios-update-real-time-caller-id-support/">Truecaller iOS Update Rolls Out Real-Time Caller ID Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/truecaller-ios-update-rolls-out-real-time-caller-id-support.2447880/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is closing in on an investment plan deal with Indonesian authorities that would allow it to resume iPhone 16 sales in the country, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/apple-close-to-deal-to-lift-indonesian-iphone-ban-minister-says">Bloomberg</a></em> reported on Wednesday.<br/>

Indonesia banned sales of the device in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/indonesia-bans-iphone-16-sales/">October</a>, claiming Apple had failed to comply with local manufacturing requirements of 35% domestic content for smartphones and tablets. Apple has offered a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-raises-indonesia-investment-offer-iphone-ban/">&#36;1 billion</a> investment in the country that includes building an AirTag factory. The offer is a significant increase from its previous offers of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/indonesia-iphone-ban-apple-10m-investment/">&#36;10 million</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ups-invest-offer-indonesia-iphone-16-ban/">&#36;100 million</a>, which were rejected by the government.<br/>
<br/>
“I strongly believe it will resolve very, very soon,” the country's investment minister Rosan Roeslani said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Davos on Tuesday. "Hopefully within one or two weeks this issue can be resolved."<br/>
<br/>
"The way they calculate it is different I think," he said, referring to the local content requirement. "Now they find a solution on that one, so hopefully they accept the discrepancies so we can have the iPhone 16 sold in Indonesia."<br/>
<br/>
Indonesia represents a significant market for Apple, with the country's population of 280 million operating some 354 million active mobile phones. The company has maintained developer academies there since 2018, but the country currently hosts no Apple manufacturing facilities. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/">Indonesia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/apple-deal-to-lift-iphone-16-ban-indonesia/">Apple Reportedly Close to a Deal to Lift iPhone 16 Ban in Indonesia</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-close-to-a-deal-to-lift-iphone-16-ban-in-indonesia.2447878/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple provided developers and public beta testers with the release candidate version of iOS 18.3 today, and with it comes release notes confirming what's new. While we knew about several of the features that are in the update, there are some lesser known tweaks and bug fixes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-18.3-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-986493" /><br/>

- Fixes an issue where the keyboard might disappear when initiating a typed Siri request<br/>

<br/>
We are expecting iOS 18.3 to see a launch alongside iPadOS 18.3, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.3, tvOS 18.3, visionOS 2.3, and watchOS 11.3 next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/ios-18-3-release-notes/">Here Are Apple&#039;s Full Release Notes for iOS 18.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-apples-full-release-notes-for-ios-18-3.2447858/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 18.3 Tweaks Calculator App Functionality</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 18.3, Apple made a small but meaningful change to the way the Calculator app works, reintroducing repeating operations. When you tap the equals sign twice, the app will now repeat the last mathematical operation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Calculator-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960038" /><br/>
So, for example, if you type in 5x5 and tap the equals sign, you'll get 25 as a result. If you hit the equals sign again, it will multiply 25x5, and will continue multiplying by 5 every time you tap the equals symbol.<br/>
<br/>
Repeating operations were an option in the Calculator app prior to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, but &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; removed the functionality. Users who have missed the feature will get it back after updating to iOS 18.3. Being able to repeat operations is useful for calculating compound interest. <br/>
<br/>
Note that this feature has also been missing in macOS 15, but the macOS 15.3 update reinstates it. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/ios-18-3-calculator-app/">iOS 18.3 Tweaks Calculator App Functionality</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-3-tweaks-calculator-app-functionality.2447854/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix is raising its prices for all plans in several countries, including the United States, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina. The cheapest Standard with ads plan will be &#36;1 more expensive in the U.S., going from &#36;6.99 to &#36;7.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884793" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-3.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" /><br/>
The Standard plan's price will increase from &#36;15.49 to &#36;17.99 per month, and the Premium plan will now cost &#36;24.99 per month, up from &#36;22.99 per month. The Standard plan offers 1080p HD video, and the Premium plan is the only plan that supports 4K streaming.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix last increased prices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/netflix-price-increase-2023/">in October 2023</a>, and this is the first price increase the ad-supported plan has seen since its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/04/netflix-basic-with-ads-plan-doesnt-work-apple-tv/">late 2022 launch</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The price hikes were announced during Netflix's Q4 2024 earnings results [<a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">PDF</a>], which saw the company report 19 million new subscribers, a quarterly record, and 16 percent revenue growth. Netflix now has over 300 million paying subscribers worldwide, and the company forecasts continued growth in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
On the price increase, Netflix said the following: "As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members, we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/netflix-2025-price-increase/">Netflix Increases Prices Again</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-increases-prices-again.2447848/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The UK government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-driving-licence-coming-this-year">today announced plans</a> for a digital wallet that will house digital driver's licenses. It is not yet clear if the digital wallet that the UK government has planned will integrate with Apple Wallet, but UK users will be able to access their driver's licenses through a GOV.UK app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> when the initiative launches.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/uk-wallet-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-986385" /><br/>
The digital driver's license will allow users to prove their age when purchasing age-restricted items, and it will serve as proof of the right to drive. Personal information will be protected with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> for security even if a device is lost.<br/>
<br/>
Along with driver's licenses, the UK digital wallet will eventually include veteran cards, DBS checks, and other documents issued by the government, but traditional physical documents will also remain available.<br/>
<br/>
The UK digital wallet app is launching alongside a GOV.UK app that will feature a built-in "GOV.UK Chat" chatbot that is being created in partnership with OpenAI, and the chat service is already being tested. The chatbot will let UK residents make payments and receive notifications and reminders about government services.<br/>
<br/>
In the United States, Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/13/iphone-drivers-license-support-illinois/">partnered with several states</a> to bring digital driver's licenses and ID cards to the Wallet app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch. Digital IDs are available in nine states, as well as Puerto Rico. At least six additional states have pledged future support for the functionality.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/uk-digital-wallet/">UK Announces Digital Wallet for IDs and Driver&#039;s Licenses</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-announces-digital-wallet-for-ids-and-drivers-licenses.2447847/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A leaker known as "Majin Bu" today <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1881695823618301990">shared an alleged image</a> of a component for the rumored, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/iphone-17-air-mockups/">ultra-thin "iPhone 17 Air" model</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iPhone-17-Air-Size-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985933" /><br/>
The blurry, pixelated image shows a pair of rear iPhone shells with a pill-shaped, raised camera bar along the top. On the left side of the bar, there is a circular cutout that appears to be for a single rear camera. On the right side of the bar, there appears to be an LED camera flash and a tiny microphone hole. The ultra-thin "iPhone 17 Air" is the only iPhone 17 model that is expected to have a single rear camera, so the shell could be for that device.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/19/iphone-se-4-launch-timeframe-revealed/">fourth-generation iPhone SE</a> is also expected to have a single rear camera, but an elongated camera ridge has not been rumored for that device.<br/>
<br/>
In the world of AI-generated photos, and counterfeit iPhones, we do not know if this image shows the actual "iPhone 17 Air." Sometimes leaks like these end up being real, but in many cases they end up being fake. Skepticism is warranted.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">iPhone 17, the design seems confirmed. <a href="https://t.co/5Wh6alUiMr">pic.twitter.com/5Wh6alUiMr</a></p>&mdash; Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1881695823618301990?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Majin Bu accurately <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-16-pro-two-new-color-options/">revealed the "Desert Titanium" color name</a> for iPhone 16 Pro models seven months before the devices launched, but some of his information has been wrong, including a rumor about an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/leaker-claims-low-cost-ipad-launching-tomorrow/">iPad 11 being imminent in 2023</a>.<br/>
<br/>
An elongated camera bump has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">rumored for both the "iPhone 17 Air"</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/">iPhone 17 Pro models</a>, so perhaps this alleged design change will be coming to the entire iPhone 17 lineup. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17, the "iPhone 17 Air," the iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max in September.<br/>
<br/>
There are already some Android phones with a camera bar, such as Google's Pixel 9.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the "iPhone 17 Air" will measure <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">just 5.5mm at its thinnest point</a>, which would make it the thinnest iPhone ever. Apple does not include the rear camera bump in its iPhone dimensions.<br/>
<br/>
Due to its ultra-thin design, the "iPhone 17 Air" is expected to have limited specs, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/">only a single rear camera</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">a single speaker</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">no SIM card slot worldwide</a>, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">A19 chip</a> instead of the more powerful A19 Pro chip. Of course, the device will also be equipped with a smaller battery than other iPhone 17 models due to size constraints.<br/>
<br/>
Other rumored features include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">6.6-inch OLED display</a> with a Dynamic Island, Face ID, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/">8GB of RAM for Apple Intelligence support</a>, and more.<br/>

With the RC, Apple provided the release notes for &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.3, so if you want to know exactly what's coming, here are the details.<br/>
<blockquote>This update introduces Genmoji, powered by Apple Intelligence, and also includes other enhancements, bug fixes, and security updates for your Mac.<br/>

- Calculator repeats the last mathematical operation when you click the equals sign again<br/>
- Easily manage settings for notification summaries from the Lock Screen (Mac with Apple silicon)<br/>

With the exception of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, a feature that was already available in iOS and iPadOS, these release notes also pertain to iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[When installing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.3, iOS 18.3, or iPadOS 18.3, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> will be turned on automatically on compatible devices, Apple says in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_3-release-notes">developer release notes</a> for the updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963424" /><br/>
<blockquote>For users new or upgrading to iOS 18.3, Apple Intelligence will be enabled automatically during iPhone onboarding. Users will have access to Apple Intelligence features after setting up their devices. To disable Apple Intelligence, users will need to navigate to the Apple Intelligence & Siri Settings pane and turn off the Apple Intelligence toggle. This will disable Apple Intelligence features on their device</blockquote>With &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.2, iOS 18.1, and iOS 18.2, &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; was opt-in rather than opt-out, and users who wanted the feature needed to turn it on in the Settings app. Going forward, it will be enabled by default, and Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users who do not want to use the feature will need to turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.3 also brings <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a> to the Mac for the first time, so Mac users will be able to create custom emoji characters after installing the update. All three new software updates add tweaks to the Notification summaries feature to make it more clear when a notification contains AI-generated information.<br/>
<br/>
Apple provided developers and public beta testers with the release candidate versions of iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.3 today, which means the software updates will see a release in the near future. We are expecting the updates to launch to the public next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/macos-sequoia-15-3-apple-intelligence-opt-out/">macOS Sequoia 15.3 and iOS 18.3 Enable Apple Intelligence Automatically</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-15-3-and-ios-18-3-enable-apple-intelligence-automatically.2447837/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the iOS 18.3 update, Apple is adding new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a> features for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. After installing the software, &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; users will be able to add an event to the Calendar app when using the Camera Control &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; option to view a poster or a flyer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Visual-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982217" /><br/>
Using &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; to add an event to Calendar was a promised function that Apple showed off when introducing Camera Control, and it will be usable in iOS 18.3. To add an event, view a document such as a poster with a date, and then tap on the date when the feature pops up in the &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; interface. <br/>
<br/>
The update also adds a feature for easily identifying plants and animals with &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj;. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app is already able to provide insight into plants, animals, and insects when opting to view additional information in the editing interface, but Camera Control will now show these details in real-time.<br/>
<br/>
When viewing an animal or a plant with &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj;, you may see a tappable bubble that lets you know what you're looking at. Tapping it provides more information. <br/>
<br/>

&zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> feature that is exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models. It can be activated by long pressing on the Camera Control button.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/ios-18-3-new-visual-intelligence-features/">iOS 18.3 Adds New Visual Intelligence Features for iPhone 16</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-3-adds-new-visual-intelligence-features-for-iphone-16.2447833/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

The betas are available to registered developers, and can be downloaded from the Settings app on each device.<br/>
<br/>
There were no notable new features found in the updates, but code suggests that Apple will add support for robot vacuums to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, which means it will be a supported category in the Home app in visionOS, tvOS, and watchOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/whats-new-in-tvos-18-3-so-far/">add a new notice</a> about digital movie and TV show sales in tvOS 18.3.<br/>
<br/>
We are expecting tvOS 18.3, watchOS 11.3, and visionOS 2.3 to be released sometime in late January alongside iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.3.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/apple-seeds-watchos-11-3-tvos-18-3-visionos-2-3-rcs/">Apple Seeds Release Candidate Versions of watchOS 11.3, tvOS 18.3 and visionOS 2.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-release-candidate-versions-of-watchos-11-3-tvos-18-3-and-visionos-2-3.2447831/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

Registered developers can opt-in to the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.3 brings <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a> to the Mac, a feature that was previously limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. With &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;, Mac users can create custom characters with a text-based prompt, similar to how <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a> works.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; characters behave just like emoji on devices running iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, ‌&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;‌ 15.1 and later, but on earlier versions of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and Android devices, &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; are sent as images. &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; can be added from the emoji interface, and image generation is done on-device.<br/>
<br/>
All macs with an Apple silicon chip support &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; and other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-15-3-rc/">Apple Seeds macOS Sequoia 15.3 Release Candidate to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-15-3-release-candidate-to-developers.2447829/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 can be downloaded from the Settings app on a compatible device by going to General > Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
With the update, Apple made several changes to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> Notification Summaries, such as removing news-related summaries temporarily.<br/>
<br/>
Additional &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> updates are coming later in iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 updates that will follow iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3.

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon this week has Apple's AirTag 4-Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;69.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00. Amazon introduced this all-time low price earlier in January, and it's been consistently available for most of the month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/airtag-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-889772" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
Amazon provides an estimated late January delivery date for most residences in the United States, and you won't need to clip an on-page coupon in order to see this deal. If you're shopping for just one AirTag, Amazon has the AirTag 1-Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CWXNS552%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;22.99</strong></a>, which is about &#36;3 higher compared to that option's record low price.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to release at least one new iPad Pro model this year, according to a supplier-focused report today from <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=32427">Korean website <em>The Elec</em></a>. It is likely that the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models would be updated simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipad-pro-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949477" /><br/>
After <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">receiving an OLED display last year</a>, the report said the iPad Pro will receive only "minor" changes this year. Overall, the next iPad Pro is expected to look "similar" to the current models, suggesting that the device will not receive any major design changes this year. All in all, expect a spec bump only for the next iPad Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
The report is focused on the possibility of South Korean company LX Semicon supplying display drivers for the new iPad Pro this year. It said that components for the device would go into mass production in April or May, suggesting that the next iPad Pro models are still many months away. A launch will likely occur later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said</a> Apple could have its next-generation M5 chip ready for the next iPad Pro by late 2025 or early 2026.<br/>
<br/>
The current iPad Pro models with OLED displays and the M4 chip launched in May 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Apple is expected to release new iPad Air and entry-level iPad 11 models. Those devices will likely launch by March or April. According to Gurman, the iPad 11 will be equipped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/ipad-11-rumored-specs/">with an A17 Pro chip and 8GB of RAM</a> for Apple Intelligence, while a recent leak indicated that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/20/new-ipad-air-models-with-m3-chip-leak/">new iPad Air models will have an M3 chip</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if the iPad mini will be updated this year, but it is typically only updated once every several years. After receiving the A17 Pro chip and more last year, the iPad mini might be the only iPad model that is not updated in 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/">The Elec</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/new-ipad-pro-this-year-report/">New iPad Pro Reportedly Launching This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pro-reportedly-launching-this-year.2447821/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
