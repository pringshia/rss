		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18.1 is the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> update with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> capabilities, and that's what a lot of the coverage about the new software has focused on. If you don't have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that's capable of &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, you're probably wondering just what's in the update for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iOS-18.1-Without-Apple-Intelligence-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972870" /><br/>
While &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; does make up the bulk of what's new, if you have an older device, you still get some solid improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Phone Call Recording</h2><br/>
In iOS 18.1, you can record any phone call that you're on, with the audio saved to the Notes app. The Notes app is able to automatically generate a transcript of the call, which you can search.<br/>
<br/>
To use call recording, just tap on the little voice wave icon in the upper left while on a call. You cannot record a call in secret - all participants are notified that a recording is in progress through an automated message.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-record-your-phone-calls/">How to Record and Transcribe Phone Calls</a></li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Your recorded phone calls are saved in the Notes app. You can play a call back in its entirety or get a transcript, as well as find specific spots in a call using the transcript. Transcripts are generated automatically and can be searched.<br/>
<br/>
You need an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 or later to use call recording, and that's also the minimum device requirement for the related feature for saving voice memos to the Notes app to get a transcript.<br/>
<br/>
Transcripts are available in English (U.S., Australia), Spanish (U.S., Mexico), Mandarin Chinese (China mainland), Cantonese (Hong Kong), and Korean (South Korea) right now.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods Features</h2><br/>
If you have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, you have access to all of the new Hearing Health features that are available in iOS 18.1. That includes a hearing test to check for hearing loss, as well as the option to use the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 as a hearing aid if you do end up finding mild to moderate hearing loss.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 can also be used to protect your hearing, listening for loud sounds around you like construction noise or shouting and minimizing them. It will work for sustained sounds louder than 110 decibels, but it's not meant for burst sounds like gunfire, fireworks, or jackhammers.<br/>
<br/>
As long as you have &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2, the latest &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 firmware (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/apple-releases-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7b19/">which is out now</a>) and a device that can run &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; (or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>) you can use the Hearing Test, Hearing Aid, and Hearing Protection capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Store Search</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> now supports natural language search, so it's easier to find exactly what you're looking for. Some of the possible searches now:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Fun new games to play</li><br/>
 	<li>Apps for learning new skills</li><br/>
 	<li>Apps to help with physics homework</li><br/>
 	<li>Games to compete with friends</li><br/>
 	<li>Cooking games for kids</li><br/>
 	<li>Best games in the world</li><br/>
 	<li>Apps with HealthKit integration</li><br/>
 	<li>Games with roguelike elements</li><br/>
 	<li>Games to play without Wi-Fi</li><br/>
 	<li>Apps to sell stuff</li><br/>
 	<li>Apps to watch movies for free</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Smaller New Features</h2><br/>
There are a few other minor feature tweaks that are worth knowing about.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Control Center</strong> - You can add standalone buttons for AirDrop and Satellite, plus there are Control Center controls for Measure and Level.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Apple Music</strong> - You can share <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> songs directly to TikTok.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Wallet</strong> - The Wallet app no longer shows your Savings account balance on the main <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> screen, and you need to tap into it to get that info.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2><br/>
Along with these features, there are a couple of bug fixes.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Podcasts</strong> - Unplayed Podcasts episodes should no longer be marked as played.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Photos</strong> - When you're scrubbing through a 4K 60fps video in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app, it will no longer stutter.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Car keys</strong> - If you had a problem where your digital car key would not start or unlock your vehicle with passive unlocking, the update should fix it.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>What to Look Forward to Next</h2><br/>
Apple is testing iOS 18.2 right now, and it once again focuses primarily on &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features. There are some non-AI changes to look forward to, though, like a whole new look for the Mail app with built-in categorization and a new interface for setting default apps to replace Apple's own apps.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/ios-18-1-no-apple-intelligence/">iOS 18.1: What You Get If You Don&#039;t Have an iPhone With Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-1-what-you-get-if-you-dont-have-an-iphone-with-apple-intelligence.2441200/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is launching a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> promotion for &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users, providing the option to earn up to five percent Daily Cash on purchases made from November 6, 2024 to April 30, 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/apple-card-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="1144" height="644" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-735877" /><br/>
To unlock the Daily Cash back promotion, users will need to spend between &#36;5,000 and &#36;15,000. At &#36;5,000, three percent Daily Cash is unlocked. Spending &#36;10,000 unlocks four percent Daily Cash, and spending &#36;15,000 unlocks five percent Daily Cash.<br/>
<br/>
You will need to spend at least &#36;5,000 to get the bonus, and it is not retroactive, so it will only apply to purchases made after you hit each spending limit.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the offer is limited to select &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users who receive a notification about it in the Wallet app. Those eligible who have &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; participants will see shared spending count toward the total.<br/>
<br/>
For &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; partner stores that already offer three percent cash back, there will be no additional Daily Cash increase until the four percent tier is reached. The Daily Cash bonus is available on up to &#36;50,000 in total purchases.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-card-promo-daily-cash-back/">Apple Card Users Can Get Up to 5% Daily Cash on All Purchases Through Holiday Season</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-users-can-get-up-to-5-daily-cash-on-all-purchases-through-holiday-season.2441195/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-pro">updated its website</a> to indicate that the Mac Pro now ships with a USB-C to USB-C charging cable in the box, instead of a USB-C to Lightning cable, and we have learned that the high-end desktop computer now comes with the new USB-C versions of the Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard accessories in the box as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Mac-Pro-Magic-Accessories.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973399" /><br/>
There are no other changes to the Mac Pro today beyond the Magic accessories and charging cable switching from Lightning to USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the current Mac Pro with the M2 Ultra chip in June 2023, with pricing starting at &#36;5,999 in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-usb-c-magic-accessories/">USB-C versions of the Magic Mouse, Magic Keyboard, and Magic Trackpad accessories</a> alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/">new iMac with the M4 chip</a> earlier today.

		<title>Lower-End Apple Silicon Macs With 10-Core M4 Chip to Fully Support Two External Displays</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In addition to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/">new iMac</a> with the 10-core M4 chip being the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/10-core-m4-imac-supports-8k-display-at-120hz/">first-ever Mac with support for up to an 8K external display at 120Hz</a>, the computer also supports up to two 6K external displays at 60Hz. That's a very notable upgrade, as lower-end Apple silicon Macs like the MacBook Air, entry-level MacBook Pro, and previous iMac models have mostly been limited to a single external display, at least on an official basis.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hero-banner-displays.jpg" alt="" width="1723" height="969" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930094" /><br/>
Two exceptions are the MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 chip, which support up to two external displays, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/macos-sonoma-14-6-dual-display-support/">only when the laptop's lid is closed</a>. Another exception is the Mac mini, which has an HDMI port for connecting a second display. DisplayLink adapters have also been a viable solution for multiple external displays ever since the first Apple silicon Macs with the M1 chip launched in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
But the 10-core M4 chip is notable in that it will bring proper support for two external displays to more lower-end Macs for the first time since Apple silicon launched, without any special tricks required. No more DisplayLink adapters, and no needing to have the MacBook's lid closed. That's a significant, long-awaited advancement for Apple silicon.<br/>
<br/>
Higher-end Apple silicon Macs have supported multiple external displays since the MacBook Pro models with M1 Pro and M1 Max chips launched in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-promises-two-more-mac-announcements/">expected to announce</a> a new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the 10-core M4 chip this week, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/macbook-pro-m4-two-external-displays/">alleged leak</a> already confirmed that the laptop will support two external displays with the lid open. Next year, the M4 chip should expand to the MacBook Air, and 10-core configurations should likewise support two external displays.<br/>
<br/>
The new iMac is available to pre-order now, and it launches on Friday, November 8.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/m4-chip-two-external-displays/">Lower-End Apple Silicon Macs With 10-Core M4 Chip to Fully Support Two External Displays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lower-end-apple-silicon-macs-with-10-core-m4-chip-to-fully-support-two-external-displays.2441190/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Intelligence is what Apple is calling its artificial intelligence feature set, previewed at WWDC in June 2024. The first Apple Intelligence features launched with iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1, but this is only an initial taste of what Apple has planned.<br/>
<br/>

There are a selection of Apple Intelligence features that are available now, along with additional capabilities that will be rolling out across the rest of 2024 and 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_features_available_now">Apple Intelligence Features Available Now</h2><br/>
<h3 id="writing_tools">Writing Tools</h3><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960221" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-writing-tools.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Proofread text checks for spelling and grammar errors, including word choice and sentence structure. You can accept all suggestions with a tap or go through them one by one with explanations.</li><br/>
 <li>Rewrite cleans up what you've written and shifts the tone without impacting your content. Options include Friendly, Professional, and Concise.</li><br/>
 <li>You can select text and get a summary of it with Apple Intelligence. You can choose to create a paragraph, pull out key points, make a list, or create a table. Summaries are available in Mail, Messages, and more.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You can select any text on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac and use Apple Intelligence to access Writing Tools for summaries and other features.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="siri">Siri</h3><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960222" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>There's a new glow around the edges of the display when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is activated, applicable to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>. On Mac, the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; window can be placed anywhere. The glow animates responsively to the sound of your voice so you can tell when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is listening without interrupting other things you're doing.</li><br/>
 <li>A double tap at the bottom of the display brings up the Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interface so you can type requests instead of speaking them. On Mac, you need to press the Command key twice to bring up Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; includes suggested requests so you can get your questions answered faster.</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can maintain context between requests so you can ask a question and then reference it in a second reply. If you ask about the temperature in Raleigh, for example, and then follow up with "what's the humidity?" &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; should know you mean in Raleigh.</li><br/>
 <li>If you stumble over your words when speaking to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, or change what you're saying mid-sentence, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will follow along.</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has Apple's product knowledge and support base for answering questions about your device's features and settings, and can even find settings when you don't know the exact name by using natural language search.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3 id="mail">Mail</h3><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960207" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-smart-replies.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>There is a summarize button for summarizing any of your incoming emails, plus you will see a brief summary of an email in your inbox list rather than the first few lines of the email.</li><br/>
 <li>Mail surfaces time sensitive messages first when applicable, putting them at the top of your inbox so you see what's important right away.</li><br/>
 <li>Smart Reply provides quick-tap responses to emails that you've been sent, with contextual options based on what's in the email.</li><br/>
 <li>Multiple notifications from Mail will be summarized on your Lock Screen so you can see what's in an email without opening the app.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3 id="messages">Messages</h3><br/>

 <li>Messages has Smart Reply options for incoming texts, which analyze the content of messages to offer suggestions of what you might want to say.</li><br/>
 <li>Multiple Messages notifications are summarized on your Lock Screen.</li><br/>
 <li>You can use all of the Writing Tools features in the Messages app for proofreading and refining what you're planning to send.</li><br/>

<ul><br/>
 <li>You can create a Memory Movie with just a description, such as "My cat in 2024," or "Orlando in the summer." The feature automatically picks relevant photos and chooses songs, but you can tweak through the Memory Mixes feature or choose a mood to guide the direction of the audio. You can also add in specific scenes and images you want to see throughout the memory when you're creating the prompt.</li><br/>
 <li>Natural language search is available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, so you can just describe what you're looking for, such as "Eric rollerskating while wearing green."</li><br/>
 <li>Search can also find specific moments in video clips.</li><br/>
 <li>Search offers up smart complete suggestions for narrowing down what you might want to find.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h4>Clean Up</h4><br/>
The &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app also includes "Clean Up," a feature that lets you remove unwanted objects from your photos. The Clean Up tool in the ‌&zwnj;Photos&zwnj;‌ app is able to automatically detect objects in an image that might not be wanted, but you can also tap, circle, or brush over an unwanted object to remove it.<br/>
<br/>
Zooming in on an image can help with using a finger as a brush to remove smaller blemishes and issues with an image, and it is intelligent enough not to remove part of a person even if a person or main subject is selected.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962933" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Photos-Clean-Up-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Clean Up works on all images in the ‌&zwnj;Photos&zwnj;‌ library, including older images and images captured by other devices like a point and shoot camera or a DSLR.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="transcription_summaries">Transcription Summaries</h3><br/>
In Notes and other apps, you can record audio and get a transcript along with a summary of your transcript, which is useful for recording lectures and other audio. Transcription isn't an Apple Intelligence feature, but summaries are.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="focus_modes">Focus Modes</h3><br/>
There is a dedicated Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode that only shows you important notifications that need attention while filtering out everything else.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960224" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-focus-mode-changes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
When customizing an existing Focus mode or creating a new one, there is a new toggle to turn on Intelligent Breakthrough and Silencing. This option allows important notifications to interrupt you, while muting notifications that are not important, which is the same thing that the Reduce Notifications Focus does. You can override the notification settings for specific apps and people, which is how it worked prior to iOS 18.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960225" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-focus-reduce-interruptions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="notification_summaries">Notification Summaries</h3><br/>
Your incoming notifications are summarized so you can see what's new for each app at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968372" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ios-18-apple-intelligence-notification-summary.jpg" alt="notifications" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="phone">Phone</h3><br/>
Summaries of transcriptions generated from your phone calls are supported in iOS 18.1. The iOS 18.1 update adds the option to record a phone call and get a transcription, which is not an Apple Intelligence feature. What does require Apple Intelligence, though, is getting a summary from that transcription without reading through the entire thing.<br/>
<br/>
Note that you can start a recording by tapping on the record button in the upper left corner of the display when on a phone call. All participants are notified that the call is being recorded before the recording starts.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" alt="" width="5416" height="3047" /><br/>
Recorded phone calls are stored in the Notes app, where you can tap in to view a transcript and get a summary generated from that transcript.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="safari">Safari</h3><br/>
When reading an article in Reader Mode, there is an option to have Apple Intelligence summarize the article for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960226" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-safari-summarize.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_features_coming_in_ios_18.2">Apple Intelligence Features Coming in iOS 18.2</h2><br/>
The next set of Apple Intelligence features will come in iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.2, and this is when Apple plans to release <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, Genmoji, and ChatGPT &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; integration. These features are being beta tested right now. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has a waitlist for &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, Genmoji, and Image Wand, and these features will be rolling out to developers over the coming weeks so that Apple can collect feedback and make improvements to the image generation capabilities before a public launch later this year. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="image_playground">Image Playground</h3><br/>
&zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; can be used to generate images in cartoon-like styles using a text-based prompt. Apple has built-in suggestions and concepts that you can choose from, like costumes, locations, items, and themes. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-image-playground-crocodile.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972927" /><br/>
While &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; is a standalone app, it is also integrated into the Messages and Notes app. In these apps, Apple can use context from what you've typed for image generation suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
For inspiration, you can upload or take a photo, and then get a cartoon AI version of it, and you can also use images of friends and family members pulled from the People album in the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
You can start with a base suggestion or photo and then continue to add to it until you get what you want. You can remove suggestions at any time, and save your favorite creations for use in other apps. Anytime you create something with &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, you'll get multiple options so you can choose the best one.<br/>
<br/>
There are only Animation and Illustration styles for &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, so there is no option for creating photorealistic images. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="image_wand">Image Wand</h3><br/>
Image Wand is basically the same thing as &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, but in the Notes app. When you have notes that you've taken, you can circle an empty spot or some text and Image Wand will add a contextually relevant image. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-intelligence-image-wand.jpg" alt="" width="1640" height="995" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962313" /><br/>
So if you have notes on photosynthesis, you can add in an image of a plant under the sun. Image Wand isn't able to generate complex images, so if you want a picture of the internal structure of mitochondria, you're out of luck, but it can make a stylized image featuring the organelle. <br/>
<br/>
On an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, you can draw a rough sketch of what you want to add to your notes with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, and then use Image Wand to generate something more polished.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="genmoji">Genmoji</h3><br/>
Genmoji are custom emoji characters that you can create using a text-based description. If there's an emoji you can't find but need, like a duck eating a sandwich or an alligator skateboarding, Genmoji can make it for you. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-genmoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960703" /><br/>
Genmoji aren't too far off from &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; images, but the generation system tends to want to add a person for a lot of requests. You can choose yourself or a friend or family member, or just use a generic emoji character as your base. <br/>
<br/>
In Messages and other apps, Genmoji behave like emoji, but they're not going to display properly for anyone running an operating system earlier than iOS 18.1, or on an Android device. In iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2, they work like emoji, but Genmoji are displayed as a blank box and an accompanying full-size image on other versions of iOS.<br/>
<br/>
If you have iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2 and someone sends a Genmoji, you can long press on it and tap the "Emoji Details" button to see what prompt was used to create it, plus you can add it to your own Genmoji/sticker collection to use.<br/>
<br/>
To create a Genmoji character, tap into the Emoji keyboard and tap on the Emoji with a "+" button next to the search bar. From there, you can type in your idea.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="siri_chatgpt_integration">Siri ChatGPT Integration</h3><br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; ChatGPT integration lets &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; hand requests over to OpenAI's ChatGPT. ChatGPT is off by default, but you can turn it on in the Apple Intelligence and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; section of the Settings app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg" alt="" width="1825" height="1027" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960667" /><br/>
If ChatGPT integration is enabled, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will consult ChatGPT for complex requests. Complex requests might include creating an image, generating text from scratch, making recipe ideas based on what's in your refrigerator, describing what's in a photo, and more. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will analyze each request to see if it's something that needs to be answered by ChatGPT, but you can also automatically invoke ChatGPT for a request by using a request like "Ask ChatGPT to give me a chocolate chip cookie recipe." <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will ask your permission before querying ChatGPT, but there is an option to turn off that extra permission step by toggling off "Confirm ChatGPT Requests" in the ChatGPT section of Settings. <br/>
<br/>
You don't need an account to use ChatGPT, and it is free, but if you have a paid account, you can sign in. If you're not signed in, OpenAI does not store any of your ChatGPT requests, nor is your information used for training ChatGPT. If you sign in, ChatGPT can save a copy of your queries. Apple does not store ChatGPT queries. <br/>
<br/>
ChatGPT can be used with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, but it is also integrated into Writing Tools and Visual Intelligence. With Writing Tools, ChatGPT can generate text, and with Visual Intelligence, ChatGPT can answer questions about what the Camera sees. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="visual_intelligence">Visual Intelligence</h3><br/>
Visual Intelligence is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> feature that uses the Camera Control button. If you long press it, you can get into Visual Intelligence mode, where the Camera app can be used to identify what's around you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Visual-Intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970984" /><br/>
If you point the camera at a store, for example, you can see ratings, hours, and other information. If you take a photo of an object, you can get more information about the object from ChatGPT, or use it with Google Search to find similar images. The Google Search feature is a good way to search for products that you want to find.<br/>
<br/>
Other Visual Intelligence features include reading text out loud, detecting phone numbers and addresses to add them to the Contacts app, copying text, and summarizing long passages of text. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="writing_tools">Writing Tools</h3><br/>
Writing Tools is in iOS 18.1, but in iOS 18.2, you can make more open-ended changes to what you've written. You can come up with your own tone changes, so if you want something to be more flowery or elaborate, Writing Tools can make it happen. You can also ask for your text to be converted into a different format, like a poem.<br/>
<br/>
Writing Tools also has ChatGPT integration in iOS 18.2 so if you want to generate text from scratch, you can do so with ChatGPT.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="additional_languages">Additional Languages</h3><br/>
In iOS 18.2, Apple Intelligence supports localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and the UK in addition to U.S. English.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_features_coming_later">Apple Intelligence Features Coming Later</h2><br/>
There are additional Apple Intelligence features that will be coming in updates to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> in 2025. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="priority_notifications">Priority Notifications</h3><br/>
Priority notifications will show up at the top of your notification stack, so you can get to what's most important first.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="siri">Siri</h3><br/>
Some initial &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; updates are available in iOS 18.1, such as &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s new glow that encompasses the edges of the display, and ChatGPT integration is coming in iOS 18.2, but we'll need to wait for iOS 18.3 and iOS 18.4 for additional &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities. Apple is working on onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability to take more actions in and across apps.<br/>
<br/>
Onscreen awareness will let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; take actions when you ask something about what's on your display. If you're looking at a photo and want to message it to your friend Eric, you'll be able to tell &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to "Send this picture to Eric," and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will understand and do it.<br/>
<br/>
Personal context will let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; do more with your personal data like emails and messages. This is an on-device feature, and it will let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; learn more about you, who you're communicating with, and how you use your device. Personal context will let you do things like ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to find a specific message, or remind you when you took a photo that you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; option to take more actions in and across apps will drastically improve what &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is capable of. You'll be able to move files from one app to another and control app functions with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that you never could before. It'll work in third-party apps as well as Apple's own apps.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="macos_features">macOS Features</h3><br/>
Memory Maker is in iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, but not &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1. Genmoji is in iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2, but not &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.2.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to release Memory Maker and Genmoji for &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; at a later time. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="when_to_expect_more_apple_intelligence_features">When to Expect More Apple Intelligence Features</h2><br/>
More Apple Intelligence features will come in iOS 18.2, iOS 18.3, and iOS 18.4.<br/>
<br/>
We'll get iOS 18.2 in December, likely around the middle of the month. Apple is already testing iOS 18.2 with developers. <br/>
<br/>
In late January or so, we'll get iOS 18.3, which could potentially have some new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4, which isn't expected until around March 2025, will have the bulk of the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Apple Intelligence features. We're also expecting to see Apple roll out support for additional languages in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_device_requirements">Apple Intelligence Device Requirements</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence requires a device with one of Apple's newest chips and 8GB RAM. Eligible models are listed below.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>All &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max</li><br/>
 <li>All Apple silicon iPads</li><br/>
<li>A17 Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></li><br/>
 <li>All Apple silicon Macs</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_waitlist">Apple Intelligence Waitlist</h2><br/>
When you first install iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1, you have to go to the Settings app and join the Apple Intelligence waitlist. Apple uses a waitlist mechanic to ensure that behind the scenes downloads go smoothly and that the system isn't overloaded.<br/>
<br/>
While on the waitlist, Apple devices download necessary files for on-device processing, and the waitlist should only take a few hours at most. The waitlist is on a per-account basis, so you only need to sign up for it on one device to have access on multiple devices.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, Genmoji, and Image Wand in iOS 18.2 require a second waitlist, but that's only relevant if you're running the iOS 18.2 developer beta. If you are, note that Apple is rolling out access to these features over the coming weeks. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_settings">Apple Intelligence Settings</h2><br/>
In the Privacy and Security section of the Settings app you can access an Apple Intelligence Report that lets you export your Apple Intelligence data as part of Apple's promise for transparency around Apple Intelligence. Biometric authentication is required to access and export Apple Intelligence data.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960227" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-report.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
You can also disable Apple Intelligence by toggling off the setting under the Apple Intelligence and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; section in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_availability">Apple Intelligence Availability</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence is only available in U.S. English at this time, and it is not available to in the European Union (&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;) or China. Device region and language need to be set to the United States.<br/>
<br/>
In iOS 18.2, localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK is supported in addition to U.S. English. <br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to add support for additional languages in 2025, like Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese. Apple Intelligence will launch on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in the European Union in April 2025. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Everything You Need to Know About Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apple-intelligence.2441182/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When configured with a 10-core M4 chip, the new iMac announced today <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/specs/">supports up to an 8K external display at 120Hz</a>, or up to two 6K displays at 60Hz each. The impressive feat was <a href="https://x.com/VadimYuryev/status/1850929080281321899">noted by Vadim Yuryev</a>, co-host of the YouTube channel Max Tech.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iMac-M4-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973341" /><br/>
This means the latest iMac is the first-ever Mac to support an 8K display at 120Hz, beating out higher-end models like the MacBook Pro, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro. Apple is expected to announce new MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-promises-two-more-mac-announcements/">as early as tomorrow</a>, however, so support for an 8K display at 120Hz could be expanded soon.<br/>
<br/>
Apple doesn't even offer an 8K display with a 120Hz refresh rate — at least not yet. Apple's higher-end Pro Display XDR monitor has a 6K resolution at 60Hz, while its lower-end Studio Display monitor has a 5K resolution at 60Hz.<br/>
<br/>
Does the iMac's external display support hint at future 120Hz versions of the Pro Display XDR or Studio Display? There are no concrete rumors yet.<br/>
<br/>
The previous iMac with the M3 chip supports one external display at up to 6K/60Hz, and this remains true for the latest base model with the 8-core M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
For more details about the new iMac, read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/">earlier coverage of Apple's announcement</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., pricing for the iMac with a 10-core M4 chip starts at &#36;1,499.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/10-core-m4-imac-supports-8k-display-at-120hz/">iMac With 10-Core M4 Chip is First Mac to Support 8K Display at 120Hz</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/imac-with-10-core-m4-chip-is-first-mac-to-support-8k-display-at-120hz.2441180/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2 updates that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-releases-ios-18-2/">started testing last week</a> are set to be released to the public this December, Apple said today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-intelligence-is-available-today-on-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">in a newsroom article</a> highlighting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Generic-iOS-18.2-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972123" /><br/>
"New &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features will be available in December," reads Apple's article. The update will add the first image generation features, including Genmoji, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, and Image Wand, plus it includes ChatGPT integration with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and new, more flexible Writing Tools options. For <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> users, the iOS 18.2 update adds visual intelligence, which uses Camera Control to identify and provide additional information about objects and places.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2 will also see &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; gain support for localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and the UK in addition to U.S. English.<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, iOS 18.2 and its sister updates are available to developers for testing, but Apple will likely make a public beta available at some point. A December release gives Apple approximately a month and a half to test the new feature set, depending on the planned release date.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's .2 updates are typically released in December during the same general timeframe, so if Apple sticks to that, we could see a launch on December 9th or 10th, well ahead of the holiday period.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>iOS 17.2: December 11</li><br/>
 	<li>iOS 16.2: December 13</li><br/>
 	<li>iOS 15.2: December 13</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
After iOS 18.2, Apple will start testing iOS 18.3. That update is likely to come out at some point in January or February, and it will be followed by iOS 18.4 in April.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said today that it plans to bring &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> in the European Union in April, plus we are awaiting other &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features like Priority Notifications, and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that include onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability to take new actions in and across apps.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who install iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, or &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 on a device capable of supporting &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; can try out Writing Tools, Smart Replies summaries, and other &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features as of today.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-confirms-ios-18-2-december-launch/">Apple Confirms iOS 18.2 With Image Playground, Genmoji and Siri ChatGPT Integration Will Launch in December</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-ios-18-2-with-image-playground-genmoji-and-siri-chatgpt-integration-will-launch-in-december.2441174/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/">introduced a new iMac today</a> with the M4 chip and more, but that's not all, as it still has two more Mac announcements planned this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/apple-oct-2024-mac-tease.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972620" /><br/>
"This is a huge week for the Mac, and this morning, we begin a series of three exciting new product announcements that will take place over the coming days," said Apple's hardware engineering chief John Ternus, in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-m4-imac-keynote/">video announcing the new iMac</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Based on rumors, those two announcements are very likely to be new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chip options, along with a redesigned, smaller Mac mini with M4 and M4 Pro chip options and two front-facing USB-C ports. Just like the new iMac today, press releases and YouTube videos for the new MacBook Pro and Mac mini models are likely on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we reiterate what to expect from the new MacBook Pro and Mac mini models.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>MacBook Pro</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
Apple is expected to announce new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, including an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip, and higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
No major external design changes have been rumored for the laptops this year, with improvements such as an OLED display and thinner design not expected <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/macbook-pro-wont-switch-to-oled-in-2025-rumor/">until 2026 at the earliest</a>. However, the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to gain an additional Thunderbolt port compared to the current model, based on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-potentially-facing-worst-leak-since-iphone-4/">alleged leaks earlier this month</a>. Those same leaks revealed that the MacBook Pro lineup might finally start with 16GB of RAM, instead of 8GB, which was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/">rumored even before the leaks happened</a>. As another clue, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/new-m4-imac-minimum-16gb-ram/">new iMac has a minimum of 16GB of RAM for all configurations</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last redesigned the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2021, and the latest models with the M3 family of chips were released last October.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Mac mini</h3><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-Mac-mini-Ortho-Silver-Cooler.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972060" /><em>A concept of a smaller Mac mini</em></div><br/>
The next Mac mini is expected to be available with M4 and M4 Pro chip options. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/mac-mini-redesign-rumor/">expects the next Mac mini to be smaller</a>, making it closer in size to an Apple TV, and he said that the computer will gain two front-facing USB-C ports. All in all, the Mac mini is expected to receive its biggest redesign since 2010.<br/>
<br/>
Like the new iMac, the next Mac mini could also start with 16GB of RAM, instead of 8GB.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro and Mac mini models will likely be available to pre-order starting this week, and they are expected to launch in November. The new iMac became available to pre-order today, and it launches on Friday, November 8.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-promises-two-more-mac-announcements/">Apple Promises Two More Mac Announcements This Week Following New iMac Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-promises-two-more-mac-announcements-this-week-following-new-imac-today.2441166/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has been gradually transitioning its products from Lightning to USB-C in recent years. This trend continued today with Apple updating the Magic Mouse, Magic Keyboard, and Magic Trackpad accessories for the Mac <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-usb-c-magic-accessories/">with USB-C charging ports</a>. The accessories have no other changes, meaning the Magic Mouse's charging port is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/magic-mouse-usb-c-port-on-bottom/">still on the bottom</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/lightning-connector-feature-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-891738" /><br/>
For the time being, Apple is continuing to sell a Lightning version of the Magic Keyboard with a numeric keypad, but it lacks a Touch ID button. Apple has yet to release a USB-C version of this particular Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
The list of Apple devices and accessories that are still sold with either a Lightning port or a Lightning connector is now quite small:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE</li><br/>
<li>First-generation Apple Pencil</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1, Apple is going all in on promoting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>. Today's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> announcement was heavily focused on the Mac's &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features, and Apple has also shared two new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; ads.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Apple Intelligence Writing Tools iPhone 16" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3m0MoYKwVTM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Apple's first ad shows off Writing Tools, featuring an office worker who sends an email and uses the "Professional" rewriting feature to make it sound less casual. The well-crafted email impresses his boss.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Apple Intelligence Create memory movies iPhone 16" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0BXZhdDqZM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The second ad features a woman who forgot it was her husband's birthday, so she whips up a quick Memory Movie slideshow on her <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as a gift.<br/>
<br/>
Both Writing Tools and Memory Movies  in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app are new features that are available on devices running iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, or &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to roll out <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users in the European Union starting in April 2025, according to information included in today's &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; announcement <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/newsroom/2024/10/apple-intelligence-is-available-today-on-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">in European countries</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963902" /><br/>
Apple's newsroom post confirms that &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features will roll out beginning in April, with users gaining access to Writing Tools, Genmoji, a redesigned version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, and more. <blockquote>Mac users in the EU can access Apple Intelligence in U.S. English with macOS Sequoia 15.1. In April, Apple Intelligence features will start to roll out to iPhone and iPad users in the EU. This will include many of the core features of Apple Intelligence, including Writing Tools, Genmoji, a redesigned Siri with richer language understanding, ChatGPT integration, and more. </blockquote>As of right now, EU Mac users can access &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1, as long as the language on the device is set to U.S. English. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-europe-delay/">restricted the launch</a> of &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; capabilities for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in order to work out "regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act."<br/>
<br/>
Apple in June said that it would delay &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring, and SharePlay Screen Sharing until it was able to determine how to make the features compatible with the European Union's competition rules.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; users in the European Union who have a U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> ID are able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-apple-intelligence-outside-us/">use Apple Intelligence</a> with the Language and Region on the device set to U.S. English. In a December iOS 18.2 update, &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; will offer localized English in Ireland, as well as in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; support in European countries will likely come in an update to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and the timing is right for iOS 18.4. Rumors suggest that iOS 18.4 will be a major update that brings improvements to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, including personal context and the ability for the personal assistant to do more in and across apps. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-intelligence-eu-april-2025/">Apple Intelligence Rolling Out in the European Union Starting in April 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-rolling-out-in-the-european-union-starting-in-april-2025.2441153/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To introduce the new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> models today, Apple didn't hold a standard event, but the company did record a short keynote video to go through all of the machine's new features.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iMac Announcement - October 28" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaB7nCdId0Y" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The announcement is themed just like one of Apple's full pre-recorded event videos, starting with a view of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> that zooms in to Apple executives highlighting the M4 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;'s capabilities and once again walking through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>. The first four minutes of the video cover &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, so skip to 4:40 if you just want to watch the bit about the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has three videos to share this week, so we can expect additional M4 Mac product announcements on Tuesday and Wednesday. We are also expecting Apple to release new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> models and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a> models with a new design.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,299, and pre-orders began today. A launch will follow on November 8.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-m4-imac-keynote/">Watch Apple&#039;s Full 10-Minute M4 iMac Keynote</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watch-apples-full-10-minute-m4-imac-keynote.2441150/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's third Apple silicon <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> gains the M4 chip alongside a range of other small but notable improvements, so how does the new machine compare to its two predecessors?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-iMac-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-946085" /><br/>
The 2021 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; was the first of its kind to feature an Apple silicon chip, replacing previous Intel-based models with 21.5- and 27-inch displays. It offered an all-new ultra-thin design, a 24-inch Retina display, a six-speaker system with force-cancelling woofers, and an array of seven two-tone color options. The 2023 model was a minor update that added the M3 chip and specification updates like Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. One year later, the latest, M4 version of the device looks like a much more substantial upgrade, offering a dramatically more powerful Neural Engine, 16GB of memory as standard, a 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage, USB-C accessories, and a nano-texture display option.<br/>
<br/>
The 2021 and 2023 iMacs have now been discontinued by Apple and prices at third-party resellers are falling. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to pick up a 2021 or 2023 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; instead of the latest model, while some existing &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; users may be wondering if it's now time to upgrade to the M4 model.<br/>
<br/>
The three Apple silicon &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; models share the overwhelming majority of their features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the first- or second-generation models to save money? This breakdown also serves as a way to see all the differences that the 2024 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; brings to the table.<br/>

The 2024 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with the M4 chip marks a much more substantial upgrade compared to the 2021 and 2023 models. Key improvements such as the significantly more powerful Neural Engine for AI and machine learning tasks, increased standard memory of 16GB, 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage, and support for USB-C accessories make it an appealing choice for future-proofing. Performance-wise, it delivers a meaningful boost, especially for those upgrading from the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; or older Intel-based iMacs, where Apple claims up to 6x faster performance than the most popular Intel &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
For &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; users, the M4 model could be worth considering if they require enhanced performance or a richer set of features, such as hardware-accelerated ray tracing, nano-texture display option, or simply a better webcam. However, M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; users may find fewer incentives to upgrade, as the performance gap between M3 and M4 is good but not as significant in daily use unless the system is pushed to the limit. The M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is built to handle demanding tasks and will remain relevant for several more years, but &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; users may want to begin considering an upgrade. <br/>
<br/>
Starting at &#36;1,299, the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; remains a solid investment for those looking for a device with longevity, a robust array of features, and meaningful upgrades over the original &zwnj;M1&zwnj; model or older Intel machines. However, if you have basic needs and find a discounted 2023 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, this could still offer good value, though the M4 will better meet the needs of those seeking higher performance, better features, and a more forward-looking setup.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4/">M4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-imac/">M4 iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-vs-m3-vs-m4-imac/">M1 vs. M3 vs. M4 iMac Buyer&#039;s Guide: 25+ Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-vs-m3-vs-m4-imac-buyers-guide-25-upgrades-compared.2441149/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated its Magic Mouse, Magic Keyboard, and Magic Trackpad accessories for the Mac <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-usb-c-magic-accessories/">with USB-C charging ports</a>, but the accessories have no other external design changes. Yes, that means the Magic Mouse's charging port is still located on the bottom of the mouse, despite the switch from Lightning to USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Magic-Mouse-USB-C.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973231" /><br/>
The position of the charging port on the Magic Mouse has been the subject of a meme on social media since 2015, as it means the mouse cannot be used while it is charging in an upside-down position, but Apple is clearly unfazed.<br/>
<br/>
The augmented reality view of the new iMac on Apple's website confirms the bottom position of the USB-C port on the updated Magic Mouse, as shown above.<br/>
<br/>
Apple includes the updated Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard in the box with the iMac, and the Magic Trackpad is an optional upgrade. The USB-C versions of the accessories are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-usb-c-magic-accessories/">also sold separately</a> in white and black color options.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-mouse/">Magic Mouse</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/magic-mouse-usb-c-port-on-bottom/">The Meme Lives On: Magic Mouse&#039;s USB-C Charging Port Still on Bottom</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-meme-lives-on-magic-mouses-usb-c-charging-port-still-on-bottom.2441148/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> models, and while there are few external changes with the exception of some color tweaks, Apple made several internal updates to the machine. The inclusion of the next-generation M4 chip is the biggest update, but the ports have also seen improvement.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/imac-thunderbolt-4-ports.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973226" /><br/>
For the M4 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; models with 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, all four of the USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 4 transfer speeds of up to 40Gb/s. The prior-generation M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with four ports had two Thunderbolt 3 ports and two USB-3 ports.<br/>
<br/>
The 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU models only have two ports, but both of those are Thunderbolt 4. All of the USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports also support USB 4 and USB 3.1 Gen 2.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,299 for the 8-core CPU/GPU version, while the 10-core CPU/GPU models with four ports are priced starting at &#36;1,499.

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-iMac-M4-lifestyle-business-storefront.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-973173" /><br/>
First introduced with the Pro Display XDR in 2019, nano-texture glass is etched at a nanometer scale, which is meant to preserve image quality while scattering ambient light to cut down on glare. It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The expansive 24-inch 4.5K Retina display on iMac is its highest-rated feature, and for the first time, it's available with a nano-texture glass option that drastically reduces reflections and glare, while maintaining outstanding image quality. With nano-texture glass, users can place iMac in even more spaces, such as a sun-drenched living room or bright storefront.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The 2020 27-inch Intel-based <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> was available with a nano-texture display option prior to its discontinuation, so the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; marks the first time that the feature has been available with the Apple silicon version of the device. The new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;'s nano-texture glass is a build-to-order option that costs &#36;200, configurable at the point of purchase. It is now available across the Pro Display XDR, Studio Display, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. <br/>

While the M4 chip features notable enhancements over the M3, such as increased CPU and GPU performance and improved efficiency, the practical differences for users upgrading from an M3 system may not be as radical as the specifications suggest. The M3 chip already delivers impressive performance and efficiency, making it a formidable contender in its own right.<br/>
<br/>
The 25.1% improvement in single-core performance and 30.5% in multi-core performance highlight technical advancements, but for many users, especially those already equipped with M3-based devices, the everyday experience will likely not feel dramatically different. Tasks that benefit from single-core speeds, like launching apps and light productivity work, will be snappier, but for those accustomed to the M3's capabilities, this difference may not significantly impact their workflow.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the 21.4% increase in GPU performance means better graphics rendering and gaming capabilities, yet users who have enjoyed the M3's performance may find these enhancements less noticeable in routine tasks. The improvements in gaming and creative applications will benefit users who are heavily engaged in graphics-intensive work, but those using the M3 might not feel compelled to upgrade solely for these reasons.<br/>
<br/>
The 111% boost in the Neural Engine is a standout figure, emphasizing the chip's impressive artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning capabilities. However, for many users, especially with less demanding requirements, the difference might not justify the upgrade, especially as both the M3 and M4 chip support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>. That being said, the M4 chip's significantly improved Neural Engine makes it more likely to support and effectively run new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; and AI features as they emerge over the years. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of memory bandwidth, the 20% increase allows for faster data transfer, which is beneficial for data-heavy applications. Yet, again, for users already using the M3, this improvement may not translate into a dramatic change in performance.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, while the M4 chip certainly pushes the boundaries of what is possible in Apple's silicon, it may not represent a radical shift for those already using the M3. Instead, the M4 is likely aimed at users looking to upgrade from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chips or older Intel systems, where the jump in performance is far more pronounced.<br/>
<br/>
For existing M3 users, the decision to upgrade may hinge more on specific needs and applications rather than a broad expectation of enhanced performance. For example, M3 Max chip users who push their system to the limit with highly intensive tasks may have good reason to upgrade. Likewise, if your current M3 or M3 Pro system seems to be insufficient for your workflow, you could consider upgrading to an "M4 Pro" or "M4 Max" device when they're available, but these upgrade paths will be unusual.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4/">M4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-imac/">M4 iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macs/">M4 Macs</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3-vs-m4/">M3 vs. M4 Chip Buyer&#039;s Guide: How Much Better Really Is M4?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-vs-m4-chip-buyers-guide-how-much-better-really-is-m4.2441141/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The new iMac starts at &#36;1,299.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-iMac-M4-lifestyle-24-inch-Retina-display.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973163" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/">As rumored</a>, Apple has upped the base memory configuration of at least one of its latest Macs. It is the first time that the company has offered the ultra-thin all-in-one desktop computer with a minimum of 16GB of memory.  <br/>
<br/>
All of Apple's upcoming new Macs this year are likely to have at least 16GB of RAM pre-installed as standard, breaking a years-long tradition of Apple offering just 8GB of RAM in most of its base Macs and forcing customers to pay out an extra &#36;200+ for additional memory.<br/>
<br/>
The new iMac is available in a range of new colors, and the 24-inch 4.5K Retina display offers a new nano-texture glass option. The iMac also features a new 12MP Center Stage camera with Desk View, up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports, up to 32GB of Unified Memory, and color-matched accessories that include USB-C. <br/>
<br/>
The new iMac is available to pre-order today, with availability beginning Friday, November 8. Apple is expected to announce new MacBook Pro models and a new redesigned Mac mini later this week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/new-m4-imac-minimum-16gb-ram/">New Base M4 iMac Comes With 16GB of Unified Memory</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-base-m4-imac-comes-with-16gb-of-unified-memory.2441140/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
