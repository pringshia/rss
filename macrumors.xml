		<description><![CDATA[Apple is developing a new version of the low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> with a plastic casing, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> today claimed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-se-2022.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866330" /><br/>
Writing in this weekend's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman mentioned Apple's work on an &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; that features a rigid plastic casing in lieu of anodized aluminum. He postulated that this may be one technique Apple may be planning to use to bring the cost of the &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; down. The current &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; sells for &#36;249, but Samsung's cheapest rival watch, the Galaxy Watch FE, sells for &#36;199.<br/>
<br/>
Apple famously released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 5C with an "unapologetically" plastic casing in 2013, which was effectively a rehoused version of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5. The polycarbonate exterior was available in various vibrant color options. The device was somewhat controversial because critics argued that the plastic casing was a step down from the luxurious metal finishes of previous models and some consumers felt that the device's price point was still too high for what was perceived as an inferior product.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/apple-watch-se-with-plastic-casing/">Apple Reportedly Developing Apple Watch SE With Plastic Casing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-developing-apple-watch-se-with-plastic-casing.2430833/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has Apple's AirPods 2, AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case, and AirPods Max on sale, with up to &#36;100 in savings on these earbuds. For the AirPods 3, this is the first time we've tracked a discount on the device since Father's Day in June.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-3-Discount-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895370" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The AirPods 2 are on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00, and the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case are on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1WXVQTN%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;139.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;169.00. This discount on the AirPods 2 isn't quite an all-time low price, but it's still a great deal on the headphones that's about &#36;10 higher compared to the record low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for &#36;79.99</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's revamped version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is unlikely to be available with the initial rollout of Apple Intelligence later this year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q">latest "Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman wrote that the full new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; should arrive with iOS 18.4 in the spring of 2025, preceded by a beta testing period that is due to start in January. The more capable version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; allows the voice assistant to control actions within Apps, allowing it to understand what is currently on-screen and determine what to do based on context.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence launches in the fall. While the entire new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will not be available at this time, other &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features, such as a new design and ChatGPT integration, should be present upon the debut of Apple Intelligence this year. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier today, Gurman explained that both the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">feature a new processor</a> that succeeds last year's S9 chip. While this could "lay the groundwork for some AI enhancements down the road," it will not run Apple Intelligence and there are currently said to be no plans to bring "the full initiative" to the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">previously reported</a> that Apple Intelligence will come to the Vision Pro headset next year. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, on the other hand, is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">not slated</a> to get the new suite of features, with the company holding off for a new "AI-powered table-top robot."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/new-siri-experience-to-debut-spring-2025/">New Siri Experience With Apple Intelligence Likely to Debut in Spring 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-siri-experience-with-apple-intelligence-likely-to-debut-in-spring-2025.2430831/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Series 10 will feature a larger display and a new chip, but new health monitoring features for the device are now in question, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/f1662570472.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-861885" /><br/>
In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q">latest edition</a> of his "Power On" newsletter, Gurman said that the design of the Apple Watch Series 10 is "unlikely to look much different" to its predecessor, but it will be thinner. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch Ultra will not get a new design this year.<br/>
<br/>
The new Apple Watch "Series" models will continue to be available in two casing sizes codenamed "N217" and "N218," and feature larger displays. One of the models will have a screen roughly as large as that of the Apple Watch Ultra. <br/>
<br/>
Both the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 will apparently feature a new processor that succeeds last year's S9 chip. While this could "lay the groundwork for some AI enhancements down the road," it will not run Apple Intelligence and there are currently said to be no plans to bring "the full initiative" to the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been developing hypertension and sleep apnea detection features for the Apple Watch that were originally slated for release in 2024, but Gurman now says that the "effort hasn't gone smoothly" and "Apple has run into some serious snags." The hypertension detection feature has been insufficiently reliable during testing and there are concerns about integrating it into the refreshed design, which could force Apple to postpone this feature until next year<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the sleep apnea detection feature is now in trouble because it relies on blood oxygen saturation, which Apple Watches in the United States cannot currently measure due to an ongoing legal dispute with Masimo. Gurman postulates that the despute with Mazimo could be resolved by September, or Apple could find a way around it by arguing that the blood oxygen sensor could be used for purposes that are not directly related to blood oxygen levels. The company could also announce the sleep apnea detection feature and hold off releasing it until a later date. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is also purportedly continuing testing and discussing the prospect of 3D-printed casings for some Apple Watch models, which could accelerate production and use less material.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says it is still not clear whether Apple will brand the new Apple Watches as special anniversary models or wait until next year, given that the original Apple Watch was announced in 2014 and released in 2015.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the calendar flipping over to July, public betas of iOS 18 and related operating system updates are right around the corner, so we're continuing to take a look at what changes and features users can expect to see.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/top-stories-6jul2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957645" /><br/>
Other Apple news and rumors this week included several iconic devices being added to Apple's list of "vintage" products, a leak from Apple's servers pointing to work on a rumored "Home Accessory" separate from the Apple TV and HomePod, and a rumor about which other products may gain support for Apple Intelligence features, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18: 10 New Home Screen and Lock Screen Features</h2><br/>
iOS 18 features a more customizable Home Screen, with dark and tinted options for app icons, the ability to place app icons anywhere on the grid, and more. In addition, the Flashlight and Camera shortcuts at the bottom of the Lock Screen can now be assigned to other actions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Home-Screen-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957461" /><br/>
To learn more, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-home-screen/">check out our list of 10 new Home Screen and Lock Screen features on iOS 18</a>. The update is compatible with the iPhone XS and newer, and it is in developer beta now ahead of a public beta later this month and a full release likely in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Says iPhone X, HomePod, and Original AirPods Now 'Vintage'</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/iphone-x-homepod-and-original-airpods-now-vintage/">added three more significant devices to its vintage products list this week</a>, including the iPhone X, the first-generation HomePod, and the original AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iphone-x-gradient.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957626" /><br/>
Apple considers a product to be "vintage" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers can continue to offer repairs for vintage products for up to two years, but only if the necessary parts remain available.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Leak Confirms Apple's Work On 'Home Accessory'</h2><br/>
An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/">unreleased device with the identifier "HomeAccessory17,1"</a> has been spotted in code on Apple's servers, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" /><em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/">MacRumors mockup</a> of rumored HomePod with display on a robotic arm</em></div><br/>
This leak follows reports from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman that said Apple was developing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/">new version of the HomePod with a built-in display</a>. Like existing HomePods, the new model is expected to run a variant of tvOS.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Gurman: Apple Intelligence Coming to Vision Pro, But Not HomePod</h2><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman this week said that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">Apple Intelligence suite of AI features will be available on the Vision Pro headset in the future</a>, but unfortunately not on existing HomePod models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
It is believed that existing HomePods lack sufficient RAM to power Apple Intelligence features smoothly, but it is possible that the features will be available on the rumored HomePod with a display in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The MacRumors Show: Luke Miani Talks Apple Watch X</h2><br/>
YouTuber and podcaster Luke Miani joins us on this week's episode of The MacRumors Show to discuss the latest rumors about the upcoming Apple Watch "Series X."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/The-MacRumors-Show-Apple-Watch-X-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957640" /><br/>
The Apple Watch Series X, coming ten years after the Apple Watch was originally announced alongside the iPhone 6, was initially rumored to be a major overhaul of the device. Now, it looks like the upgrade will be more minor than expected, focusing on new casing and display sizes, but with a design that continues to be effectively the same, so Dan, Hartley, and Luke delve into the conflicting rumors.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Kuo: New AirPods to Feature Cameras for Enhanced Spatial Experiences</h2><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/">mass produce new AirPods with at least one built-in infrared camera by 2026</a>, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/airpods-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931501" /><br/>
Kuo said the infrared cameras could allow for future AirPods to feature in-air gesture controls, and enhanced compatibility with the Vision Pro headset. For example, he said when a user looks in a certain direction, spatial audio could be optimized accordingly.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today said it has approved the third-party <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> Store in the European Union, allowing the Fortnite developer to launch its alternative app marketplace in those countries, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/epic-games-says-apple-stalling-launch-its-game-store-europe-2024-07-05/">reports <em>Reuters</em></a>. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/fortnite-epic-game-store-submitted-apple/">submitted</a> the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store</a> to Apple for notarization earlier this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite_apple_featured.jpg" alt="" width="2140" height="1204" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-754674" /><br/>
Earlier today, Epic stated Apple had <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809179985682325649">twice rejected</a> the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store this week, with Apple reportedly claiming that an "Install" button and "in-app purchases" labels were too similar to Apple's own elements for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Epic argued that the rejection was "arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA [Digital Markets Act]" and that it was reporting the issue to the European Commission, but it appears Apple has relented and <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809321159906980133">approved Epic's previously rejected submission</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; and Apple have been engaged in a years-long battle over Apple's closed &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; ecosystem, and Epic has been eager to launch its own marketplace in the EU under Apple's new policies driven by the Digital Markets Act.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/apple-approves-epic-games-store-eu/">Apple Approves Epic Games Store for iPhone and iPad in EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-approves-epic-games-store-for-iphone-and-ipad-in-eu.2430756/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_4FpYQOt3I?si=eS-bxLPZWdBz8Z5W" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The Apple Watch Series X, coming ten years after the Apple Watch was originally announced alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 6, was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">initially rumored</a> to be a major overhaul of the device. Now, it looks like the upgrade will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/kuo-2024-apple-watch-no-significant-innovation/">more minor than expected</a>, focusing on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">new casing and display sizes</a>, but with a design that continues to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10/">effectively the same</a>. The current 41mm and 45mm casing options are likely to be replaced with 45mm and 49mm models, meaning that the larger model would be the same size as the Apple Watch Ultra. The two models are expected to offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/08/apple-watch-series-x-larger-display-rumor/">1.89-inch and 2.04-inch display sizes</a>, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series X could also feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/apple-watch-2024-health-features/">hypertension and sleep apnea detection</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/2024-apple-watch-more-power-efficient-display/">more efficient display</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/next-apple-watch-thinner-logic-board-rumor/">thinner logic board</a>. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is expected to be largely the same as the previous model, but potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">adding a black color option</a> and the health features also coming to the Series X. A third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> could also be on the way with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/08/apple-watch-series-x-larger-display-rumor/">larger casing and display sizes</a> of the Apple Watch Series 7, increasing from 40mm and 44mm to 41mm and 45mm. <br/>
<br/>
We also discuss mouse support in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> and our reflections on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> after three and a half years with Apple's premium over-ear headphones.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> will gain the tetraprism periscope camera with 5x optical zoom that debuted last year on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240704PD215/gseo-apple-periscope-lens-adoption-iphone.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-camera.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910485" /><br/>
Taiwanese lens manufacturers Largan Precision and Genius Electronic Optical (GSEO) are said to be the primary suppliers for the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s tetraprism camera components. Sources close to the supply chain have indicated that both Largan and GSEO are now ramping up production in preparation for the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup.<br/>
<br/>
Largan, which supplied the periscope lenses for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, is expected to secure a substantial portion of the orders once again. Largan's chairman, Adam Lin, recently indicated that the optical components sector is expected to see peak sales from September to November, aligning with the anticipated release period for the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models. <br/>
<br/>
GSEO, a new entrant in the supply chain for this component, is reportedly undergoing quality testing with promising results. According to <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em>, GSEO's periscope lenses are currently undergoing validation, with production expected to begin in mid-July if they pass the necessary tests. <br/>
<br/>
The tetraprism periscope lens introduced on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max offers up to 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom – a major improvement over previous models, which were limited to 3x optical zoom at most. In addition to the advancements in optical zoom with the telephoto camera, the periscope lens is also expected to improve overall image stabilization and low-light performance.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/apple-to-bring-5x-telephoto-to-iphone-16-pro/">Apple Again Rumored to Bring 5x Telephoto Camera to iPhone 16 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-again-rumored-to-bring-5x-telephoto-camera-to-iphone-16-pro.2430740/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's deal with Google that makes it the default engine on Safari faces uncertainty as the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit looms, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-struggles-to-lessen-reliance-on-apple-safari"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/safari-icon-blue-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833485" /><br/>
Apple's contract with Google, which ensures that Google's search engine is the default on Apple's Safari browser, has been a significant source of revenue. In 2022, the arrangement reportedly netted Apple over &#36;20 billion, an amount derived from 36 percent of the ad revenue generated by searches on Safari, as revealed in court documents.<br/>
<br/>
The agreement has substantial financial implications for both companies. For Apple, the payments from Google constitute an important revenue stream as a significant proportion of its profits. If the court rules against Google, it could lose access to approximately 70 percent of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> searches. This would significantly impact Google's mobile search advertising revenue, which was a major contributor to its &#36;207 billion in search ad revenue in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Google has been working to reduce its reliance on the deal. The company has been actively encouraging &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to switch from Safari to its own apps, Google and Chrome. Google has invested heavily in enhancing its mobile apps with features such as the Lens image search function and the Discover feed, which surfaces personalized content. In 2022 and 2023, Google launched extensive TV and online advertising campaigns showcasing exclusive features available only on its apps. However, over the past five years, Google has only  managed to increase the percentage of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; searches conducted through its apps from 25 percent to the low 30s. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Google hired Robby Stein, a former Instagram and Yahoo executive, to spearhead efforts to increase the adoption of its apps among &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users. Stein's strategies include exploring the integration of generative AI to enhance the appeal of Google's mobile apps. The company now wants to double the number of Google searches performed outside Safari, even as the number accomplished in the Google and Chrome apps stalled last year.<br/>
<br/>
The shift is particularly important to Google in an effort to mitigate the impact of the potential outcome of the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit. A ruling against Google would also set a precedent for how Apple's default settings and competitive practices are regulated.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/antitrust-lawsuit-threatens-apple-deal-with-google/">Antitrust Lawsuit Threatens Apple&#039;s Lucrative Deal with Google</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/antitrust-lawsuit-threatens-apples-lucrative-deal-with-google.2430736/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In 2025, Apple is expected to discontinue the iPhone "Plus" device in its iPhone 17 lineup to make way for an iPhone "Slim" – although it may not actually be called this when it debuts in the fall of next year. Even though the iPhone 16 series launch is still over two months away, when you consider that we learned about larger displays on the iPhone 16 Pro models way back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">May 2023</a>, rumors about a two-generations-away iPhone isn't all that unusual so far ahead of time. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-17-Plus-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952009" /><br/>
While we await this year's iPhone 16 series, here's a compilation of everything we have heard from reputable sources so far about Apple's so-called iPhone 17 "Slim." <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">iPhone 17 Slim: Rumors So Far</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Thinner Design</span><br><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025">The Information</a></em>, Apple's all-new iPhone 17 model next year will have a "significantly thinner" design with an aluminum chassis, rather than a titanium casing like Apple's Pro models. The news outlet also claims that the device will feature a narrower Dynamic Island, potentially due to Apple's adoption of a smaller "metalens" for the Face ID system. Internally code-named D23, the device's redesign has been described as a major one equivalent to the iPhone X.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Smaller Display</span><br><br/>
The first details about the size of the device's display arrived courtesy of Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who said it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">6.6 inches</a>. However, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young</a>, it will feature a 6.55-inch display. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Plus has a 6.7-inch display. Apple is still said to be testing different designs for the slimmer phone, so the display size could always change between now and the device's launch.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Relocated Cameras</span><br><br/>
<em>The Information</em> claimed that the iPhone 17 "Slim" will have cameras in locations we haven't seen before on an iPhone. According to a May report, the rear cameras could be moved to the "top center" of the device. Some Android phones like Google's Pixel 8 Pro have rear cameras in a top-center position, but Apple's iPhone camera system has occupied the top-left corner ever since the 2007 model. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Anti-Reflective Coating</span><br><br/>
All iPhone 17 models will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">Chinese Weibo leaker Instant Digital</a>. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 series is said to have a "super-hard anti-reflective layer" that is "more scratch-resistant." It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">ProMotion Technology</span><br><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/iphone-17-always-on-promotion-displays/">The Elec</a></em>, all iPhone 17 models will feature OLED displays with low-power backplane technology, bringing ProMotion to Apple's non-Pro iPhone models for the first time. ProMotion allows the display to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when required. ProMotion also allows the display to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, which is why the iPhone 15 Pro screens feature an always-on capability that shows the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Improved Selfie Camera</span><br><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the entire iPhone 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and this year's iPhone 16 lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. The upgraded resolution on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Internal Upgrades</span><br><br/>
Haitong analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">claims</a> the iPhone 17 "Slim" will feature 8GB of RAM, compared to 6GB of RAM on the iPhone 15 Plus. It's worth noting that all upcoming iPhone 16 models are expected to be fitted with 8GB of RAM – a hardware requirement of on-device Apple Intelligence. According to <em>The Information</em>, the device will also be equipped with Apple's A19 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Higher Price</span><br><br/>
<em>The Information</em> reported that the slimmer iPhone 17 could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which currently starts at &#36;1,199, suggesting that the device would become the ew highest-end model in the lineup, bettering the iPhone 17 Pro Max. If that's the case, then perhaps the "iPhone Slim" will end up being the "iPhone Ultra" that has been rumored for several years.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">iPhone 17 &#039;Slim&#039;: Everything We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know-so-far.2430727/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Twilio has updated its Authy two-factor authentication (2FA) service after a hacker claimed to have retrieved 33 million phone numbers from its user database.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/authy.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957591" /><br/>
<em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/03/twilio-says-hackers-identified-cell-phone-numbers-of-two-factor-app-authy-users/">TechCrunch</a></em> reports that the hacker(s) known as ShinyHunters took to a well-known hacking forum to boast about the theft of 33 million cell phone numbers, achieved by what Twilio described as the use of an "authenticated endpoint." <br/>
<br/>
The U.S. messaging giant confirmed this week that "threat actors" gained access to its servers, resulting in the theft of users' phone numbers, but it did not specify how many were accessed. The company said it had taken action to secure the exploit and prevent similar future unauthenticated requests.<br/>
<blockquote>"We have seen no evidence that the threat actors obtained access to Twilio's systems or other sensitive data," said the company in a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/en-us/changelog/Security_Alert_Authy_App_Android_iOS">blog post</a>. "While Authy accounts are not compromised, threat actors may try to use the phone number associated with Authy accounts for phishing and smishing attacks; we encourage all Authy users to stay diligent and have heightened awareness around the texts they are receiving."</blockquote>As Twilio notes, obtaining a list of phone numbers may not appear in itself to pose a severe security threat. However, attackers could conceivably contact users and claim to be Authy or Twilio representatives in order to get them to reveal personal information as part of a phishing campaign. <br/>
<br/>
Users should update to the latest version of the iOS app, available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Twilio also advises users who cannot access their Authy account to contact its support team immediately.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Code discovered on Apple's backend by <em>MacRumors</em> confirms Apple is indeed working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/27/touchscreen-homepod-everything-we-know/">long-rumored</a> home accessory in addition to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" /><br/>
The code references a device with the identifier "HomeAccessory17,1," which is a new identifier category. The name is similar to the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;'s "AudioAccessory" identifier.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, the 17,1 in the identifier name suggests that this device may receive Apple's upcoming A18 chip, which will be used in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/iphone-16-models-a18-chip/">all four iPhone 16 models</a> later this year. With the A18 chip, the HomeAccessory device would have the power for Apple Intelligence. <br/>
<br/>
The code also indicates that this "home accessory" will be running a software variant of tvOS, much like the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;. Earlier this year, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/">found evidence</a> of Apple's work on homeOS, which could be the firmware running on this device.<br/>
<br/>
On a similar note, the code also references two unreleased &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models with the identifiers AppleTV14,4 and AppleTV14,5. Rumors suggest</a> that an updated &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; could launch in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce new iPhones, iPads, and potentially other products in September.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI has issued an update to its <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/mac/">ChatGPT app for Mac</a>, after a developer discovered the app was locally storing users' conversations with the chatbot in plain text.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/2chatgpt-mac-app.jpg" alt="" width="2940" height="1912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951953" /><br/>
Pedro José Pereira Vieito told <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191636/openai-chatgpt-mac-app-conversations-plain-text">The Verge</a></em>'s Jay Peters: "I was curious about why OpenAI opted out of using the app sandbox protections and ended up checking where they stored the app data." <br/>
<br/>
That led Pereira Vieito to develop "ChatGPTStealer," a simple app to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@pvieito/post/C85NVV6hvF6?xmt=AQGz0o3JtBOwk1nfUgk8lvxQoIV8E92xz1vK1IP8VC6zhA">demonstrate</a> how easy it is to load the chats in a text window outside of the ChatGPT app. After successfully trying out the app for himself, Peters said he was also able to see the text of conversations on his computer just by changing the file name, indicating the extent of the privacy risk.<br/>
<br/>
The ChatGPT Mac app is available solely through OpenAI's website, which is why it has not been obligated to follow Apple's sandboxing requirements that apply to software distributed via the Mac App Store. The oversight basically meant any other running app or process could potentially access the ChatGPT conversations without prompting the user for permission.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will reportedly use a more advanced SoIC packaging technology for its M5 chips, as part of a two-pronged strategy to meet its growing need for silicon that can power consumer Macs and enhance the performance of its data centers and future AI tools that rely on the cloud.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tsmc_semiconductor_chip_inspection_678x452.jpg" alt="" width="678" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756102" /><br/>
Developed by TSMC and unveiled in 2018, SoIC (System on Integrated Chip) technology allows for the stacking of chips in a three-dimensional structure, providing better electrical performance and thermal management compared to traditional two-dimensional chip designs. <br/>
<br/>
According to the <em>Economic Daily</em>, Apple has expanded its cooperation with TSMC on a next-generation hybrid SoIC package that additionally combines thermoplastic carbon fiber composite molding technology. The package is said to be in a small trial production phase, with the intention of mass producing the chips in 2025 and 2026 for new Macs and AI cloud servers.<br/>
<br/>
References to what are believed to be Apple's M5 chip have already been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/a19-and-m5-chips-discovered/">discovered</a> in official Apple code. Apple has been working on processors for its own AI servers made with TSMC's 3nm process, targeting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/">mass production by the second half of 2025</a>. However, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/">Haitong analyst Jeff Pu</a>, Apple's plans in late 2025 are to assemble AI servers powered by its M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Apple's AI cloud servers are believed to be running on multiple connected M2 Ultra chips, which were originally designed solely for desktop Macs. Whenever the M5 is adopted, its advanced dual-use design is believed to be a sign of Apple future-proofing its plan to vertically integrate its supply chain for AI functionality across computers, cloud servers, and software.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the introduction of OLED displays, a thinner design, and more in the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, we thought it was worth taking another look at Samsung's flagship OLED tablet, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, to see how the two compare and which one might be the better purchase for you.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Pl-Ww8MZW4?si=qi2lbOvViKAdvxdC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Both tablets offer excellent OLED displays, though the Tab S9 Ultra's 14.6-inch 16:10 display is better optimized for video consumption than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s 13-inch 4:3 display. The wider aspect ratio on the Tab S9 Ultra means widescreen video content fits much better on the display, offering a larger content view with much less letterboxing than on the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The Tab S9 Ultra's display is rated just a bit brighter than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s, but in real-world usage the difference isn't noticeable. HDR content on the Tab S9 Ultra can get a bit too bright, however, washing out other content. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; also does a better job of handling glare, and that's not even accounting for the Nano-Texture option available on higher-end &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; configurations.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and Tab S9 Ultra have similarly thin profiles, with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s new design making it just a hint thinner than Samsung's offering, but the difference feels negligible. The Tab S9 Ultra maxes out at 1TB of built-in storage while the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; goes up to 2TB, but Samsung includes a microSD slot that makes it simple to pop in extra storage at a much lower cost than boosting the integrated storage on an &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple removed the Ultra Wide camera in the latest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, leaving only the standard Wide camera for capturing video content. Samsung includes both styles of camera on the Tab S9 Ultra, but we don't think most people should be using their iPads for capturing video anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Where Apple really sets itself apart on the hardware side with &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is the redesigned Magic Keyboard, which offers a premium feel, solid typing performance, an excellent trackpad, and an additional USB-C port for charging the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. Samsung's first-party keyboard accessory for the Tab S9 Ultra looks and feels good, and the typing experience is pleasant, but the trackpad is simply awful.<br/>
<br/>
One note in favor of Samsung's keyboard is that it can be separated into two pieces, leaving the back cover attached to the tablet for protection. While Apple has a keyboard design like this for cheaper iPads, the Magic Keyboard can not be removed from the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; without also removing the back cover.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, Apple introduced a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro with more advanced capabilities including new gestures and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> support, but Samsung has the S Pen that also offers excellent integration with Android. Significantly for stylus adoption, the S Pen is included in the box with the Tab S9 Ultra, while the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro is an extra &#36;129 purchase for &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; owners.<br/>
<br/>
As with most purchasing decisions for Apple and Android, it's likely to come down to platform preference. If you're already thoroughly invested in the Apple ecosystem, you're probably going to want to go with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; to reap all of the benefits that come with Apple's tight integration. But if you're looking for something a bit different, Samsung's Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra offers some great features and a huge display at a price that well undercuts the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>

Online merchants powered by Shopify, Stripe, and more can <a href="https://tiptop.com/partner/signup">offer Tiptop at checkout</a>, with launch partners including electronics brand Nothing, game controller maker Backbone, pre-owned smartphone market Phonedaddy, and others. Tiptop manages the entire program for a merchant, including the trade-in, payment, and shipping.<br/>
<br/>
After selecting the Tiptop option during checkout on a participating merchant's website, you can search for the Apple product or other item that you would like to trade in, confirm the trade-in amount being offered, and choose to pay the remaining balance in full or in four interest-free installments. To send the item being traded in to Tiptop, customers can scan a QR code to start the prepaid shipping process, or have a courier pick up the item.<br/>

Tiptop was founded by Bastian Lehmann, who also co-founded popular delivery service Postmates, and its marketing head is former <em>TechCrunch</em> editor-in-chief Matthew Panzarino. The startup had previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/tiptop-shop-trade-in-app/">launched a trade-in app</a>, but it is now promoting this trade-in service that online merchants can integrate into the checkout flow.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/03/tiptop-instant-trade-in-credit-for-apple-products/">Tiptop Provides Instant Trade-In Credit for Apple Products When Shopping Online</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiptop-provides-instant-trade-in-credit-for-apple-products-when-shopping-online.2430602/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix is proceeding with its plan to discontinue its cheapest ad-free subscription tier, starting with the UK and Canada, with more countries inevitably to follow.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884792" /><br/>
The streaming giant has reportedly begun <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1cgefm4/choose_a_new_plan_now_to_keep_watching/">notifying</a> users via on-screen messages about the last day they can access the service unless they upgrade. One Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dsse4n/cant_finish_netflix_subscription/">shared a notification</a> they had received from the Netflix app, saying: "Your last day to watch Netflix is July 13th. Choose a new plan to keep watching." Customers are being prompted to instead choose the cheaper Standard with ads, or the more expensive Standard or Premium 4K plans.<br/>
<br/>
In the UK, users are being informed that their £7.99 per month Basic plan has been discontinued and that they can sign up to the Standard with adverts plan for £4.99 or pay £10.99 for the Standard plan. The £10.99 plan includes access to 1080p streams, viewing on two devices simultaneously, and downloads on up to two devices. Meanwhile, the Standard with adverts tier still offers 1080p video quality but of course injects ads into streams.<br/>
<br/>
Canadian subscribers are also receiving notifications about the last viewing day for their Basic plan. In Canada, the price increase is more significant, rising from &#36;9.99 for the Basic plan to &#36;16.49 for the Standard plan. Alternatively, users can save &#36;4 by going with the Standard with Ads plan (&#36;5.99).<br/>
<br/>
The Basic plan, which costs &#36;11.99 per month in the United States, has not been available to new subscribers since last year. In its early 2024 earnings call, Netflix announced its intention to retire its Basic plan in some countries where the ads plan has been introduced, starting with Canada and the UK in the second quarter, and then "taking it from there." Netflix said in May that its ad-supported streaming tier has 40 million global monthly active users, up 35 million from a year ago.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/03/netflix-phasing-out-basic-ads-free-plan/">Netflix Starts Booting Subscribers Off Cheapest Basic Ads-Free Plan</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-starts-booting-subscribers-off-cheapest-basic-ads-free-plan.2430600/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today continued with the launch of its annual "Back to School" promotion, debuting back to school deals in most countries in Europe, some countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/back-to-school-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956521" /><br/>
Higher education students and educators in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk-edu/store#home">UK</a> can get up to a £120 Apple gift card with the purchase of select Macs and iPads, which is a similar deal to the one that went live in the United States and Canada <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-back-to-schoo-promotion-launches/">last month</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is offering a £120 gift card with any new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, and a £80 gift card with the purchase of any new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>. The gift card can be used towards purchases of Apple products and accessories, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> apps, subscriptions to services like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>+ storage, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile in most other countries, Apple is offering AirPods with every Mac or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> with every <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sold through its education stores.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is providing its standard educational discounts, and students are able to get lower prices on Macs and iPads through the EDU store in each country, a link to which can be found under "Education" at the bottom of regional Apple stores. Students are also eligible for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ at a 20% discount.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Back to School promotion requires verification through UNiDAYS in many countries, with full terms and conditions available on the promotional pages for Apple's country-specific websites.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/back-to-school-promotion/">Back to School Promotion</a> will last through October 21, 2024 in most of the above listed countries, but it does end in September in some locations, such as Mexico.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/back-to-school-promotion/">Back to School Promotion</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/03/apples-back-to-school-sale-launches-europe-asia/">Apple&#039;s Back to School Sale Live in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-back-to-school-sale-live-in-europe-asia-and-the-middle-east.2430598/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
