		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that three more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> games will be available on the Vision Pro headset starting this Thursday, March 28.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Altos-Odyssey-The-Lost-City-Vision-Pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943720" /><br/>
The titles coming to the Vision Pro tomorrow include popular endless runner game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/altos-odyssey-remastered/id1538650027">Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City</a>, hand-drawn adventure game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gibbon-beyond-the-trees/id1482634476">Gibbon: Beyond the Trees</a>, and physics-based puzzler <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spire-blast/id1532717034">Spire Blast</a>. All three games are already available on Apple Arcade on other devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.<br/>
<br/>
"On March 28, players can soar above windswept dunes in a fantastical place far from home in Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City, dive into an immersive jungle with a family of gibbons in the 2022 Apple Design Award winning Gibbon: Beyond the Trees, and collapse vibrant towers of all shapes and sizes that appear in their physical space in the fun physics-based puzzle game Spire Blast," said Apple, in an email about the games.<br/>
<br/>
Accessible through the App Store, Apple Arcade is a subscription-based service that provides access to hundreds of games across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Vision Pro, all free of ads and in-app purchases. The service <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">received its first price increase</a> last year, with U.S. pricing rising from &#36;4.99 to &#36;6.99 per month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/more-apple-arcade-games-coming-to-vision-pro/">Vision Pro Getting More Apple Arcade Games, Including Alto&#039;s Odyssey</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-getting-more-apple-arcade-games-including-altos-odyssey.2422948/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's brand new 13-inch 256GB M3 MacBook Air has hit <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX23V2ZK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;999.00</strong></a> today on Amazon, down from &#36;1,099.00. This sale is available in Midnight, but you might be able to get in Space Gray depending on stock, which has been fluctuating today. <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1814977-REG/apple_mrxv3ll_a_13_6_macbook_air_m3.html/BI/2696/KBID/3612/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1429879/SID/DFF">B&H Photo is matching this sale</a>.<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This is a new all-time low price on the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air, and it accompanies a similarly steep discount on the 15-inch model that we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/low-price-15-inch-m3-macbook-air-2/">started tracking last week</a>. In that sale, you can get the 15-inch 256GB M3 MacBook Air for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX251F4X%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,204.00</strong></a>, a &#36;95 discount.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX23V2ZK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>13-inch M3 MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;999.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
These MacBook Air models just launched earlier in the month, coming in both 13-inch and 15-inch sizes. Both of the new MacBook Air machines include the M3 chip and focus on internal upgrades. Apple did not change the design of the MacBook Air with the 2024 update, using the same design that was first introduced in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Because of these new MacBook Air models, we're also tracking <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/best-buys-sale-ipads-playstation/">record low prices on previous generation models</a>. Best Buy currently has both the 13-inch and 15-inch M2 MacBook Air at all-time low prices, with up to &#36;300 off select computers. <br/>

		<title>Apple Pay Express Mode Now Available at Toronto Subway Stations</title>

		<description><![CDATA[TTC subway stations in Toronto recently added support for Apple Pay's Express Mode, allowing riders to simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near the reader at the turnstile to pay for their fare. With Express Mode, payment can be completed without waking or unlocking the device, or authenticating with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. Express Mode even works for up to five hours after an iPhone's has run out of battery power.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Pay-Canada.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943673" /><br/>
As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewe/status/1772056065296752816">Toronto resident Andrew Escobar</a>, it is still not possible to add a PRESTO card to the Apple Wallet app, so Express Mode is limited to credit and debit cards added to the Wallet app for now. Public documents related to recent TTC meetings suggest that the PRESTO card will gain Apple Wallet support later this year.<br/>
<br/>
To set up a credit or debit card for use with Apple Pay, open the Wallet app on the iPhone, tap the plus sign in the top-right corner, and follow the on-screen instructions. To set a payment card as the default option for Express Mode, open the Settings app on the iPhone, tap Wallet & Apple Pay, tap Express Transit Card, and select a card.<br/>
<br/>
Some readers elsewhere in the TTC system already worked with Apple Pay's Express Mode. Apple periodically updates a list of locations where Apple Pay's Express Mode is available for transit on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#apple-wallet-transit">iOS feature availability page</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/apple-pay-express-mode-ttc-subway-stations/">Apple Pay Express Mode Now Available at Toronto Subway Stations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-express-mode-now-available-at-toronto-subway-stations.2422945/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple retail stores are now receiving information about the company's new system for wirelessly updating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> software prior to sale, <em><a href="https://www.igen.fr/iphone/2024/03/apple-store-presto-met-un-iphone-jour-en-15-minutes-boite-fermee-142655">iGen</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Store-Vancouver-Canada.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901784" /><br/>
Last week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-iphone-in-box-update-system-rollout/">reported</a> that the new proprietary system, called "Presto," will begin operation across the U.S. in April. Gurman first reported on the wireless system in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/retail-stores-to-update-iphones-with-new-system/">October</a>, describing it as a "proprietary pad-like device" upon which retail store staff can place a sealed ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ box. The system wirelessly turns on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; inside, updates its software to the latest available version, and then powers it off.<br/>
<br/>
Presto features small lockers that can accommodate six &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; boxes simultaneously. There are markings to ensure that boxes are correctly positioned for NFC depending on their size. Once correctly positioned, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will update within 15 to 30 minutes. <em>iGen</em> has now shared a still from a video showing two of the machines stacked one on top of the other:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-presto.jpg" alt="" width="1419" height="1070" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-943631" /><br/>
Presto was developed by Apple's Backstage Operations team, which designs tools for technicians and retail store employees. The company developed "Presto" as a way to avoid selling iPhones in retail stores with outdated software. For example, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series shipped with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, but Apple subsequently released iOS 17.0.1 before the devices launched. The update was required to fix an issue that prevented the transfer of data directly from another &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; during the initial setup process.<br/>
<br/>
Apple apparently intends to have the technology in all U.S. retail stores by early summer. Retail locations outside the U.S. are also now receiving information about how Presto works. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/">Retail</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/what-new-machine-to-update-iphones-looks-like/">Here&#039;s What Apple Retail&#039;s New Machine to Update iPhones in the Box Looks Like</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-what-apple-retails-new-machine-to-update-iphones-in-the-box-looks-like.2422942/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Vision Pro has received its first discount today at Woot, now available for <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-mql83ll-a-vision-pro-256gb%3Fref%3Dcnt_wp_0_1"><strong>&#36;3,349.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;3,499.00, but Woot does not make it clear what size light seals and head bands are in the box. The headset is in new condition and it comes with a one year Apple manufacturer limited warranty.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929939" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Woot. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
So far, Vision Pro has only been available through Apple, as head scans are required in order to ensure proper sizing of the light seal and head bands. Woot's product listing does not offer a selection of sizes and does not specify what sizes of light seal and head bands are included, so it is unclear what customers will receive with their orders.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-mql83ll-a-vision-pro-256gb%3Fref%3Dcnt_wp_0_1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;150 OFF</div>Apple Vision Pro for &#36;3,349.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Despite the murkiness with the sizes, Woot's discount today is notable as the very first sale we've ever seen from any major retailer for the Apple Vision Pro, which launched back in February. Woot says that this sale will last until it sells out, and there's an estimated delivery date between April 8 and April 10.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on late Tuesday released revised versions of iOS 17.4.1 and iPadOS 17.4.1 with an updated build number of 21E237, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1772852431463850020">Aaron Perris</a>. The updates previously had a build number of 21E236.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Orange-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898582" /><br/>
The revised updates are available for all iPhone and iPad models that are compatible with iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, but they can only be installed <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109046">via the Finder app on macOS</a> and the Apple Devices or iTunes apps on Windows at this time. Apple has not made the new builds available over the air in the Settings app on the iPhone and iPad.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear what changed between the builds, if anything, but any potential differences are likely very minor. For those curious, we have confirmed that the new builds <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1772859926630559945">do not contain</a> any references to unreleased iPad models.<br/>
<br/>
There have been sporadic reports on social media about iOS 17.4 and iOS 17.4.1 causing some iPhones to get stuck in a boot loop, so perhaps the new build will allow those devices to be properly restored, but this is merely speculation.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4.1 and iPadOS 17.4.1 were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-releases-ios-17-4-1/">first released last week</a> with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/ios-17-4-1-qr-code-scanning-bug/">bug fixes</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/ios-17-4-1-security-fix-notes/">security patches</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone shipments in China dropped by 33% in February compared to the same month last year, according to governement figures (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/iphone-china-shipments-fell-about-33-in-feb-state-data-show">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-15-china.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943595" /><br/>
A report from China's Academy of Information and Communications Technology showed that foreign brands shipped around 2.4 million smartphones last month. Given that Apple is the only overseas vendor with a meaningful market share, the company accounts for the vast majority of those shipments.<br/>
<br/>
The decline in February marks the third consecutive month of lower iPhone shipments. Apple in January shipped some 5.5 million units in China, which is around 39% fewer handsets than the same time last year. In December, the company suffered a 30% year-on-year decline in the country.<br/>
<br/>
Apple appears to be facing an uphill battle to reverse falling iPhone sales in China, with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/china-iphone-sales-slump-early-2024/">24% year-on-year decline</a> in 2023 projected to deepen through 2024. Apple resellers in China have been increasingly dependent on discounts to shift ‌iPhone 15‌ stock. The discounts followed Apple's own rare price reductions on its website ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in February. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's efforts to counter the slump are also likely to be hampered by China's decision last year to ban iPhones from the offices of multiple government agencies and state companies. China has a huge number of state-owned enterprises in power generation, seaport construction, mining, manufacturing, education, and investment markets.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also having to contend with strong interest in Huawei's latest home-grown Mate 60 lineup, which was released in September just weeks before the iPhone 15 launched. Huawei's Mate 60 Pro uses a new China-made 7-nanometer processor tailored for the local market, showcasing the kind of advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities that US sanctions were originally designed to prevent.<br/>
<br/>
The overall Chinese smartphone market contracted by almost a third in February, according to research firm Canalys. Analysts still predict growth over the course of the year, but expect iPhone 15 sales to keep falling while local rivals continue to aggressively promote AI features in device marketing. CEO Tim Cook <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/tim-cook-visits-shanghai/">visited China earlier this month</a> to Apple's newest store in Shanghai and attend the China Development Forum in Beijing, where he said the country was "critical" to Apple.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/iphone-shipments-china-decline-february/">Apple&#039;s iPhone Shipments in China Fell 33% Last Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-iphone-shipments-in-china-fell-33-last-month.2422927/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>6.1-Inch iPhone SE 4 OLED Panel Likely to Be Supplied by China&#039;s BOE</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple supplier BOE has taken the lead in becoming the OLED panel supplier for the fourth-generation iPhone SE, <em><a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/758/418.htm">IT Home</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
Samsung Display, BOE, and Tianma have all been in discussions with Apple to supply the OLED panels, but today's report claims that Samung has withdrawn from negotiations due to pricing problems, despite having an existing iPhone 14 OLED inventory to draw from. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly been holding out for &#36;25 per panel, but Samsung's final offer was &#36;30, which is lower than the two Chinese manufacturers. That leaves BOE and Tianma as potential suppliers, however Tianma has not yet met Apple's stringent quality requirements, leaving BOE in pole position to win the majority of the orders, if not all of them.<br/>
<br/>
The panel prices for the iPhone SE 4 are said to be a lot lower than suppliers charge for the OLED displays used in the iPhone 15, since the panels for the SE will use legacy parts identical to those used in the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, so the suppliers won't need to make new investments in R&D. Display manufacturers are believed to have been bidding to supply the panels since at least <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/suppliers-bidding-on-iphone-se-4-displays/">last August</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/">rumored</a> to feature an iPhone 14-like design with a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, an Action button, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/iphone-se-4-design-revealed-in-cad-renders/">CAD renders</a> of the device corroborated previous design rumors for the iPhone SE 4, which is expected to launch in 2025. Despite the rumored upgrades, the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 may face faster depreciation than Apple's higher-end models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/iphone-se-4-expected-to-depreciate-heavily/">according to one report</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/">OLED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/boe/">BOE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/iphone-se-4-oled-supplier-likely-boe/">6.1-Inch iPhone SE 4 OLED Panel Likely to Be Supplied by China&#039;s BOE</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/6-1-inch-iphone-se-4-oled-panel-likely-to-be-supplied-by-chinas-boe.2422926/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Phishing attacks taking advantage of Apple's password reset feature have become increasingly common, according to a report from <em><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/recent-mfa-bombing-attacks-targeting-apple-users/">KrebsOnSecurity</a></em>. Multiple Apple users have been targeted in an attack that bombards them with an endless stream of notifications or multi-factor authentication (MFA) messages in an attempt to cause panic so they'll respond favorably to social engineering. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/reset-password-request-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="3617" height="2035" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943548" /><br/>
An attacker is able to cause the target's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple Watch, or Mac to display system-level password change approval texts over and over again. Because the password requests target the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>, they pop up on all of a user's devices. The notifications render all linked Apple products unable to be used until the popups are dismissed one by one on each device. Twitter user Parth Patel recently <a href="https://twitter.com/parth220_/status/1771589789143478471">shared his experience</a> being targeted with the attack, and he says he could not use his devices until he clicked on "Don't Allow" for more than 100 notifications.<br/>
<br/>
The actual popup can't be used to gain access to an Apple device, and it serves as a front for attackers to incite fear in the target. Following the flood of notifications, the attacker calls using a spoofed number that makes it appear to be coming from Apple. On these calls, the attacker confirms that the victim's account is under attack, and that sensitive information is needed to put a stop to it. It appears that the attacker is after a one-time code to confirm a password reset or login attempt. <br/>
<br/>
In Patel's case, the attacker was using information leaked from a people search website, which included name, current address, past address, and phone number, giving the person attempting to access his account ample information to work from. The attacker happened to have his name wrong, and he also became suspicious because he was asked for a one-time code that Apple explicitly sends with a message confirming that Apple does not ask for those codes.<br/>
<br/>
The attack hinges on the perpetrator having access to the email address and phone number associated with an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; at a minimum, and given the description of what's been happening, it is likely that bad actors also had access to the victim's &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; password from database leaks and other means. One-time codes are most often triggered as secondary security, so the attacker sends the notification spam, calls the target to "save" them from the attack, logs in to the &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; with the stolen information and password, and triggers the one-time code. If the target hands over the code at this point, the attacker will have full access to the &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<em>KrebsOnSecurity</em> looked into the issue, and found that attackers appear to be using Apple's page for a forgotten &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; password to send the notification spam. This page requires a user's &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; email or phone number, and it has a CAPTCHA. When an email address is put in, the page displays the last two digits of the phone number associated with the Apple account, and filing in the missing digits and hitting submit sends a system alert.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear how the attackers are abusing the system to send multiple messages to Apple users, but it appears to be a bug that is being exploited. It is unlikely that Apple's system is meant to be able to be used to send more than 100 requests, so presumably the rate limit is being bypassed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple device owners targeted by this attack should remain calm and make sure not to provide sensitive information to someone who calls, even if the phone call appears to be coming from Apple. Spoofing a phone number is a simple thing to do, so the best course of action is to hang up and call Apple support directly. There is never a situation where a one-time code should be shared with another person, and Apple will never ask for a code.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> This article has been updated to clarify how the attack works. The prior version suggested that an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; could be accessed should someone press "Allow" on one of the password request popups, but that is inaccurate. This is a complicated, multi-step attack that requires social engineering, but the password reset spam is a component that Apple will hopefully address in a future update. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-password-reset-phishing-attack/">Warning: Apple Users Targeted in Phishing Attack Involving Rapid Password Reset Requests</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/warning-apple-users-targeted-in-phishing-attack-involving-rapid-password-reset-requests.2422902/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple may be planning to add support for "custom routes" in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, according to code reviewed by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-maps-3d-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="896" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-841030" /><br/>
&zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; does not currently offer a way to input self-selected routes, with Maps users limited to Apple's pre-selected options, but that may change in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. Apple has pushed an &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; file to its maps backend labeled "CustomRouteCreation." While not much is revealed by the file except for the name, it does mention that this upcoming feature will be limited to the United States at launch.<br/>
<br/>
Custom routes would allow users to set what specific roads they want to travel down, whether for scenic purposes or for the familiarity of a route. Route options beyond the default have been a <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252235149">highly requested</a> &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; feature for several years now, and other services like Google Maps allow users to create custom routes on a computer and then view them on an iOS device.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will be introduced at the Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, June 10. For more details about the update, check out our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18 roundup</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While Apple does not plan to hold a traditional in-person WWDC event this year, the company will invite select developers and students to attend a special event at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-park-special-event-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943518" /><br/>
On Monday, June 10, Apple will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/special-event/">host a keynote viewing party</a> to let attendees watch the pre-recorded unveiling of new software updates. Apple also promises "exciting new programming," an opportunity to meet with Apple experts, and other "special activities."<br/>
<br/>
At <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/wwdc-2023-apple-park-viewing-event-details/">last year's special event</a>, developers and students were provided with refreshments in the morning, followed by the keynote event. The Platforms State of the Union followed, and there were two &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; tours to choose from. The day ended with the Apple Design Awards and an evening dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Note that there will be a reception event at Apple's Infinite Loop campus on Sunday, June 9, where attendees can pick up their badges early.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to 2020, the Worldwide Developers Conference was an in-person event that was hosted in San Jose, California. Developers were required to pay &#36;1,599 to purchase a ticket to attend, and space was limited. Starting in 2020, Apple turned WWDC into an online event open to all developers, but there have been small in-person events at &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; since 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Lottery Selection</h2><br/>
Apple is inviting a limited number of developers and students to &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; for the special event, and attendees will be selected through a lottery process.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Who is Eligible to Attend</h2><br/>
Current Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program members can ask to attend, as can Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni and Swift Student Challenge winners from 2022 to 2024.<br/>
<br/>
350 Swift Student Challenge winners are set to be announced on Thursday, March 28. 50 Distinguished Winners will receive an invite to a special three-day experience that includes the special event on June 10.<br/>
<br/>
Both adults and children aged 13 to 17 can apply, but children will need to be accompanied by a legal guardian.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Register for Apple's Special Event</h2><br/>
Those eligible to enter the lottery can do so on Apple's developer website <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/special-event/request/">through the special event request page</a>. Apple is accepting requests to attend through 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, April 3.<br/>
<br/>
Attendees chosen by the random selection process will be informed about their status by the end of the day on Thursday, April 4.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Costs</h2><br/>
There is no cost to attend the special event at &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj;, but Apple will not cover transportation. Out-of-state attendees will need to purchase plane tickets, accommodations at nearby hotels, and will need to find a way to get to &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; on the day of the event.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Media</h2><br/>
In addition to inviting developers and students, Apple will likely extend invitations to select members of the media. Media invites for the &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; event have not yet gone out.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>WWDC Details</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> will take place from Monday, June 10 to Friday, June 14. Developers who are not selected to attend can watch the June 10 keynote event on Apple's website or on YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
For those unable to watch the live stream, or who prefer to read a text version of the announcements, we'll have live &zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; coverage both here on MacRumors.com and through our <a href="https://twitter.com/macrumorslive?lang=en">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>, so make sure to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to share all of the WWDC sessions and events in its Developer app and on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-developer-youtube-account-wwdc-2024/">new Apple Developer YouTube channel</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/wwdc-2024-apple-park-special-event/">WWDC 2024 Will Include In-Person Special Event at Apple Park</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wwdc-2024-will-include-in-person-special-event-at-apple-park.2422883/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/apple-set-to-unveil-ai-strategy-at-june-10-developers-conference"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> today reported that Apple is not planning to debut its own generative AI chatbot with its next major software updates, including iOS 18 for the iPhone. Instead, he reiterated that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/">held discussions with companies such as Google, OpenAI, and Baidu</a> about potential generative AI partnerships.<br/>
<br/>

Recent reports indicated that Apple has considered licensing existing chatbots, such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-iphone-ai-talks-google-openai-ongoing/">Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>, but Apple offering its own chatbot of some kind on iOS 18 had not been explicitly ruled out until now.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman still expects AI to be a major focus at Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">just-announced WWDC 2024 developers conference</a>. He reiterated that Apple plans to announce new AI features that "assist users in their daily lives," but he did not provide any specific details. He has previously reported that generative AI will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">improve Siri's ability to answer more complex questions</a>, and allow the Messages app to auto-complete sentences. Other apps like Apple Music, Shortcuts, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are also expected to gain generative AI functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already promised that the company would share generative AI announcements <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">later this year</a>, and the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-ios-18-ai-wwdc-2024/">hinted at it again today</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced official dates for the 35th annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which is set to begin on Monday, June 10. In its announcements, Apple sometimes gives us minor hints on what to expect, and Greg Joswiak is making some not-so-subtle references to AI.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840591" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" /><br/>
In a tweet, Joswiak said that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> event is going to be "Absolutely Incredible," and he deliberately capitalized the first two letters of each word, AI.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mark your calendars for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC24?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWDC24</a>, June 10-14. It’s going to be Absolutely Incredible! <a href="https://t.co/YIln5972ZD">pic.twitter.com/YIln5972ZD</a></p>&mdash; Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) <a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1772671384335925493?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
There have been multiple rumors suggesting that AI will be a major focus in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, macOS 15, and other operating system updates that are set to come out this year. Apple will add AI features to many of its built-in apps, and the company is in talk with Google and other companies about integrating an existing large language model (LLM) into &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of the last few months, Apple executives have confirmed Apple's work on AI, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/tim-cook-apple-generative-ai-break-new-ground/">said in February</a> that Apple plans to "break new ground" on generative AI in 2024. "We believe it will unlock transformative opportunities for our users," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
Cook in November confirmed that Apple was "investing quite a bit" in AI, and during Apple's most recent earnings call, he said that Apple was spending a "tremendous amount of time and effort" on AI, with details set to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">come out later in 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; is set to take place during the week of June 10, and it will begin with a keynote event that will see the unveiling of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and other operating system updates.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-ios-18-ai-wwdc-2024/">Apple Hints at iOS 18 AI Announcements Coming at WWDC 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-hints-at-ios-18-ai-announcements-coming-at-wwdc-2024.2422876/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As part of today's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> announcement, Apple said that it plans to announce this year's Swift Student Challenge winners on Thursday, March 28. The annual Swift Student Challenge asks students to create an innovative coding project using the Swift Playgrounds app.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932478" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/swift-student-challenge-2024.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" /><br/>
While Apple normally starts the Swift Student Challenge when WWDC dates are announced, the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/apple-2024-swift-student-challenge/">launched the challenge early</a> to give students more time to work on their projects.<br/>
<br/>
Submissions were accepted from February 5 to February 25, and are now closed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is selecting 350 winners for the 2024 challenge, all of whom will be eligible to attend the June 10 WWDC Special Event at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California. Winners will need to enter the lottery process to get a chance to attend.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also choosing 50 Distinguished Winners recognized for "outstanding submissions." The Distinguished Winners will be invited to Cupertino for a three-day experience that will include the Special Event keynote viewing and other activities.<br/>
<br/>
Swift Student Challenge winners will be informed via email if they've won later this week. Projects are judged based on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and the content of written responses explaining the project.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/swift/">Swift</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/swift-playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-swift-student-challenge-winners-march-28/">Apple to Announce 2024 Swift Student Challenge Winners on March 28</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-announce-2024-swift-student-challenge-winners-on-march-28.2422871/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In preparation for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a>, Apple today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AppleDeveloper/">launched a new Apple Developer YouTube account</a>, which will be used to share WWDC sessions and events that developers can follow along with.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-developer-youtube.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943455" /><br/>
Apple has seeded the new account with a selection of videos from WWDC 2023, and this gives us an idea of the kind of content that we can expect to see during the &zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; season.<br/>
<br/>
Videos are organized into playlists by topic, making it easy to find content on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Swift, Spatial Computing, Safari, and more.<br/>
<br/>
In the &zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; announcement, Apple said that developers can experience WWDC24 throughout the week on YouTube, referencing the new YouTube channel. Apple also plans to share content on the developer website and the Apple Developer app. Videos uploaded to YouTube will include all of the different video sessions that Apple holds on the latest software updates.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; is set to kick off on Monday, June 10, and we are expecting to see <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, and more.<br/>

As with WWDC events since 2020, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> will be an online event that is open to all developers at no cost.<br/>
<br/>

&zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; will include online sessions and labs so that developers can learn about new features and software set to be announced at WWDC.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will hold a &zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; keynote event on Monday, June 10 to show off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, tvOS 18, macOS 15, watchOS 11, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2. The keynote event will be available on the Apple Developer app, the Apple website, and YouTube, with Apple also planning to share videos and information all week long.<br/>
<br/>
Though &zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; is an online event, Apple is once again <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/special-event/">planning a special event</a> for select developers and students, which is set to take place on June 10 at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California. Attendees will be able to watch the keynote and State of the Union presentations at &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj;, as well as meet Apple employees and attend the Apple Design Awards. <br/>
<br/>
Current Apple Developer Program members, Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni, prior Swift Student Challenge winners, and current Apple Developer Enterprise Program members can <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/special-event/">enter to attend the Apple Park event</a>, with Apple choosing participants through a random lottery.<br/>
<br/>
Apple normally holds a Swift Student Challenge when the WWDC dates are announced, but the challenge <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/apple-2024-swift-student-challenge/">kicked off earlier this year</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE has dropped to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8RVB8%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a> today on Amazon, down from &#36;249.00. This is just &#36;10 higher compared to its all-time low price on the wearable. This deal is available in the Silver Aluminum Case with Winter Blue Sport Loop and Starlight Aluminum Case with Starlight Sport Loop, and only Amazon has the discount.<br/>
<br/>

You can also get the 44mm GPS Apple Watch SE on sale right now, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWYCT6C%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;219.00</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;279.00. This is another near all-time low price that's just &#36;10 away from the lowest price on the Apple Watch SE, and it's available in Silver and Starlight Aluminum options.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This model of the Apple Watch SE launched in September 2022 and remains Apple's most affordable Apple Watch. The Apple Watch SE lacks some of the upgraded features you'll find in some Series 9 or Ultra 2 models, like temperature sensing and ECG functionality, but it will otherwise provide you with all key Apple Watch features, and at the cheapest price possible.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Canva has <a href="https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/affinity/">acquired</a> Serif's Affinity suite of creative apps, marking a significant stride in its competition against Adobe with a deal valued at several hundred million dollars (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/canva-acquires-affinity-design-suite-in-push-to-rival-adobe"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>

Canva is an Australian online design company valued at &#36;26 billion. Its platform offers user-friendly design tools aimed at non-professionals and has a user base of over 175 million people worldwide. The acquisition of the Affinity apps marks a change of strategy for Canva, targeting professional designers and creatives who have traditionally relied on Adobe's suite of products.<br/>
<br/>
Affinity's software, encompassing photo editing, vector illustration, and desktop publishing tools, has been been lauded for its performance, affordability, and one-time purchase model – a stark contrast to Adobe's subscription services. The apps have garnered a strong following among Mac users in particular.<br/>
<br/>
The acquisition includes the transition of Serif's 90-person team to Canva, ensuring continuity in the development and support of Affinity apps. Cliff Obrecht, Canva's co-founder and Chief Operating Officer, emphasized that Affinity's portfolio is the "final piece in our jigsaw," indicating how the apps are expected to complement Canva's existing array of AI-powered design solutions and collaborative online workspaces.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/affinity-photo/">Affinity Photo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/affinity-designer/">Affinity Designer</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/affinity-publisher/">Affinity Publisher</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/canva-acquires-affinity-apps/">Canva Acquires Serif&#039;s Affinity Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/canva-acquires-serifs-affinity-apps.2422854/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Tencent is one of the biggest multimedia companies in the world and its apps and services are ubiquitous in China. It owns Weibo, WeChat, QQ, WeBank, Tencent Pictures, and games such as Honor of Kings and PUBG. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> and many other entertainment services such as Disney+ are not available in China. "Without Tencent's contribution, Apple would have faced a greater challenge in marketing the Vision Pro in China," the report explains, calling the company's move "critical" to the device's success in the country.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> confirmed that the Vision Pro will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/vision-pro-to-launch-in-china-this-year/">launch in China this year</a>. It is likely to be more expensive in China due to import taxes and could even be marketed under a different name due to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/vision-pro-trademark-issues-in-china/">trademark dispute with Huawei</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also apparently seeking Chinese partners to help it launch and run &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, and Apple Fitness+ in the country. The company has not launched any new services in China since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> in 2017 due to government restrictions.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/chinese-apps-coming-to-vision-pro/">&#039;Critical&#039; Chinese Apps Coming to Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/critical-chinese-apps-coming-to-apple-vision-pro.2422850/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At least one accessory maker is already preparing for the iPhone 16's rumored Capture button, according to an <a href="https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/1772507715694203055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1772507715694203055%7Ctwgr%5E5e7be999487209a61c674e1803ad1f7e3ce7e390%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrumors.com%2F2024%2F03%2F26%2Fiphone-16-pro-case-with-capture-button-cutout%2F">image shared today by Sonny Dickson</a>.<br/>

Dickson showed off a third-party iPhone 16 Pro case that includes a cutout below the power button on the right edge, which is where the Capture button is expected to be located. It is unclear if the accessory maker has direct knowledge of the new button, or if it is simply aware of the rumor, but it is betting on the change happening.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> was first to report about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">Apple's plans to add a Capture button</a> to all iPhone 16 models launching later this year. The button reportedly provides <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">quick access to various camera controls</a> for capturing photos and video. Specifically, it was reported that users will be able to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus on a subject with a light press, and start a video recording with a more forceful press.<br/>
<br/>
The button's touch sensitivity, and the fact it is expected to sit flush with the frame, explains why the case has a cutout for the button instead of covering it.<br/>

The new button would be ideally positioned on the top edge of iPhone 16 models when recording horizontal video, providing users with an easy-to-reach shutter button. The volume buttons currently serve this purpose when the Camera app is open.<br/>
<br/>
The location of the Capture button will require the mmWave 5G antenna window to be moved to the bottom-left edge on iPhone 16 models sold in the U.S., below the volume buttons. This antenna window does not exist in any other countries, as international models of the iPhone 12 through iPhone 15 are limited to sub-6 GHz 5G.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 16 series in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonny-dickson/">Sonny Dickson</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/iphone-16-pro-case-with-capture-button-cutout/">iPhone 16: Accessory Maker Prepares for All-New Capture Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-accessory-maker-prepares-for-all-new-capture-button.2422849/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
