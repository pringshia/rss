		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new firmware update for the Lightning version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2. The new firmware is version 6B34, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/airpods-pro-2-firmware-6b32/">6B32 firmware</a> introduced in November.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new in the update, but prior software releases have been refining functionality introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> such as Adaptive Audio.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not give customers instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">iOS 17.2</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-rc-to-developers/">watchOS 10.2</a>, Siri can access data from the Health app for health and fitness queries, according to Apple's release notes for the updates, which are currently in beta. For the Apple Watch, this functionality is limited to the Series 9 and Ultra 2, as these are the only models that support on-device Siri processing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iOS-17-Health-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906604" /><br/>
For example, Apple says users can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, ask about the progress of closing their Activity rings for the day, or ask about their blood glucose level if they have a connected monitor.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2142151/ios-17-2-watchos-10-2-siri-health-features.html"><em>Macworld</em> shared</a> examples of supported queries:<ul><li>How many steps have I taken today?</li><br/>
<li>How many steps have I taken this week?</li><br/>
<li>What's my heart rate?</li><br/>
<li>What's my blood oxygen level?</li><br/>
<li>Check my Exercise ring.</li><br/>
<li>How does my Move ring look today?</li><br/>
<li>What's my average walking heart rate?</li><br/>
<li>How many calories have I burned?</li></ul>On the Apple Watch, health data is limited to the previous week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Siri is also gaining the ability to log data in the Health app. <em>Macworld</em> shared another list with examples of supported queries:<ul><li>My weight is 195.3 pounds.</li><br/>
<li>I started spotting today.</li><br/>
<li>I've taken my 6 pm medications.</li><br/>
<li>My body temperature is 98.5 degrees.</li><br/>
<li>My period started today.</li><br/>
<li>My blood sugar is 143.</li><br/>
<li>Record my blood pressure as 118 over 76.</li></ul>This functionality must be enabled first to work. On the iPhone, open the Settings app and select Health → Data Access & Devices → Siri, and then toggle on "Access Health Data." On the Apple Watch, open the Settings app and select Health → Apps and Services → Siri, and then toggle on "Allow Siri Access to Health Data."<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 and watchOS 10.2 are expected to be released next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-allows-siri-to-access-health-data/">iOS 17.2 and watchOS 10.2 Allow Siri to Access and Log Health Data</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-and-watchos-10-2-allow-siri-to-access-and-log-health-data.2412897/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17.2 Brings Qi2 Support to iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 Models</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.2 update that Apple is set to release to the public in the near future will bring support for the next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models. Qi2 was mentioned in the release notes for the RC version of the update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-rc-to-developers/">that came out today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911511" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/magsafe-blue-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
With the addition of support for the new standard, &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; models will work with Qi2 wireless chargers. Qi2 is a next-generation Qi wireless charging technology that incorporates a Magnetic Power Profile. Qi2 devices will work like accessories that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, using magnets for alignment and speedier charging. Apple added Qi2 support to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models ahead of release, so they are already compatible with the standard.<br/>
<br/>
The Magnetic Power Profile was designed based on ‌&zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;‌ contributions from Apple, and it is being combined with the new Extended Power Profile (EPP) to form what is considered "Qi2." Qi2 is meant to ensure that phones and other battery-powered mobile products are perfectly aligned with chargers for improved energy efficiency and faster charging. It will allow for new accessories that would not be chargeable wirelessly using existing flat surface-to-flat surface devices.<br/>
<br/>
While Qi2 chargers will be able to charge devices at up to 15W, it is not yet clear if Apple's iPhones will support faster wireless charging speeds with Qi2 accessories. For the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, for example, Apple's technical specifications page says that the devices still support Qi wireless charging "up to 7.5W" despite the fact that they work with Qi2.<br/>
<br/>
The first Qi2 accessories are set to launch during the holiday season.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qi2/">Qi2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-qi-iphone-13-14-models/">iOS 17.2 Brings Qi2 Support to iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-brings-qi2-support-to-iphone-13-and-iphone-14-models.2412896/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate versions (RCs) of upcoming iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-releases-ios-17-2-beta-4/">the fourth betas of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>. The RCs represent the final version of the software that is expected to be provided to the public. <br/>
<br/>

Journal entries support pictures, voice recordings, and location information, with the app organized by entry date.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, there's a Favorites playlist that houses everything you've favorited, plus Apple added support for collaborative playlists. You can now share a playlist with multiple people, and each participant can add songs.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate version of an upcoming watchOS 10.2 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming a week after Apple seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-beta-4-to-developers/">fourth watchOS 10.2 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901009" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Watch-Faces-watchOS-10-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
To install the ‌watchOS 10.2‌ update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌ can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.2 adds support accessing Health app data using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, though this feature is limited to the newest Apple Watches. The update also reintroduces an option to change watch faces by swiping left and right, along with a handful of other new features. Apple's release notes for the update are below.<blockquote>watchOS 10.2 includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes, including:<br/>
<br/>
- Access and log Health app data with Siri (Available on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2)<br/>
- Automatically view Now Playing when in proximity of HomePod (2nd generation) or HomePod mini playing media from Music or Podcasts (Available on - Apple Watch Series 6 and later and Apple Watch Ultra)<br/>
- Enable the ability to swipe to change watch faces in Settings<br/>
- Enable the ability to confirm ending workouts in Settings<br/>
- Prioritize the volume of either the music or trainers’ voices in most Fitness+ workouts<br/>
- Resolves an issue that can cause watch faces added in the Watch app on iPhone to not appear on Apple Watch</blockquote>Apple is expected to release watchOS 10.2 to the public next week. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-rc-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Release Candidate Version of watchOS 10.2 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-release-candidate-version-of-watchos-10-2-to-developers.2412889/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate version of an upcoming tvOS 17.2 to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-beta-4-to-developers/">release of the fourth tvOS 17.2 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.2 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes, but tvOS 17.2 introduces an overhauled &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
The app now includes a sidebar that houses content from both Apple's services and streaming services that integrate with the tvOS Watch Now feature. There are dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>‌, MLS Season Pass, Sports, the Store, and the Library at the top of the sidebar, along with dedicated sections for streaming services like ABC, CBS, Comedy Central, Hulu, ESPN, Discovery, Peacock, Prime Video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
You can click into each streaming service to see content that's available specifically on that service, and there's also a new My TV section that replaces "My Channels."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-rc-to-developers/">Apple Seeds tvOS 17.2 Release Candidate to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-release-candidate-to-developers.2412888/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beeper Mini, a new app that ostensibly brings iMessage to Android devices with no need for sign-in with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> credentials, today launched <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeper.ima">on the Google Play Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/beeper-mini.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925247" /><br/>
Beeper Mini operates by identifying text message conversations from iMessage users and converting them to the recognizable blue bubbles associated with Apple's exclusive messaging service. This enables Android users to interact with iMessage features such as reactions, threads, high-quality media sharing, and group chats, without the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users noticing any difference.<br/>
<br/>
The app represents a departure from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/nothing-announces-imessage-compatibility/">previous methods</a> of accessing iMessage on non-Apple devices, which typically involved relaying messages through a Mac hosted in the cloud or signing in with an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;. Beeper Mini's approach involves direct communication with Apple's servers by registering a user's phone number with iMessage, a process that apparently required extensive reverse engineering of Apple's messaging system.<br/>
<br/>
Beeper is a startup led by Eric Migicovsky that aims to consolidate various messaging services into a single platform. Since its initial launch on desktop devices in 2021, Beeper raised &#36;16 million in funding. Beeper claims that Beeper Mini does not access messages, contacts, or &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; passwords. The app's code will also be made open source, offering transparency and allowing for independent review.<br/>
<br/>
Beeper Mini is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeper.ima">now available for download</a> on the Google Play Store, with a seven-day free trial followed by a subscription fee of &#36;2 per month. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/">iMessage</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android/">Beeper Mini Brings iMessage to Android With No Need for Apple ID Sign-In</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android-with-no-need-for-apple-id-sign-in.2412881/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Twelve South today introduced its newest product, called the "<a href="http://shrsl.com/4c1s8">ButterFly</a>" and priced at &#36;129.99. The device is a compact 2-in-1 MagSafe-compatible charger that can fuel up an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Apple Watch at the same time.<br/>
<br/>

Twelve South says that when closed, the ButterFly is about the size of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> case. When unfolded, a small strip of vegan leather connects the magnetic fast charger for Apple Watch and MagSafe-compatible charger for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or AirPods.<br/>

You can fold the accessory into a hands-free display stand for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or tilt the Apple Watch magnetic charger up and use Nightstand Mode. The device includes a 30W USB-C power adapter and four international plug adapters. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a collection of deals that are matching - or nearly matching -  the same all-time low discounts we saw during Black Friday. This includes the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, 9th generation iPad, and M1 MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/airpods-pro-bulbs.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923440" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with Apple's AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case, these earbuds have returned to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0CHWRXH8B"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. This is a match of the best price we've ever tracked on this version of the AirPods, and right now only Amazon has the sale.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0CHWRXH8B"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Next, Amazon has the 9th generation iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Fth%3D1"><strong>&#36;249.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;329.00. During Black Friday, we saw this model go down to around &#36;230 at its lowest point, but today's deal is a solid second-best option and potentially the best deal you'll see before the holiday shopping season ends.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ipad-bulbs.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923456" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Fth%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;80 OFF</div>9th Gen iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;249.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Finally, Amazon has the M1 MacBook Air (256GB) for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;749.99</strong></a> when you clip an on-page coupon, down from &#36;999.00. Although a few years old at this point, this &#36;249 discount on the 2020 13-inch MacBook Air is a great deal for anyone who needs a simple and reliable entry-level notebook for browsing the Internet.<br/>
<br/>

Across the lineup, there are also multiple prices that are matching the record low Black Friday prices we saw this year, and the first time we've seen them return since the shopping holiday ended.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-se-gold.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923362" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
Starting with the 41mm GPS Apple Watch Series 9, you can get this model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5R8BP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;309.99</strong></a> in (PRODUCT)RED Aluminum, down from &#36;399.00. Only one color is available at this price, but there are a few others at solid second-best prices of around &#36;330, which was the Black Friday deal this year.<br/>
<br/>
This sale, along with every other one in this article, requires you to clip an on-page coupon located under the price on Amazon's product page. Once you do this, you can head to checkout and you'll see the correct all-time low price listed in your cart.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>

This one is available in multiple color options and it's a direct match of the discount we tracked during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXF9R4Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;89 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm GPS) for &#36;359.99</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple supplier BOE still can't catch a break in its production of OLED displays for iPhone 15 models. According to a new report by <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231205PD204.html">DigiTimes</a></em>, the Chinese-based manufacturer is still struggling to expand panel supply due to yield issues.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iphone-15-dynamic-island.jpg" alt="" width="2096" height="1179" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912522" /><br/>
Despite investing in panel research and development, BOE has continually struggled with yield rate problems, particularly for OLED panels for the iPhone 15 basic model. The panels were conditionally approved for mass production by Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/apple-samsung-oled-iphone-15-panels/">March 2023</a>, but in September the supplier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-oled-display-orders-dominated-by-samsung/">failed to get formal approval</a> and Apple ended up dropping the order.<br/>
<br/>
BOE was supposed to be supplying OLED displays for both the standard ‌iPhone 15‌ and larger ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, but that fell through when the manufacturer experienced problems with light leakage around the portion of the OLED display where the pill and hole cutouts secure the space necessary for the TrueDepth camera and Face ID, where the Dynamic Island is located.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-dynamic-island-iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 15: What Dynamic Island Does and How to Use It</a></li></ul><br/>
Initial speculations suggested that BOE might supply around 5 million iPhone 15 panels in 2023. However, due to delays and poor yield rates, the expected supply volume has been reduced to 2 to 3 million panels. What makes things worse for BOE is that the light leakage is harder to avoid on a larger panel. As a result, it is now considered very unlikely that BOE will get production approval for the iPhone 15 Plus panels in 2023. Its yield rate is still estimated to be around only 30%.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Samsung Display supplies panels for the entire iPhone 15 series and held a 91% market share in these kinds of panels from June to August 2023. If BOE cannot expand its supply, Samsung will reap the benefits once again.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/boe/">BOE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/iphone-15-oled-supplier-problems-persist/">iPhone 15 OLED Supplier Still Plagued by Leaky Light Issues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-oled-supplier-still-plagued-by-leaky-light-issues.2412860/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has asked the Indian government to exempt existing iPhones from new rules that require smartphones sold in the country to have a USB-C charging port, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-warns-indias-eu-style-charger-rules-will-hit-local-production-target-2023-12-05/">Reuters</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
India wants to replicate an upcoming European Union rule that requires all smartphones to implement the USB-C charging standard. However, according to a new report, Apple has told India its local production targets will be hit if the country requires all iPhones to have USB-C charging ports.<br/>
<blockquote>In a closed-door Nov. 28 meeting chaired by India's IT ministry, Apple asked officials to exempt existing iPhone models from the rules, warning it will otherwise struggle to meet production targets set under India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, according to the meeting minutes seen by <em>Reuters</em>.</blockquote>Only the newest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models currently have the USB-C port. The problem for Apple is that many consumers in India prefer to buy older models like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, which Apple produces in India for local sales and exports as part of its adherence to the country's PLI scheme.<br/>
<blockquote>"If the regulation is implemented on earlier models of mobile phones, they (Apple) will not be able to meet the PLI targets," the minutes quoted Apple's regulatory and product compliance executives as saying while opposing the rules.</blockquote>While the EU regulation comes into effect in December 2024, India has said it wants compliance by June 2025. According to the report, Apple told officials it can comply with that timeline if existing models are exempted from the rules, but will need 18 months beyond 2024 if they are not. India's IT ministry is said to have decided to review its request in light of the meeting and will reach a decision later. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/">USB-C</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-india-exempt-usb-c-charging-standard/">Apple Pushes Back Against iPhone USB-C Regulations in India</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pushes-back-against-iphone-usb-c-regulations-in-india.2412856/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An increasing number of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users are reporting a persistent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> bug that causes the app switcher to suddenly appear when they are typing on the screen. If you have experienced this frustrating issue, you are not alone. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-General-Keyboard-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904723" /><br/>
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255245306">Apple Community forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/17i3ty7/app_switching_while_typing/">Reddit</a> contain similar reports of people being kicked out of Messages, Notes, and other apps mid-sentence only to find themselves in another app because they were still tapping the screen when the app switcher suddenly appeared. <br/>
<br/>
You can <a href="https://share.icloud.com/photos/03dLrdmaTOPNY0bSiGlYxKpcQ">see it in action here</a>. The bug can be hard to replicate, but it seems to happen to affected users when they have been typing on the virtual keyboard at pace for a while. The bug has been reported in all versions of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; up to and including the most recent iOS 17.1.2 update, and some users have returned their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; only for it to occur on the replacement device, suggesting that Apple is not sufficiently aware of the problem. <br/>
<br/>
Until Apple deals with the issue, there is a temporary fix – or more accurately a workaround, since it involves turning off Reachability, a feature that some users will undoubtedly miss. Reachability is an optional feature that lowers the top half of the screen so it's within easy reach of your fingers. Here's how to disable it.<br/>
<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under "Physical and Motor," select <strong>Touch</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Turn off the switch next to <strong>Reachability</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/turn-off-reachability.jpg" alt="" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925198" /><br/>
<br/>
Disabling Reachability appears to stop the typing bug in its tracks for everyone affected, which suggests Apple has an unidentified sensitivity issue linked to the accessibility feature. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta has revealed plans to end Instagram users' ability to chat with Facebook accounts later this month, rolling back a feature that it introduced over three years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/instagram-messenger.jpg" alt="" width="3440" height="1680" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925192" /><br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/30/facebook-unifies-messenger-and-instagram/">September 2020</a>, Meta (then Facebook) announced it was merging its Facebook Messenger service with Instagram direct messaging, allowing Instagram users to chat with Facebook users and vice versa using the same platform.<br/>
<br/>
The move was supposed to be part of a long-term plan to merge Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp chat platforms into one underlying messaging infrastructure. The idea behind the plan was said to be to keep people within the Facebook ecosystem, and off of rival texting apps like Apple's iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
However, according to an <a href="https://help.instagram.com/654906392080948">updated Instagram support page</a>, beginning in mid-December the following cross-app communication features will no longer be available to Instagram users:<br/>
<blockquote><ul><li>You won't be able to start new conversations or calls with Facebook accounts from Instagram.</li><br/>
<li>Any existing chats on Instagram that you've had with Facebook accounts will become read-only, even if these Facebook accounts are removed from the chat. This means that you and others with Instagram accounts can't send new messages in these chats.</li><br/>
<li>Facebook accounts won't be able to view your Activity Status or whether you've seen a message.</li><br/>
<li>Any existing chats you've had with Facebook accounts won't move to your inbox on Facebook or Messenger.</li></ul></blockquote>When cross-app chat ends, Instagram users will need to start a new chat on Messenger or Facebook from their Facebook account to continue conversations with Facebook accounts.<br/>
<br/>
Meta offered no reason for the change, but <em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/12/04/instagram-facebook-messenger-chats-disconnected/">9to5Google</a></em> speculates that it could be part of a larger effort to comply with Europe's Digital Markets Act (DMA). The theory is that Meta could be preparing to introduce wider interoperability between Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, which would fulfill a key requirement of the DMA. Either that or it is simply scaling back Messenger once again – the company recently removed SMS/MMS support on Android and has shut down Messenger Lite.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook-messenger/">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/instagram-messenger-chats-disconnecting/">Instagram and Facebook Messenger Chats to Disconnect This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-and-facebook-messenger-chats-to-disconnect-this-month.2412848/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix has been "completely satisfied" with the pace of the password sharing crackdown it initiated in the United States earlier this year, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said today at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference (via <em><a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/netflix-hollywood-strikes-interruption-originals-sarandos-1235820488/">Variety</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884792" /><br/>
The streaming company first began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/18/netflix-password-sharing-latin-america/">eliminating password sharing</a> in in several countries in Latin America in 2022, requiring those who wanted to share subscriptions with people outside of their direct household to pay an additional fee. Password sharing restrictions <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/08/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-canada/">then expanded</a> to Canada, New Zealand, and some European countries in February 2023, before coming to the U.S., UK, and other countries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/24/netflix-starts-password-sharing-crackdown/">in May 2023</a>. The tiered rollout gave Netflix time to assess customer reaction. "It was good to take it slow," said Sarandos at today's event. "That's why we didn't do it in one fell swoop."<br/>
<br/>
Netflix allowed password sharing to proliferate for more than a decade before deciding to crack down on it. The change came because in the first quarter of 2022, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/18/netflix-password-sharing-latin-america/">Netflix lost subscribers</a> for the first time in 10 years and saw a sharp drop in revenue. To boost revenue, Netflix put a stop to password sharing, raised prices, and launched an ad-supported tier.<br/>
<br/>
According to Netflix, an estimated 222 million paying households were sharing with an additional 100 million households that were not being monetized.<br/>
<br/>
Following the password sharing crackdown, Netflix said that it saw strong subscriber growth in countries where password sharing was restricted. Netflix in Q2 2023 added six million subscribers, including more than a million in the U.S. and Canada. Revenue increased in every region where paid sharing was rolled out, and signups ultimately exceeded cancelations. In the third quarter of 2023, Netflix gained 8.8 million new subscribers, up from 2.4 million new subscribers in Q3 2022, plus revenue increased by &#36;64 million.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix subscribers are now only allowed to share accounts with people who live in the same household, with Netflix restricting access based on IP and other location data. "A Netflix account is meant to be shared by people who live together in one household," reads the Netflix website. "People who are not in your household will need to use their own account to watch Netflix."<br/>
<br/>
Along with removing password sharing, Netflix in October <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/netflix-price-increase-2023/">raised its prices in the United States</a>. The Basic no-ads plan is now priced at &#36;11.99 per month (a &#36;2 increase), while the Premium plan is &#36;22.99 per month (a &#36;3 increase). Netflix did not change the price of its &#36;6.99 ad-supported tier or its &#36;15.49/month Standard plan.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-pace/">Netflix &#039;Completely Satisfied&#039; With Pace of Password Sharing Crackdown</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-completely-satisfied-with-pace-of-password-sharing-crackdown.2412824/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<blockquote>Over the last two years, we've put significant emphasis on building Spotify into a truly great and sustainable business - one designed to achieve our goal of being the world's leading audio company and one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future. While we've made worthy strides, as I've shared many times, we still have work to do. Economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive. Spotify is not an exception to these realities.<br/>
<br/>
This brings me to a decision that will mean a significant step change for our company. To align Spotify with our future goals and ensure we are right-sized for the challenges ahead, I have made the difficult decision to reduce our total headcount by approximately 17% across the company.</blockquote><br/>
According to Ek, Spotify took on too many employees in 2020 and 2021, and while that led to increased output and company growth, it also made Spotify less efficient and increased operating costs. Spotify has too many people "dedicated to supporting work" and "doing work around the work" rather than "contributing to opportunities with real impact."<br/>
<br/>
Spotify employees that are impacted by layoffs will be notified by Tuesday, December 5. Severance will be based on tenure and local notice period requirements, with employees receiving an average of five months of severance.<br/>
<br/>
Going forward, Ek says that Spotify must be "relentlessly resourceful" in how it operates because "being lean is not just an option but a necessity." The cuts will let the company "build an even stronger Spotify" in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
In Q3 2023, Spotify brought in &#36;3.6 billion, up from &#36;3.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Spotify also added 23 million monthly active users and six million paid subscribers, leading to its first profitable quarter in 2023. Profit was only at one percent, however.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>'s main competitor, and the company has long protested the fees that Apple collects through its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek this year has been urging lawmakers in the United Kingdom <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/spotify-apple-uk-legislation/">to adopt a bill</a> that would regulate competition in digital markets and prevent Apple from offering a platform while also competing on that platform.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and Spotify's most recent tiff happened in late 2022 when Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/spotify-audio-book-app-update-rejected-apple/">rejected a Spotify app update</a> that added audiobook support. Spotify attempted to direct customers to buy books online to listen to in the app, which Apple protested. Spotify was ultimately forced to remove all in-app information about how to purchase an audiobook from the Spotify website to get the app approved.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/spotify-layoffs-december-2023/">Apple Music Competitor Spotify Lays Off Over 1,000 Employees</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-competitor-spotify-lays-off-over-1-000-employees.2412823/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With Apple and Goldman Sachs set to put an end to their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> agreement over the next 12 to 15 months, Chase Bank could be the ideal partner to step in and take over Goldman Sachs' role, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785924" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-card-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-03/apple-to-drop-goldman-sachs-for-apple-card-chase-bank-is-ideal-replacement-lppjbe7z">weekly PowerOn newsletter</a>, Gurman on Sunday said that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co already works with Apple on several financial initiatives, which is why Chase "makes more sense" than other &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; partners that have been proposed, such as American Express.<br/>
<br/>
Chase was an early <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> partner, is one of the banks that holds Apple's &#36;60 billion in cash, and works with Apple on an Ultimate Rewards program that provides discounts on Apple products to Chase customers. Right now, the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; is on the Mastercard platform, which is also used by Chase, so Apple would not need to swap over to Visa or American Express.<br/>
<br/>
When Apple was first seeking a partner for the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, Chase, American Express, and Citigroup all declined to work with Apple because it was not clear at the time if the endeavor would work out, but now that &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; has millions of users, banks that weren't previously interested may want to reconsider.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple does end up working with Chase, Gurman points out that the Apple Savings account might have to go or that Apple might have to find a different partner for it. Chase does not offer high-yield savings accounts that are on par with the 4.15 percent return rate that the Apple Savings account provides under Goldman Sachs.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors for months that Goldman Sachs wanted to get out of consumer banking and thus out of its partnership with Apple. <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> last week confirmed that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">will let Goldman Sachs</a> out of its deal, with Apple planning to stop working with Goldman Sachs in the next 12 to 15 months.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The &zwnj;Wall Street Journal&zwnj;</em> suggested that Apple could work with Synchrony Financial on the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, and prior rumors have said that Goldman Sachs approached American Express about taking over the partnership. It is not yet clear if Apple is already in talks with another bank, nor what the company's next steps will be. &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; service will continue on as normal as Apple works to find a new partner, and Apple has promised to continue to provide "the best tools and services" for &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; customers.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/goldman-sachs/">Goldman Sachs</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/gurman-chase-bank-is-ideal-partner-to-take-over-apple-card-deal/">Gurman: Chase Bank is &#039;Ideal Partner&#039; to Take Over Apple Card Deal</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-chase-bank-is-ideal-partner-to-take-over-apple-card-deal.2412817/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve Jobs memorabilia and remnants from Apple's early days tend to fetch high prices from collectors, and a check to RadioShack signed by Jobs is no exception. <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/348161106800099-steve-jobs-signed-apple-computer-company-check-to-radioshack-july-23-1976/">Up for auction</a> this week, the check is expected to fetch more than &#36;25,000.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/steve-jobs-check.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1062" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925189" /><br/>
The check, which is from Apple Computer Company, was filled out by Jobs on July 23, 1976. It is made out for &#36;4.01 and signed "Steven Jobs." The address on the check is the answering service and mail drop off point that Steve Jobs used while Apple was being run out of his parents' garage.<br/>
<blockquote>A fascinating check related to one of the great unsung heroes of the early computer boom: RadioShack. The biggest tech innovations of the 20th century are all, in varying degrees, indebted to the Boston-based electronics store. Steve Wozniak, who spent hours roaming the aisles of RadioShack as a teenager, saved up enough money to purchase their pioneering TRS-80 Micro Computer System, which he used to build his notorious 'blue box,' an illegal device that could make free long-distance phone calls. The 'blue box' cemented the first business partnership between Wozniak and Jobs, a duo that managed to make and sell roughly 200 of the boxes for &#36;150 each. Jobs later told his biographer that if it had not been for Wozniak's blue boxes, 'there wouldn't have been an Apple.' In other words: there wouldn't have been an Apple if it had not been for RadioShack.</blockquote>When the check was written, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were working on the Apple-1 computer. 50 of the machines were manufactured and sold to The Byte Shop in Mountain View, California, and approximately 200 Apple-1 computers were made in all.<br/>
<br/>
At the time of writing, there have been 21 bids on the check, and the total is up to &#36;22,444. The auction ends on December 6.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/steve-jobs/">Steve Jobs</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/steve-jobs-signed-radioshack-check-auction/">Apple Computer Check Signed by Steve Jobs Expected to Fetch More Than &#36;25,000 at Auction</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-computer-check-signed-by-steve-jobs-expected-to-fetch-more-than-25-000-at-auction.2412812/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
