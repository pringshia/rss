		<description><![CDATA[Apple announced three new devices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">during its "Scary Fast" event</a> on Monday, including updated 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac models, all with M3 series chips. Apple did not announce any other products during the 30-minute event, which was likely the company's final presentation this year.<br/>
<br/>

Below, our latest rumor report card provides a look at which rumors were right and wrong or a mix of both following Apple's event.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Accurate</h2><ul><li><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple would likely hold a Mac launch event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-mac-launch-event-coming-october-30-or-31/">on October 30 or October 31</a>.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman said the new 24-inch iMac would skip the M2 chip and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/next-gen-imac-details-rumored-ahead-of-event/">go right to the M3 chip</a>.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman revealed several accurate <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect">CPU core counts, GPU core counts, and RAM amounts</a> for the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips in the new MacBook Pro models.</li><br/>
<li>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-march-2024-launch/">both</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">ruled out new iPads</a> for the rest of 2023, and this event indeed lacked any iPad announcements.</li><br/>
<li>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/alleged-macbook-pro-box-image/">box for the new MacBook Pro leaked</a> on Chinese social media website Weibo.</li></ul><br/>
<h2>Inaccurate</h2><ul><li><em>MacRumors</em> discovered that an Apple supplier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/apple-scary-fast-event-battery-filings/">resubmitted a sixth-generation iPad mini battery filing</a> in a Chinese regulatory database last week, and speculated about the possibility of a seventh-generation iPad mini using the same battery being announced at the event, but this did not happen.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman reported that Apple would likely announce updated versions of the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad for the Mac <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">with USB-C ports for charging</a>, but the accessories are still equipped with Lightning.</li><br/>
<li>Japanese blog <em>Mac Otakara</em> believed that the next 24-inch iMac would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/imac-m2-and-m2-pro-rumor/">equipped with M2 and M2 Pro chips</a>, but it has the M3 chip.</li></ul><h2>Mixed</h2><ul><li>Kuo initially claimed that new MacBooks with M3 series chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">were unlikely to launch this year</a>, but he later reversed course and said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/">new MacBook Pro models with M3 series chips would be announced</a> at the event.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman initially claimed that new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models were on track to launch <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-15/apple-october-2023-executive-promotions-new-vps-of-retail-software-operations-lnrh4t94">in early to spring 2024</a>, but he later reversed course and said that the laptops would be announced at the event.</li><br/>
<li><em>MacRumors</em> published a report speculating that Apple's event would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-event-mac-gaming-focus-likely/">likely have an emphasis on high-end gaming on the Mac</a>. The new M3 series chips for the Mac do feature hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games, as the report mentioned, but the unconfirmed tip that we mentioned about the event having a Japanese developer tie-in was inaccurate.</li></ul><h2>Undetermined</h2><ul><li>Prior to the event, Kuo said the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">24-inch iMac would be updated in 2024</a>, but he did not explicitly rule out a new model in 2023.</li></ul><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/scary-fast-apple-event-rumor-report-card/">&#039;Scary Fast&#039; Rumor Report Card: New MacBook Pros and iMac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/scary-fast-rumor-report-card-new-macbook-pros-and-imac.2409441/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 16 Could Feature Extra Button, Relocated mmWave Antenna and Haptic Action Button</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models may be equipped with an extra button, according to <a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Weibo leaker Instant Digital</a>, who has shared accurate details on Apple's plans in the past. Instant Digital claims that there is a "great chance" of getting an additional button, with Apple also planning to relocate the mmWave antenna to the left of the device instead of the right to accommodate the change.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro Action Button will supposedly sit flush with the device, as Apple is expected to transition to solid-state technology for the button rather than the current standard button design.<br/>
<br/>
Though changes are expected to the Action Button, the volume keys and the power keys are said to remain the same with no changes. These buttons are not solid-state at the current time, though Apple's plans could change.<br/>
<br/>
The information shared by Instant Digital echoes details that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/"><em>MacRumors</em> published in late September</a> highlighting the extra button that is expected to come to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. Apple is calling this button the "Capture Button" internally, but it continues to be unclear what exactly it will be used for. The button will be located under the power button on the right side of the device, and it will be a capacitive button rather than a standard button.<br/>
<br/>
We also previously outlined the repositioning of the mmWave antenna to the space under the volume buttons, and the adoption of solid-state technology for the Action Button. Our sources have indicated that the new button is set to be introduced on all &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, including the base &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Setsuna Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/">iPhone 16 Could Feature Extra Button, Relocated mmWave Antenna and Haptic Action Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-could-feature-extra-button-relocated-mmwave-antenna-and-haptic-action-button.2409439/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fifth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that runs on the Vision Pro headset. The fourth beta <a href="hhttps://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-releases-visionos-beta-4/">came out in early October</a>, so it has been nearly a month since Apple last released a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people do not have access to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta outside of Xcode, and it is not entirely clear what Apple is adding in each &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update. Apple has said that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> will be coming to &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; soon, and it appears that it may be present in this fifth beta. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It looks like visionOS Beta 5 has the App Store! <a href="https://t.co/RIL9u9sBQB">pic.twitter.com/RIL9u9sBQB</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1719457938740248708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple is letting developers attend Vision Pro labs around the world, and developers who visit these locations are able to test the Vision Pro in person and get help from Apple engineers on their &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is not expected until early 2024, so Apple still has several months to refine the hardware and software.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/apple-releases-visionos-beta-5/">Apple&#039;s Work on visionOS Continues With Beta 5 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-work-on-visionos-continues-with-beta-5-launch.2409431/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a new firmware update designed for the AirTag item trackers. The firmware features a build number of 2A61, up from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/12/apple-releases-airtags-firmware-update-2a36/">the 2A36 firmware</a> that came out last December.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813264" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/AitTag-New-Firmware.jpg" alt="" width="2390" height="1344" /><br/>
It has been nearly a year since Apple updated the firmware on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>, and there is no word yet on what might be included in the update.<br/>
<br/>
Today's firmware release will be rolling out on a staggered basis. One percent of users will get the update today, and then it will expand to 10 percent of users on November 7. On November 14, an additional 25 percent of users will see the update, and then it will be available to all on November 28.<br/>
<br/>
It is not possible to force an AirTag update, as it's something that's done over-the-air through a connected <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device. You can check your current AirTag firmware version through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> app, with instructions <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-airtags-firmware-version/">available in our how to</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232">AirTags</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/airtags-firmware-update/">Apple Releases New Firmware for AirTags</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-airtags.2409423/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">announced on Monday</a> are available <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-unveils-new-space-black-color-for-m3-pro-and-m3-max-macbook-pro/">in a new Space Black finish</a> when configured with M3 Pro or M3 Max chips. Notably, Apple says this finish features an "anodization seal" to "greatly reduce fingerprints."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Toms-Guide-Space-Black-MacBook-Pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919950" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Space Black MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-pro-16-inch-m3-2023">via Tom's Guide</a></em></div><br/>
Apple already made the MacBook Air available in a darker Midnight finish, and it is considered by many to be a fingerprint magnet. Based on hands-on videos of the new MacBook Pro models shared following Apple's event, the new anti-fingerprint seal does appear to be an improvement compared to the MacBook Air, but more testing is needed.<br/>
<br/>
In the hands-on video below, <em>The Verge</em>'s Dan Seifert said "I got like 30 seconds to touch the new Space Black model, and yeah, I guess there are fewer fingerprints on it, but we'll really have to see how it holds up in the real world."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUyKtOj3cks?si=Eeti2Ez1O_1XqrH2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/a-magic-number-new-macbook-pros-and-imacs-usher-in-the-m3-era/"><em>Six Colors</em> editor-in-chief Jason Snell said</a> the Space Black finish is "generally more resistant to fingerprints," but he said some fingerprints are still to be expected. He also said Space Black is more like a "dark gray" instead of actual black:<blockquote>I got my greasy monkey paws on a Space Black laptop and can report that Apple's as good as its word in the sense that it seems generally more resistant to fingerprints and other smudges.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't want to exaggerate this feature: you can still see fingerprints. They just aren't as prominent. This is a progressive improvement over something like the Midnight M2 MacBook Air, but it's not a cure-all.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, I need to warn you not to get too excited about Apple finally making a black MacBook Pro. Space Black is not actually as black as space. It's a dark gray. Yes, it's appreciably darker than the Space Gray on the current MacBook Pros (and the new base model), but it's still a shimmery metallic gray. Fans of Darth Vader stand down.</blockquote>Another hands-on video from Brian Tong:<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-RhNLERfLE?si=ebV-C8JDICR9rYrA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2023/10/30/apple-reveals-new-m3-chip-powered-macbook-pro-line/"><em>MobileSyrup</em>'s Patrick O'Rourke</a> said "I have very greasy fingers and spent several minutes in the hands-on area trying to smudge the 'Space Black' colour — I couldn't."<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/hands-on-with-the-apple-m3-macbook-pro-1850976095"><em>Gizmodo</em>'s Kyle Barr</a> said "I did have the chance to put my grubby hands on the newest M3-powered MacBook Pros, and while I didn't see many leftover smears on the surface, it didn't take long for Apple staff to swoop in with microfiber cloth in hand to remove any wayward stains," so testing will be needed outside of a controlled environment.<br/>

<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hands-on-apple-m3-macs/"><em>XDA</em>'s Brady Snyder</a> on Space Black and fingerprints:<blockquote>Though the changes to the M3 MacBook Pro were mostly internal, there's a new color called Space Black. It looks better in person than it did in Apple's unveiling, but it's still not black. I'd compare it to the black color of the iPhone 5 or the iPad mini 2. It's still nowhere near the black color we saw on the polycarbonate MacBooks in the mid-2000s. As you can see in the photos below, this MacBook can look lighter and darker based on lighting conditions, much like Apple's Midnight colorway. However, compared to that color, the MacBook Pro does seem to be less of a fingerprint magnet.</blockquote>The new MacBook Pro models are available to order now, and most configurations will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7. Configurations with the M3 Max chip launch later in November.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/">Space Black MacBook Pro With Anti-Fingerprint Seal Revealed in First Hands-On Videos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/space-black-macbook-pro-with-anti-fingerprint-seal-revealed-in-first-hands-on-videos.2409421/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/">shared a behind-the-scenes look</a> at the video production of its recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">"Scary Fast" M3 MacBook Pro event</a>, which was shot entirely on iPhone 15 Pro Max and edited on Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3dbG9pAi8I?si=x-T5g9jOpAsQEse4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Titled "Behind the Scenes: An Apple Event" and running two minutes and 16 seconds, the video shared on YouTube reveals how footage was captured using multiple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices, with the production team utilizing integration between iPhone 15 Pro, the Blackmagic Camera app, and Tentacle Sync.<br/>
<br/>
Connected via Bluetooth, Tentacle Sync drives timecode and enables all devices on set — including Macs and preview screens — to be synced throughout the production. Beastgrip accessories, including cages and rigs, were also used during the production, as well as cranes, dollies, gimbals, and drones. <br/>
<br/>
Interview clips with the directors, producers, and editors explain how the capabilities of the iPhone 15 Pro allowed them to work effectively with low light conditions, which is traditionally a bit more challenging for a standard video camera. <br/>
<br/>
The production was advised by Apple's Jon Carr, a Pro Workflow video specialist whose credits include <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> and <em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em>, and Jeff Wozniak, who has worked on productions including <em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>Iron Man 2</em>.<br/>
<blockquote>"When I first got the footage from iPhone 15 Pro Max, I was immediately pleasantly surprised," said Stefan Sonnenfeld, Company 3's CEO, who colored the presentation and has worked on projects including Stranger Things, The Equalizer 3, and Fast X. "The quality of the image on iPhone 15 Pro Max is incredible, and it's there. And I know because I've done it and I've seen it, and we're doing this project with it."</blockquote><br/>
The video specialists also espoused the benefits of being able to shoot directly to external storage and use Apple Log to access more dynamic range in post production.<br/>
<br/>
The ‌‌iPhone 15‌ Pro‌ and iPhone 15 Pro Max models feature an improved camera system, including a main camera with a larger sensor, a new coating to reduce lens flare, optical image stabilization, and better low light performance for Portraits and Night mode.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shot-on-iphone/">Shot on iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/apple-video-scary-fast-event-shot-iphone-15-pro/">Apple Reveals How &#039;Scary Fast&#039; Event Was Shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reveals-how-scary-fast-event-was-shot-on-iphone-15-pro-max.2409406/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Chrome users on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> can now opt to move the Chrome address bar to the bottom of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display, mirroring a design change that Apple implemented in Safari last year.<br/>

Chrome for iOS can be customized to have the URL bar at the top or the bottom of the interface depending on where the user prefers it to be. Google says this is a feature that Chrome users have been requesting for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
To move the Chrome address bar, long press on it and then choose the "Move address bar to the bottom" option. Users can also navigate to the Settings menu and choose "address bar" to change the bar's position.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome-for-ios/">Chrome for iOS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/chrome-ios-address-bar-reposition/">Google Chrome for iOS Now Lets You Move URL Bar to Bottom of iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-chrome-for-ios-now-lets-you-move-url-bar-to-bottom-of-iphone.2409404/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At its "Scary Fast" event, Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">new 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac models</a> with M3 series chips. It was a very quick and tidy 30-minute event, with no other products or surprises revealed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Event-October-2023.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919098" /><br/>
Below, we have listed some rumored products that were not announced at the event.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Magic Accessories With USB-C</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-Magic-Keyboard-and-Mouse.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919840" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that Apple's event would likely include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">updated versions of the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad</a> for the Mac with USB-C ports for charging, but the accessories are still equipped with Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPads</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPad-mini-6-orange-BG.jpg" alt="" width="1881" height="1058" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816576" /><br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Gurman both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">ruled out new iPads</a> for the rest of 2023, and this event indeed lacked any iPad announcements.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> had discovered that an Apple supplier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/apple-scary-fast-event-battery-filings/">resubmitted</a> a sixth-generation iPad mini battery filing in a Chinese regulatory database last week, but this ultimately did not relate to a seventh-generation iPad mini at the event.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said Apple does not plan to introduce new iPads <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-march-2024-launch/">until March 2024 or later</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iMac Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
While the Intel-based iMac Pro was discontinued in 2021, there have been rumors about an eventual Apple silicon replacement ever since.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Gurman said Apple still has plans to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">larger pro version of the iMac with a 32-inch display</a> in either late 2024 or in 2025. It's unclear which chips this Mac would be equipped with. On a speculative basis, it could use the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips announced yesterday, or perhaps even an upcoming M3 Ultra chip, but Apple might be on to the M4 series of chips by time the new iMac Pro is announced.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the new iMac Pro will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">feature mini-LED backlighting</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Air and Mac Mini</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898577" /><br/>
To be clear, new MacBook Air and Mac mini models were not expected to be announced at this event, but they are worth mentioning given that they will likely use the same M3 or M3 Pro chips that were announced yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman expects updated 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the standard M3 chip to be released <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect">in the first half of 2024</a>. He also said Apple is already working on a new Mac mini, but he did not provide a launch timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPower</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/09/airpower.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="448" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-587742" /><br/>

There are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset. Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Just over seven years after it was introduced, the Touch Bar has now been fully discontinued on all new MacBooks sold by Apple, marking the end of an era for a hardware feature that was loved by some users and derided by others.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Touch-Bar-13-Inch-MacBook-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1364" height="769" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853221" /><br/>
The first MacBook Pro models with the Touch Bar were released in October 2016, as part of a controversial redesign that also included a defective butterfly keyboard and the removal of many ports, including an SD card slot, HDMI, and MagSafe. Physical function and Esc keys were also removed in favor of the Touch Bar.<br/>
<br/>
Apple initially <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/10/apple-unveils-groundbreaking-new-macbook-pro/">described</a> the Touch Bar as a "revolutionary" and "breakthrough" interface, but it was clearly not popular enough to stick around.<br/>
<br/>
It was a slow death for the Touch Bar:<ul><li>In 2019, Apple released the first 16-inch MacBook Pro with a physical Esc key, but the Touch Bar lived on in place of physical function keys.</li><br/>
<li>In 2021, Apple removed the Touch Bar from higher-end MacBook Pro models, switching back to full-size physical function keys.</li><br/>
<li>This week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro</a>, the final model with a Touch Bar.</li></ul>For now, the Touch Bar can still be found on some <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/13-inch-macbook-pro">refurbished models</a> sold by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible that the Touch Bar could return at some point in the future, especially if the 13-inch MacBook Pro is ever re-released as a lower-cost model, but at this point there is no firm evidence to suggest this will happen.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-bar/">Touch Bar</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/">Touch Bar Fully Discontinued on New MacBooks After Seven Years</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/touch-bar-fully-discontinued-on-new-macbooks-after-seven-years.2409371/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/m3-macbook-pro-and-imac-orders-available/">M3 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> features two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, not three Thunderbolt 4 ports like the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by M3 Pro and M3 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-m3pro-max-ports.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919715" /><br/>
Apart from having fewer USB-C ports, the lack of Thunderbolt 4 support on the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the base M3 chip means it only supports one display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz, or one display with up to 4K resolution at 120Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
In comparison, like the M2 Pro chip it replaces, the M3 Pro supports up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt. The M3 Pro-powered MacBook Pro models also support one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the M3 Max supports up to four external displays in the following configuration: Up to three external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI. <br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, M3 Max MacBook Pro models can support up to three external displays by connecting two displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz, or one display with 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, both the M3 Pro and M3 Max also support native DisplayPort over USB-C, and one display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are available to order now, and they will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest M3 Pro chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> has 25% less memory bandwidth than the M1 Pro and M2 Pro chips used in equivalent models from the two previous generations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-pro-chip.jpg" alt="" width="5104" height="2868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919649" /><br/>
Based on the latest 3-nanometer technology and featuring all-new GPU architecture, the M3 series of chips is said to represent the fastest and most power-efficient evolution of Apple silicon thus far. For example, the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro chip is up to 40% faster than the 16-inch model with M1 Pro, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
However, looking at Apple's own hardware specifications, the M3 Pro system on a chip (SoC) features 150GB/s memory bandwidth, compared to 200GB/s on the earlier M1 Pro and M2 Pro. As for the M3 Max, Apple says it is capable of "up to 400GB/s." This wording is because the less pricey scaled-down M3 Max with 14-core CPU and 30-core GPU has only 300GB/s of memory bandwidth, whereas the equivalent scaled-down M2 Max with 12-core CPU and 30-core GPU featured 400GB/s bandwidth, just like its more powerful 12‑core CPU, 38‑core GPU version.  <br/>
<br/>
Notably, Apple has also changed the core ratios of the higher-tier M3 Pro chip compared to its direct predecessor. The M3 Pro with 12-core CPU has 6 performance cores (versus 8 performance cores on the 12-core M2 Pro) and 6 efficiency cores (versus 4 efficiency cores on the 12-core M2 Pro), while the GPU has 18 cores (versus 19 on the equivalent M2 Pro chip). <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, while the M3 chip's 16-core Neural Engine has the same number of cores as the one Apple featured in the 3nm-based A17 Pro chip that debuted in the iPhone 15 Pro series in September, it's comparatively weaker on paper in terms of maximum achievable throughput, which is measured in trillions of operations per second (TOPS). <br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, the M3 Neural Engine is capable of 18 TOPS, whereas the A17 Pro Neural Engine is capable of 35 TOPS. It's hard to say for certain, but it is possible that the iPhone 15 Pro requires a higher performing Neural Engine for features like computational photography and Face ID, whereas the M3 can compensate in other areas like machine learning by utilizing its additional GPU cores.<br/>
<br/>
Taken together, it's presently unclear what real-world difference these changes make to M3 performance when pitted against Apple's equivalent precursor chips in various usage scenarios, especially given that the latest processors include new Dynamic Caching memory allocation technology which ensures that only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-pro-soc.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1903" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919672" /><br/>
This opaqueness is not helped by the fact that Apple advertises the power of the new M3 Pro and M3 Max chips by repeatedly emphasizing comparisons to the M1 Pro and M1 Max, rather than the more recent M2 variants, against which performance gains appear more modest. Hopefully we will learn more in time when the first thoroughgoing third-party benchmarks become available.<br/>

Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/">tech specs</a> for the laptops indicate that all of the latest 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models provide up to 600 nits of peak brightness for SDR content, which is a 20% increase over the 500 nits maximum on the previous models. For HDR content, all of the models can achieve peak brightness of up to 1,600 nits, which is unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
"The Liquid Retina XDR display is the world's best laptop display, with an exceptional 1000 nits sustained and 1600 nits of peak brightness for HDR content, impressive contrast ratio, vivid colors, and an outstanding viewing angle," said Apple. "SDR content is now displayed at up to 600 nits, which is 20 percent brighter than before."<br/>
