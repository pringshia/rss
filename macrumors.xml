		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.opera.com/browsers/opera/ios">Opera</a> has released its artificial intelligence-powered Opera One browser for iOS, following several weeks in beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/opera-one-browser.jpeg" alt="" width="2732" height="1356" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961526" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> app mimics the minimalist aesthetic of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/opera-one-browser-ai-launches/">company's desktop browser</a>, and "intelligently hides unnecessary elements" to make the browsing experience free from distractions. When scrolling on a page, for example, the browser hides the bottom and the top bar for a full-screen view.<br/>
<br/>
The search bar sits at the bottom of the interface for easier access, provides quick search suggestions while typing, and includes Aria AI assistant integration. There's also a new swipe-to-search gesture  that lets users activate the search bar with a simple swipe down, similar to when users search for apps from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> via Spotlight. The placed search bar is the default option, but users can alternatively choose Standard Navigation or Fast Action Button style.<br/>
<br/>
Aria can assist with a wide range of tasks, from web searches to generating text and images, according to Opera. With Voice Input, Aria allows users to speak queries instead of typing them, making it convenient when on the move or in need of hands-free operation. Aria can also create images using Google's Imagen2 model, enabling users to generate visuals simply by providing a prompt.  <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlGwGZ_jYp8?si=6nAat6yG00YezCcx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Additionally, there's a new start page carousel that is designed to keep users informed without cluttering up the interface, integrating news, live scores, and product tips into the wallpaper background. Opera also includes a built-in ad blocker, a free VPN service, and several theme customization options.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.opera.com/browsers/opera/ios">Opera One for iOS</a> comes just over a year after its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/opera-one-browser-ai-launches/">debut on desktop</a>, and can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for free [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/opera-ai-browser-with-vpn/id1411869974">Direct Link</a>]. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/opera-browser/">Opera Browser</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/opera-one-browser-launches-ios-aria-ai-integration/">Opera One Browser Launches on iOS With Aria AI Integration, Voice Input, Image Generation, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/opera-one-browser-launches-on-ios-with-aria-ai-integration-voice-input-image-generation-and-more.2433533/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Likely Won&#039;t Charge for Apple Intelligence Features Until At Least 2027</title>

		<description><![CDATA[It will likely be years before Apple Intelligence has a compelling enough feature set that people will pay for, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said in this week's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">Power On newsletter</a>. Apple Intelligence is still so new that Gurman expects it will "take three years" for Apple to create a product that's worth charging for, and even that "may be the best-case scenario."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960229" /><br/>
Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/apple-intelligence-subscription-price/">suggested last month</a> that Apple's long-term plan is to develop something like Apple Intelligence+, with add-on features that users would pay a monthly fee to access. Apple already has a tiered subscription setup for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, so Apple Intelligence could work similar to that.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; provides 5GB of free storage to all users, but for a fee, &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ subscription plans include more storage and also access to features like &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay. In the future, basic Apple Intelligence access could continue to be free, with more advanced features requiring a subscription. OpenAI and other companies charge for AI queries and image generation after a set free limit due to the computing power and costs associated with AI.<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, the first Apple Intelligence features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">are only partially available</a> in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 betas. Apple has added Writing Tools, some basic <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> improvements, smart replies in Messages and Mail, and a few other features like a Memory Maker option in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, but Image Playground, Genmoji, and the bulk of the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; upgrades <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/">won't be coming until later</a> in 2024 and 2025.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to fully rolling out the first Apple Intelligence features that were announced at WWDC 2024, Apple still needs to work to expand the functionality to more countries, including China and the European Union. The features that Apple showed off in June likely won't all be available until 2025, and there's no word yet on when it might expand to more countries (including other languages), so it's not hard to see how it could take until 2027 or beyond to have a robust product.<br/>
<br/>
As another reference point, Apple introduced Emergency SOS via satellite alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> in 2022, a feature that the company plans to eventually charge a fee to use, but it will be at least 2025 before the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners have to pay for it. Apple's fee for Emergency SOS has not yet been announced.<br/>
<br/>
When Apple does start charging for Apple Intelligence, it could be baked into existing &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ plans or included as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a>, Apple's subscription bundle. Counterpoint Research analyst Neil Shah recently speculated that Apple could charge between &#36;10 and &#36;20 for Apple Intelligence, with the fee rolled into an &zwnj;Apple One&zwnj; plan. The basic &zwnj;Apple One&zwnj; plan is priced at &#36;19.95 per month right now, and it includes 50GB &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ storage, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-intelligence-fees-2027/">Apple Likely Won&#039;t Charge for Apple Intelligence Features Until At Least 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-wont-charge-for-apple-intelligence-features-until-at-least-2027.2433504/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is beta testing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and the first update to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; concurrently, and we got the second betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 today alongside the sixth betas of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" /><br/>
Many of the changes in iOS 18.1 are focused on bringing the .1 betas in line with the standard betas, which recently received updates to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> and Safari, while updates in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; are to finalize features and prepare it for launch.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Photos Redesign (iOS 18.1)</h2><br/>
The redesigned &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; has proven to be not so popular with some users, so Apple streamlined it ahead of launch. The all-in-one design remains, but Apple removed the carousel to make the app less confusing and less repetitive. Apple introduced these design changes in the standard &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; update last week, and has now brought them to iOS 18.1.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-photos-app-redesign.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960811" /><br/>
With prior versions of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, you could swipe left to right to get to various Collections, but now Collections are accessed solely by scrolling down from the main library view. Collections include your custom albums and content that was previously in the For You section, such as featured images, videos, favorites, memories, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The Photo Library now displays more images at once in the photos grid, and Apple moved albums higher by default to make it easier for users to get to them. Recently Saved content has been integrated into Recent Days, so it's simpler to find too.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Distraction Control in Safari (iOS 18.1)</h2><br/>
Distraction Control is a new Safari option that lets you hide distracting elements from webpages and articles. You can use the feature to get rid of sign-in windows, cookie preference popups, newsletter signup videos, GDPR banners, and autoplay videos, among other things.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-distraction-control.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960812" /><br/>
What you can't use Distraction Control for is hiding ads. Apple has been clear that Distraction Control is not an ad removing tool, and while you can temporarily hide an ad, it pops right back when the ad or webpage refreshes. Distraction Control is designed for <em>static</em> content, not dynamic content, so anything that refreshes can't be hidden from view.<br/>
<br/>
You can get to Distraction Control by opening up Safari, selecting the page settings, and tapping on Hide Distracting Items. From there, you can tap on an element on the page that you want to hide from view. If you're not seeing the Hide Distracting Items option, tap on the three dots in the settings and then choose Edit and you'll be able to add it to your quick access options.<br/>
<br/>
What you've hidden will remain blocked from view as long as it's not dynamic content, but you can restore a webpage to default by going into the same options and tapping on Show Hidden Items.<br/>
<br/>
Note that if you hide a cookie banner or GDPR popup, it is the same as closing the banner without submitting your website preferences. Distraction Control settings are on-device and will not sync from one device to another, so you will need to set it up on each of your devices.<br/>
<br/>
Distraction Control was added to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; last week, and now the feature is also in the .1 betas.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Photo App Collection (iOS 18 Beta 6)</h2><br/>
Apple has further tweaked the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 6, introducing a redesigned look for the Albums Collection. Each album has a separate card, with a main thumbnail on the left. Prior versions had the album name on the left and a collection of small thumbnails.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-beta-6-photos-app-updates.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961512" /><br/>
<h2>Control Center (All Betas)</h2><br/>
In Control Center, there is a new toggle for turning Bluetooth on and off. It is separate from the general communication controls that are all lumped together, and it can be added to any Control Center page.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-beta-6-control-center.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961513" /><br/>
You can also add the Bluetooth toggle to the Lock Screen in place of the Camera or the Flashlight or assign it to the Action Button on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
There have been some tweaks to the way Control Center icons are organized in the gallery. A "Capture" section, for example, has Camera, Scan QR Code, and Magnifier options, and Silent Mode has been added under Sounds.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Dark Mode Notification Icons (All Betas)</h2><br/>
When you have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a> icons turned on, notifications that you receive from apps with a &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; icon will show with that icon properly rather than showing with the Light Mode icon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-dark-mode-notifications.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961514" /><br/>
Note that in iOS 18.1 beta 2, both &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; and &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; icons need to be turned on for notifications to have the darker icon. In &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 6, dark mode icons will show up with the darker icons turned on. &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; is not required. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Splash Screens (All Betas)</h2><br/>
As Apple prepares for the launch of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, there are new splash screens for &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, Translate, Podcasts, Home, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, Calculator, and Notes. The addition of splash screens suggests that we are nearing the end of planned changes for the base version of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, which will be installed on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-splash-screens.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961515" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Localization (iOS 18.1)</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence includes new localized versions of English in the second 18.1 beta. Options include Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and Singapore, which are in addition to the previous U.S., UK, and Australia localization options.<br/>
<br/>
No support for non-English languages has been added at this time, and Apple says that support for other languages will come later this year and in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence in EU (iOS 18.1)</h2><br/>
Multiple people located in the European Union have been able to turn on and use Apple Intelligence by setting their region to the United States and language to U.S. English.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Icon Tints (All Betas)</h2><br/>
Tints that you apply to your icons to match wallpapers are now linked to that wallpaper rather than the system. When you change your wallpaper, your icons will change as well if you've tailored them to be tinted to a wallpaper color.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-tinted-icons-wallpapers.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961516" /><br/>
<h2>Apple Music (All Betas)</h2><br/>
The Browse tab in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> is now the "New" tab.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-6-music-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961517" /><br/>
<h2>Lock Screen (iOS 18.1)</h2><br/>
There is no longer an option to get to Spotlight search by swiping down from the Lock Screen in iOS 18.1 beta 2, but this may be a bug.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mail - Upgrade Warning</h2><br/>
Apple says that developers who have &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 5 and who are thinking of upgrading to the iOS 18.1 beta might have all their mail redownloaded.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15 and 15.1 betas that Apple provided to developers today officially introduce new &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; wallpapers that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/macos-sequoia-forest-wallpaper-hidden/">first popped up</a> last week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macos-sequoia-wallpaper-night.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961503" /><br/>
The wallpapers feature the sequoia trees that &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; is named for. The imagery likely comes from Sequoia National Park, located in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains of California. There are three separate versions of the wallpaper for different times of day: Sequoia Sunrise, Sequoia Morning, and Sequoia Night.<br/>
<br/>
Each wallpaper is animated and will shift slightly at the Lock Screen when you unlock your Mac, plus there is an option to set it as a screen saver.<br/>
<br/>
You will need the latest &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; betas to see the official wallpapers, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/macos-sequoia-forest-wallpaper-hidden/">downloadable versions</a> are available on other machines. The Sequoia wallpapers will be available to all &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; users when the operating system is released this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/macos-sequoia-beta-new-wallpapers/">Latest macOS Sequoia Betas Add New Wallpapers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-macos-sequoia-betas-add-new-wallpapers.2433483/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a third beta firmware for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, including both the Lightning and USB-C versions. The updated firmware has a build number of 7A5266c, up from 7A5244b, and it is available to developers at the current time. This is the third firmware update that Apple has released since announcing new &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 features in June.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803705" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/AirPods-Pro-Beta-Firmware.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" /><br/>
There are multiple features that are coming to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and these features are included in the firmware update.<br/>
<br/>
With head gestures, users can control <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; with a shake or a nod of the head. If you get a phone call, for example, you can shake your head no if you don't want to answer it, or nod to accept the call. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interactions can be used for responding to incoming messages, calls, and notifications.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is adding Voice Isolation to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; to cut down on loud background sounds to make you easier to hear, and there is a new Personalized Spatial Audio feature specific to gaming. Game developers will be able to incorporate spatial audio into their games for a more immersive audio experience.<br/>
<br/>
The new firmware requires a device running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; to install, and it won't be available to the public until this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/airpods-pro-beta-firmware-3-ios-18/">Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 Beta Firmware With Support for iOS 18 Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware-with-support-for-ios-18-features.2433479/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today provided developers with the second betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 to continue testing Apple Intelligence features. The second betas come two weeks after Apple seeded the first iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 betas.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960229" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
A device capable of supporting Apple Intelligence is required to download the updates, which includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and Pro Max, Apple silicon iPads, and Apple silicon Macs. The updates can be downloaded from the Settings app on a compatible device, with developers able to choose between the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>/<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>/&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15 betas or the .1 betas with Apple Intelligence functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence includes Writing Tools that are available wherever text can be selected and edited, and it can be used for spell checking, fixing grammar, rewriting with a new tone, and summarizing text.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> has a new design with a subtle glow around the display, and there is a Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; feature so you don't have to speak to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can follow along if you stumble over your words, and can maintain context between requests. Safari can summarize articles, and there's a new Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode.<br/>
<br/>
Smart replies are available in Messages and Mail, plus the Mail app surfaces time sensitive messages and puts them at the top of your inbox. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> has a Memory Movie feature for creating slideshows based on text descriptions, and you can record, transcribe, and summarize phone calls. Transcription and summarization are also available for any audio recording.<br/>
<br/>
More on all of the features that are available in the betas right now can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">found in our Apple Intelligence guide</a>. Image Playground, Genmoji, and other new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/">have not yet been implemented</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has split Apple Intelligence into a separate set of betas because these features will not be available in the initial launch versions of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;. Apple Intelligence will be available to the public later in the fall after a developer testing period.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-ios-18-1-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Developer Betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 With Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-developer-betas-of-ios-18-1-ipados-18-1-and-macos-sequoia-15-1-with-apple-intelligence.2433468/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the sixth betas of upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-5-to-developers/">release of the fifth betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;‌ Developer Beta setting. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta. The &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; beta track is now separate from the iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 beta track, with the .1 betas adding support for Apple Intelligence on devices that are able to run the features. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, a set of AI features that are built deeply into the operating system. Apple Intelligence won't be coming until later in the beta testing process, but it includes features for refining and editing writing, generating images and emoji, and most notably, improving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and search. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is gaining a better understanding of natural language, improved contextual awareness, and the personal assistant will integrate with ChatGPT to answer more complex queries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads with an M-series chip, but there are a number of other features that are coming. Apple is allowing users to rearrange Home screen apps to have open spaces, plus there's a dark mode for app icons and tinting options.<br/>
<br/>
The Control Center is customizable and third-party developers can add controls for their apps, with the Lock Screen Flashlight and Camera icons able to be replaced or removed. Messages is gaining Rich Communication Services support to improve conversations with Android users, the option to schedule texts to be sent later, new text effects, messages over satellite when there's no cellular, and the option to use any emoji for Tapback responses.<br/>
<br/>
There's a dedicated Passwords app for logins, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes, and there's now an option to lock and hide apps, which means they can't be opened without secondary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication even when your phone is unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
Safari has a highlights feature that summarizes articles and surfaces key information on websites, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app interface has been overhauled, and there's a new Tap to Cash feature for privately and securely transferring money using Apple Cash. Other features include equation solving and voice memo transcription in Notes, a game mode for improving game performance, and an option to respond to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on AirPods with head gestures.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will release &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; to the public this fall. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-6-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Sixth Betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to Developers [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-betas-of-ios-18-and-ipados-18-to-developers-update-public-beta-available.2433467/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the sixth beta of upcoming an upcoming macOS 15 Sequoia update to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-5-to-developers/">release of the fifth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macOS-Sequoia-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955370" /><br/>
Registered developers can opt-in to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, which allows you to control your locked &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from your Mac. You can open and use &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps, interact with notifications, and drag and drop files between your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Mac and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
There are new options for window tiling, and dragging a window to the edge of the display will suggest a tiled location to make it easier to use multiple apps at once. Apple is adding a Passwords app for managing passwords, Safari can summarize websites, surface key information, and Notes has support for live audio transcription and math equations.<br/>
<br/>
All of the Apple Intelligence features coming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will also be available in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, but Apple does not plan to add these until later in the beta testing process. Apple Intelligence includes Writing Tools for editing, proofreading, and summarizing text in apps, and an Image Playground allows for AI images to be created from prompts.<br/>
<br/>
Custom emoji or "Genmoji" can be created for any situation and used just like emoji, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is getting much smarter. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do more in apps and will better understand requests, especially those made in regard to on-screen content.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-6/">Apple Seeds Sixth Beta of macOS Sequoia to Developers [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-beta-of-macos-sequoia-to-developers-update-public-beta-available.2433471/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchOS-11-Thumb-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955941" /><br/>
To install the ‌&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; introduces a new Vitals app that aggregates health metrics collected during sleep like heart rate and respiratory rate, providing day-to-day health insights to track whether something has changed. There's also a Training Load feature for monitoring the intensity of workouts and how that impacts the body over time.<br/>
<br/>
The Smart Stack has been updated with new widgets and support for Live Activities and Translate, plus it is better able to suggest widgets based on time and daily routine. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> watch face includes suggestions for the best images to use, and the Check In safety feature now works with Workouts.<br/>
<br/>
Activity Rings can be customized to change the goals for each day, and there is an option to pause for rest days or when ill without losing an activity streak. Double Tap now works for navigating through apps with one hand, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> lets users create their own walking and hiking routes.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-watchos-11-beta-6-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Sixth Beta of watchOS 11 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-beta-of-watchos-11-to-developers.2433472/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the sixth beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> update to developers, with the beta coming a week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-5-to-developers/">after the fifth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; is able to take the depth information from 2D photos and turn them into 3D photos using advanced machine learning. Apple says that the feature is meant to add depth to photos to make memories more immersive.<br/>
<br/>
There are new hand gestures for activating the Home View and Control Center, and the Home View is also now customizable with apps able to be rearranged. Travel Mode now includes support for trains, and Guest User profiles are now saved for 30 days so guests don't have to do the setup process every time they try out the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the year, Mac Virtual Display will support higher resolution and larger sized virtual displays, which Apple says will be equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. With an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> update, the Vision Pro can serve as an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; receiver, so content from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac can be shared to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Mindfulness app can track and respond to breathing patterns using the camera for an improved meditation experience, and the Vision Pro supports Bluetooth mice with &zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-6-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Sixth visionOS 2 Beta to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-visionos-2-beta-to-developers.2433475/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 18 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 18 adds an InSight feature to the TV app, and it is able to provide real-time information about actors, music, and more in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> shows and music. Enhanced Dialogue has been refined with machine learning and computational audio so it is better able to boost vocal clarity over background noise and music, plus it is now available on built-in TV speakers, AirPods, and other Bluetooth devices.<br/>
<br/>
Subtitles will now show up automatically when relevant, such as when the TV's volume is muted, a show or movie is rewound, or when the language of a show doesn't match the device language.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include 21:9 aspect ratio support for projectors, new screen savers and improved controls for swapping screen savers, and support for Live Captions during <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls through an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-6-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Sixth Beta of tvOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-beta-of-tvos-18-to-developers.2433473/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Patreon today <a href="https://news.patreon.com/articles/understanding-apple-requirements-for-patreon">confirmed upcoming changes</a> to its iOS app, which will see fees for new subscriptions go up because Apple is enforcing its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules on digital purchases. Apple is requiring Patreon to adopt the in-app purchase system, a process that Patreon started at the beginning of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/patreon-app-store-fees.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961490" /><br/>
In January 2024, Patreon started using in-app purchases and paying Apple a 30 percent fee on digital products, but beginning in November, new Patreon memberships will also need to be done through in-app purchase and will be subject to the fee as well. Right now, when you subscribe to a creator through Patreon, Patreon directs you to a purchase flow that skirts built-in &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; payments, and Apple does not take a 30 percent cut.<br/>
<br/>
To account for the 30 percent fee that Apple will collect, Patreon will give creators the option to either increase their prices just in the iOS app, or absorb the fee themselves, keeping prices the same across platforms. The changes to Patreon payments will only affect new memberships purchased through an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> from November onwards, and not existing subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
Patreon says that the increased subscription fee will be the default option, and that it does not recommend that creators opt to absorb the fee themselves.<br/>
<blockquote>That said, you deserve the chance to decide whether that's something you want. So, while the automatic price increase is the default option, you also have the choice to keep your prices the same and pay the 30% fee from your earnings. We don't recommend this, because it means you'd earn less per membership on in-app iOS transactions - but ultimately we believe it's important to give you agency to make your own decisions.</blockquote><br/>
Apple will collect a 30 percent &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fee for all new memberships purchased via Patreon for iOS and for other digital goods purchased from a Patreon shop, and creators that use first-of-the-month billing or per-creation billing plans will need to swap to subscription billing for their iOS supporters because the in-app purchase system does not support the other flexible payment types.<br/>
<br/>
Per-creation billing allows Patreon members to pay their membership amount for each paid post a creator makes, with a monthly maximum. First-of-the-month billing comes into play with subscription models where a creator allows an upfront fee to unlock a backlog of content, with future payments made on the first of the month.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the limitations of in-app purchase subscriptions, Patreon is transitioning all of its creators to subscription billing, a process that it plans to complete by November 2025. Creators that already use the subscription model do not need to make changes, but creators using other methods will need to update.<br/>
<br/>
Patreon says that if it does not adopt the in-app purchase system for all iOS transactions, it risks being kicked out of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. As fees are not changing on other platforms such as the web and the Android app, Patreon suggests that creators send their fans to the <a href="https://support.patreon.com/hc/articles/27992185537037-How-iOS-in-app-purchases-works-for-fans">Patreon Help Center article</a> to explain the iOS fees compared to the fees on other platforms, so customers can "better understand the implications of where they choose to make their purchases."<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that Apple's 30 percent cut of Patreon subscriptions will be higher than the amount that Patreon keeps from creators. Patreon keeps between 8% and 12% of paid membership subscriptions, along with payment processing fees. Patreon also collects five percent from digital product sales.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will cut its fees from 30 percent to 15 percent after a subscription has lasted for one year, which is standard operating procedure for the in-app purchases. Apple has been cracking down on the sale of digital goods post-pandemic, and Facebook has also been required to pay Apple's in-app purchase fees <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/apple-responds-to-meta-boosted-posts-fee/">for ad purchases</a> on iOS devices.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/patreon-in-app-purchase-fees/">Apple Requiring Patreon to Use In-App Purchase and Pay 30% Fee for Memberships</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-requiring-patreon-to-use-in-app-purchase-and-pay-30-fee-for-memberships.2433463/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> is seemingly preparing for a significant expansion of its "Look Around" feature to compete more aggressively with Google's Street View.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/apple-maps-and-look-around.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-744451" /><br/>
Apple's "Look Around" feature offers high-resolution, interactive street-level imagery in the Maps app. To date, its scope has been relatively limited, mainly concentrated in major metropolitan areas and a few select regions worldwide. <br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://x.com/RhinozzCode/status/1822300959520784672">recent discovery</a> by X user Ryan Fae, shared with <em>MacRumors</em>, reveals that &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj;' vector tile format, used in the beta version of the web-based platform, leaks information about future Look Around coverage areas. This information, found within the Maps app's underlying code, outlines a more extensive network of planned coverage that's far beyond what is currently available. <br/>
<br/>
The leaked data shows that in the United States, Look Around coverage will no longer be confined to major cities. Instead, it will expand to include major highways, smaller cities, and rural areas. The findings also suggest that new countries are set to gain Look Around coverage as well, including Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, China, Belarus, Turkey, Bulgaria, Mexico, and Slovakia. The expansion into some of these places aligns with sightings of Apple mapping vehicles in 2023. For many of these regions, this would represent the first time high-quality street-level imagery has been made available, as Google's Street View either lacks coverage or is of low quality in these areas. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-planning-to-expand-look-around/">Apple Planning to Expand Maps App&#039;s &#039;Look Around&#039; Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-planning-to-expand-maps-apps-look-around-feature.2433460/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> "Slim" could be positioned as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> "Air" to boost sales, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature-Single-Camera-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-960528" /><br/>
In the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman explained how the "fourth" model in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup since 2020 (the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> mini, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Plus, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Plus) has largely been a commercial failure. In the case of the Plus model, this is likely because it is just &#36;100 less than the Pro, so most customers simply opt for the higher-end model.<br/>
<br/>
There has been uncertainty in recent months about the intention of the so-called &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Slim" and its rumored position in the lineup. Last week, YouTuber <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a> was <a href="https://youtu.be/8c7HWZRO_D8?feature=shared">first to suggest</a> that the device could be positioned as an "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air." Now, Gurman seems to have supported this idea.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Air" will represent a new approach to this fourth model in the lineup, offering a device with a substantially thinner design that sits between the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro. Gurman compared the device to the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> from 2008, which sat between the regular MacBook and MacBook Pro in the lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The sales pitch will probably go like this: If you want something snazzier than a standard iPhone — but don't really need the performance, screen size or cameras of a Pro model — you can get something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
At minimum, Gurman expects the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; "Air" to be more popular than the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; mini and Plus devices from recent years.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman added that the thinner design of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Air" will "just be a step toward something better" since Apple will eventually want to "squeeze the power of a Pro model into this smaller design." However, he does not expect this to occur before 2027 at the earliest.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/slim-iphone-17-could-be-iphone-air/">Next Year&#039;s Slim iPhone 17 Could Be an &#039;iPhone Air&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-years-slim-iphone-17-could-be-an-iphone-air.2433457/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LG is seeking compensation from Apple following the abrupt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/kuo-says-microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled/">cancelation of the microLED Apple Watch</a> due to the substantial investments it made in preparation of the project, <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=29615"><em>The Elec</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Black-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905396" /><br/>
As a result of the device's cancelation, LG Display has apparently been left with substantial sunk costs, including the expense of purchasing 14 U.S. patents related to microLED technology from Taiwan's Ultra Display. The company now faces potential claims from its equipment partners, some of whom had also invested in the project without formal contracts in place. LG also moved equipment from Gumi in Gyeongsangbuk-do to Paju in Gyeonggi-do, secured space for the microLED backplane process, and recruited specialized personnel to form a task force dedicated to the project. Overall, LG reportedly spent hundreds of billions of won to prepare for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to cancel the project was reportedly based on concerns about the economic viability of microLED technology for the Apple Watch. Despite its potential advantages—such as brighter displays, improved color accuracy, and better power efficiency compared to existing OLED technology—Apple determined that the production costs associated with microLED were too high to justify its inclusion in the Apple Watch. There were also significant challenges related to the manufacturing process, which would have made it more difficult to produce the displays in the required quantities.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg-display/">LG Display</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/">The Elec</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/lg-seeking-compensation-from-apple-over-microled/">LG Seeking Compensation From Apple Over Canceled MicroLED Apple Watch Project</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lg-seeking-compensation-from-apple-over-canceled-microled-apple-watch-project.2433448/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's M3 MacBook Pro is seeing multiple high value discounts on Best Buy and Amazon today, with up to &#36;1,000 off select models. This includes a new all-time low price on the entry-level M3 512GB 14-inch MacBook Pro at <a href="https://howl.me/cmRrRHevBas"><strong>&#36;1,299.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.00, and a <a href="https://howl.me/cmFTeyXwYzw">massive &#36;1,000 discount</a> on the high-end 16-inch model exclusively for <a href="https://howl.me/cmRsmSGd2jO">Best Buy members</a>.<br/>

<br/>
Across the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro lineup you'll find &#36;300-&#36;400 off every model on both Best Buy and Amazon. In regards to the Best Buy discounts, most these do not require a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership and are available to all customers. The only exception is the M3 Pro 512GB model, which has an extra &#36;100 discount exclusively for Best Buy members.<br/>

If you're shopping for the 16-inch M3 MacBook Pro, we're also tracking steep discounts on every model at both retailers. The biggest savings will be found on the M3 Max, 48GB RAM, 1TB SSD model at Best Buy, which is being discounted by &#36;500 for all shoppers, and an extra &#36;500 exclusively for My Best Buy members. This adds up to a massive &#36;1,000 discount on the high-end 16-inch MacBook Pro, at the new record low price of <a href="https://howl.me/cmFTeyXwYzw"><strong>&#36;2,999.00</strong></a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[This weekend we're tracking a big collection of discounts on Bluetooth trackers, including Apple's own AirTag as well as Anker's more affordable brand of Eufy SmartTrack accessories. All of these deals can be found on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/airtag-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940079" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the AirTag, you can get the 1 Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CWXNS552%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;23.99</strong></a> and the 4 Pack of trackers for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;72.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;99.00. The 4 Pack price is an all-time low while the 1 Pack price is just shy of its all-time low.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CWXNS552%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;5 OFF</div>AirTag 1 Pack for &#36;23.99</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Anyone who needs a Bluetooth tracker but wants to save a bit of money should look at Anker's Eufy brand of trackers, which are on sale on Amazon right now and compatible with Find My on Apple devices. These start at just &#36;13.99 for one tracker and raise to &#36;48.99 for a 4 Pack. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B8GDXPBL%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.F587O4DYC8XW%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.F587O4DYC8XW_1723214586794"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;6 OFF</div>SmartTrack Link 1 Pack for &#36;13.99</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
If you want a tracker that you can fit in a wallet, Eufy's SmartTrack Card is a great solution at &#36;16.95, down from &#36;29.99. Most of Eufy's trackers can be delivered between August 11 and August 15, and none of these deals require a coupon code in order to see the final sale prices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's work on iOS 18 continues, with a new Distraction Control feature and refinements for the Photos app, among other tweaks, coming in the latest beta. We're only about a month away from the official release, so Apple should be firming things up shortly.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/top-stories-10aug2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961288" /><br/>
In another news, we've known for a while that Apple is planning to update its entire Mac lineup with variants of the M4 chip, but we learned this week that the Mac mini is apparently set to get a redesign as part of its update, so read on below for details on this and all of our other top stories from this week!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Hands-On With Safari's New Distraction Control in the iOS 18 Beta</h2><br/>
Apple has released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-5-to-developers/">fifth developer beta</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-seeds-ios-18-public-beta-3/">third public beta of iOS 18</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/safari-distraction-control-hands-on/">key new feature in the latest betas is Distraction Control</a>, which gives you the option to hide distracting elements on a website, such as newsletter sign-up fields and embedded video players. Apple said the feature is not designed to be an ad blocker, and it cannot permanently hide ads.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Beta-ft.-Distraction-Control-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961284" /><br/>
We <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/safari-distraction-control-hands-on/">went hands-on with Distraction Control in a recent video</a> shared on our YouTube channel, so check that out for a closer look at the feature. Also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-safari-distraction-control/">read our initial story about the feature</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Tweaks iOS 18 Photos App in Fifth Beta</h2><br/>
iOS 18 features a completely redesigned Photos app on the iPhone, but the changes have not been well received by all users. As a result, Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-photos-app/">making some tweaks</a> to the app's user interface while the software update remains in beta testing.<br/>

<h2>M4 Mac Mini Rumored to Become Apple's Smallest Computer Ever With Complete Redesign</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/">next-generation Mac mini will feature a "far smaller" footprint</a>, with the computer set to become nearly as small as an Apple TV box, according to a report from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Silver-Perspective.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961276" /><br/>
Gurman expects the new Mac mini to be released later this year. He said there will be two models of the computer, including one with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-debuts-m4-chip/">M4 chip that debuted in the iPad Pro</a>, and one with an all-new M4 Pro chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next Apple Watch SE Could Be Made From Plastic</h2><br/>
In his latest newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-watch-se-plastic/">increasingly likely that the next Apple Watch SE will have a plastic casing</a>, whereas the current model of the device has an aluminum casing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-se-gen-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-865510" /><br/>
Gurman said a plastic casing could allow for the Apple Watch SE to have a lower price, and a more kid-friendly design with colorful options. The next Apple Watch SE is expected to be announced in September.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple typically releases its new iPhone series in the fall, and a possible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/iphone-16-september-launch-on-track/">September 10 announcement date</a> has been floated this year, which means we are just one month away from the launch of the iPhone 16. Like the iPhone 15 series, this year's lineup is expected to stick with four models – iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max – although there are plenty of design differences and new features to take into account.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
To bring you up to speed, we've summarized below the biggest iPhone 16 rumors we've covered so far here on <em>MacRumors</em>. For more details, follow the links, or dive into our dedicated roundups for both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    1. Larger Displays</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Biggest Ever iPhones</span><br><br/>
This year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to be getting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">bigger display sizes</a>, increasing to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The new display sizes would be the largest ever for the iPhone.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    2. Vertical Camera Layout</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 16 base models will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">vertical camera arrangement</a> with a pill-shaped raised surface, instead of a diagonal camera arrangement like the iPhone 15. The new camera bump features two separate camera rings for the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras. The vertical camera layout is expected to enable Spatial Video recording, which is currently limited to the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
3. Battery Changes</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 16 Models</span><br><br/>
Rumors suggest the ‌iPhone 16‌ and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">larger batteries</a> than their predecessors, although the smaller iPhone 16 Pro device could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-16-pro-battery-capacities/">see the biggest improvement</a>, while the ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus may have reduced capacity. The iPhone 16 is said to have a 6% increase over the iPhone 15, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max gaining a 5% increase, and the iPhone 16 Pro seeing a 9% increase. In contrast, the iPhone 16 Plus is rumored to have a 9% reduction in capacity. On the other hand, Apple could also potentially use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/iphone-15-hybrid-lens-rumor/">stacked battery technology</a> to increase energy density and prolong lifespan across the lineup. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
4. Capture Button</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">New Camera Capabilities</span><br><br/>
All iPhone 16 models will have a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">Capture Button</a>" dedicated to triggering image or video capture. The button will add features like the ability to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus on a subject with a light press, and activate a recording with a more forceful press. The Capture Button will be located on the bottom right side of the ‌iPhone 16, and will take the place of the mmWave antenna on U.S. ‌iPhone‌ models, with the antenna relocating to the left side of the device below the volume and Action buttons.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
5. Ultra Wide Lens Upgrade</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to feature an upgraded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera lens</a>, which should allow it to capture more light, resulting in improved photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments. This also means that iPhone 16 Pro models should be able to shoot 48-megapixel ProRAW photos in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/iphone-16-pro-dual-48mp-cameras/">rumored</a> to boast a bigger main camera thanks to an advanced custom 48-megapixel Sony IMX903 sensor.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
6. Super Telephoto Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro Max could be the first to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/iphone-16-pro-max-super-telephoto-camera/">super telephoto periscope camera</a> for dramatically increased optical zoom. "Super" or "ultra" telephoto usually describes cameras with a focal length of over 300mm. The current telephoto lens is equivalent to a 77mm lens, so if accurate, there could be a notable increase in zoom capabilities. Super telephoto cameras are often used for sports and wild animal photography, but the extremely soft backgrounds they create also make them useful for portrait photography, providing there is enough distance between the subject and the photographer.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
7. Faster Wi-Fi Support</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Wi-Fi 6E & Wi-Fi 7</span><br><br/>
Apple's 2024 iPhone Pro models are expected to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">Wi-Fi 7 in the Pro models</a>, enabling data transfer over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously. This should result in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. With technologies such as 4K QAM, Wi-Fi 7 is  also expected to offer peak data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">rumored to support Wi-Fi 6E</a>, which works with the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
8. New A18 Series Chips</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 16 Models</span><br><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">next-generation A18 Pro chip</a> is expected to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E. All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to rumors, but Apple could still differentiate between the standard models and the Pro models, even giving the chips separate A18 and A18 Pro names. It makes sense for all four ‌iPhone 16‌ models to have the same A18 chip because of the Apple Intelligence features set to debut in iOS 18. Apple Intelligence requires a high-powered chip for the AI features to run on-device. At this time, only the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and Pro Max are able to use Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
9. 5G Qualcomm Modem</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple is expected to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-5g-advanced-rumor/">Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X75 modem</a> in this year's Pro and Pro Max models. The Snapdragon X75 includes improved carrier aggregation and other technology advancements for faster 5G download and upload speeds compared to the X70, which is used in iPhone 15 models. The modem's combined mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G transceiver also takes up 25% less circuit board space, and is said to use up to 20% less power. The standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to retain the Snapdragon X70 modem.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
10. Tetraprism Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro</span><br><br/>
Both iPhone 16 Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">expected to feature 5x optical zoom</a>, which is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple's tetraprism lens system has a "folded" design that allows it to fit inside the smartphone, enabling up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom. In contrast, the current smaller iPhone 15 Pro is limited to up to 3x optical zoom, which is in line with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
11. Micro-Lens Technology</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">More Efficient OLED</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be weighing up the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/iphone-16-oled-displays-micro-lens-efficiency/">use of micro-lens technology</a> to maintain or increase the brightness of OLED displays on next year's iPhone 16 models while potentially reducing their power consumption. MLA works by using a uniform pattern of billions of lenses inside the panel that reduces internal reflections. These lenses turn the path of light reflected backwards from the inside of the panel towards the screen, which can serve either to increase perceived brightness while maintaining the same level of power consumption, or maintain brightness levels while consuming less power compared to conventional OLED panels at the same luminance.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
12. Action Button</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro models include an Action Button, and in 2024, the Action Button is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">expanded to the standard iPhone 16 models</a>. The Action Button used across the iPhone 16 lineup will be identical to the iPhone 15 Pro Action Button. The Action button, which replaces the traditional mute switch, can perform multiple functions such as activating the Flashlight, turning on the Camera, launching a Shortcut, enabling or disabling a Focus mode, using Translate, turning on/off Silent Mode, and more.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
13. 40W Fast Charging and 20W MagSafe</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will support 40W wired fast charging and 20W MagSafe charging, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/iphone-16-pro-40w-fast-charging-20w-magsafe/">recurring rumor</a>. Right now, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models are capable of up to 27W peak charging speeds with an appropriate USB-C power adapter, while official MagSafe chargers from Apple and authorized third parties can wirelessly charge the iPhone 15 models at up to 15W. The charging boost is expected to balance and improve the problem of increasing charging time caused by the increase in battery capacity. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
14. Upgraded Microphone</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Enhanced Siri</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">significant upgrade</a> to the iPhone 16 microphone to improve the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/">Apple Intelligence-enhanced Siri experience</a>, which will include contextual awareness, semantic indexing, app control, and on-screen awareness. Apple's Siri AI ambitions will heavily rely on improved voice input processing, and the new mic is expected to offer significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
15. New Thermal Design</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Reduced Heat</span><br><br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">graphene thermal system</a> for the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup, while the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models could add metal battery casings to reduce overheating. Graphene has high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper, which is currently used in iPhone heat-sinks. Another source has claimed that iPhone 16 models will be equipped with a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/internal-change-to-iphone-16-models-expected-to-reduce-overheating/">larger graphite sheet</a>" inside the chassis of the devices, to address potential overheating. The move could be in response to widely encountered overheating issues experienced with the iPhone 15 Pro, which Apple addressed through a software update.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
16. Expanded Storage</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available with double the maximum storage capacity as the iPhone 15 Pro models, increasing from 1TB to 2TB, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">according to one rumor</a>. The move is said to be a result of Apple's switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash for higher storage models. Apple's use of QLC NAND could allow Apple to fit more storage into a smaller space and it is less expensive than Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND, which current iPhones use. On the downside, QLC has comparatively slower read and write speeds.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
17. Increased Memory</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models have been rumored to both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">feature 8GB of RAM</a>, an increase over the 6GB of RAM in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. More working memory should equate to improved performance for multitasking on the iPhone. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/apple-iphone-15-pro-requirement-apple-intelligence/">hinted</a> that plenty of RAM is required for Apple Intelligence features, so it is perhaps no coincidence that all devices in the iPhone 16 lineup will have at least 8GB of RAM.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>

Apple's next-generation A18 chips will feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">upgraded Neural Engine</a> with "significantly" more cores, according to one Taiwanese report. An upgraded Neural Engine should improve the performance of Apple Intelligence features and machine learning tasks. Apple's iPhone 12 through iPhone 15 models all include a 16-core Neural Engine. Despite no difference in core counts across generations, Apple has still managed to improve their performance in successive models.<br/>

19. Ultra-Thin Bezel Technology</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Maximized Display Size</span><br><br/>
Apple plans to maximize the display size on the iPhone 16 series by using a new ultra-thin bezel technology, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/">according to one rumor</a>. Apple will use Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology to minimize the bezel at the bottom of the display. BRS achieves this by rolling up the internal copper wiring into a more compact package. Apple reportedly plans to apply the borderless display technology to all four iPhone 16 models, but the Pro models will have the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/iphone-16-pro-thinnest-bezels-smartphone/">thinnest bezels of any smartphone</a>, beating the screen border thinness of even its latest iPhone 15 Pro devices.<br/>

20. New Polished Titanium Finish</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple will use an improved finishing process for the titanium chassis on the iPhone 16 Pro models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/">according to one rumor</a>. The new process will allegedly make the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max look more polished than the iPhone 15 Pro models, which have a brushed finish. The improved manufacturing process will result in a glossy appearance that is more akin to the heavily polished stainless steel material used in previous Pro iPhones. However, the new titanium finish will be less prone to scratches compared to stainless steel.<br/>

21. Reduced Lens Flare</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Less Photo Artifacts</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/iphone-16-pro-camera-reduced-lens-flare/">testing</a> a new anti-reflective optical coating technology for its iPhone cameras that could improve the quality of photos by reducing artifacts like lens flare and ghosting. Apple plans to bring new atomic layer deposition (ALD) equipment into the iPhone camera lens manufacturing process to apply the coating. ALD-applied materials can also protect against environmental damage to the camera lens system without affecting the sensor's ability to capture light effectively.<br/>

22. New Colors</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 16 Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/iphone-16-lineup-to-come-in-these-two-new-colors/">expected</a> to be available in black, white or silver, gray or "Natural Titanium," and rose. This suggests that the iPhone 15 Pro's Blue Titanium option will be discontinued and replaced with a new rose color, which could even have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/new-iphone-16-pro-color-bronze-appearance/">bronze appearance</a> under certain lighting conditions. Meanwhile, the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus is said to be coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/revealed-iphone-16-colors-redesigned-camera/">black, green, pink, blue, and white</a>. Compared to the iPhone 15, this means that white will replace yellow, with the other colors remaining the same.<br/>
