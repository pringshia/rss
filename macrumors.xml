		<title>Apple Vision Pro Weighs Almost as Much as a 12.9-Inch iPad Pro</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Vision Pro headset can weigh almost 23 ounces (650 grams), depending on configuration, the company today confirmed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898552" /><br/>
Apple says that the Vision Pro specifically weighs between 21.2 and 22.9 ounces (600 and 650 grams) depending on which Light Seal and head band is used on the device. The separate battery weighs 12.5 ounces (353 grams). For reference, this means that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, excluding the battery, weighs almost as much as a 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, which comes in at 24 ounces (682 grams).<br/>
<br/>
The weight of Apple's headset was unknown until today, but it was widely rumored to be heavy compared to competing devices. This is not necessarily the case, since while the Meta Quest 3 weighs 18.2 ounces (516 grams), the higher-end Meta Quest Pro weighs 25.5 ounces (722 grams) – substantially more than the Vision Pro. However, the Meta Quest Pro has a weighted battery pack at the back of the headset's headband to make it much less front-heavy and ostensibly improve comfort.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders of the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-now-available-for-pre-order/">opened earlier today</a> and the device launches in the United States on Friday, February 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-weighs-almost-as-much-as-ipad-pro/">Apple Vision Pro Weighs Almost as Much as a 12.9-Inch iPad Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-weighs-almost-as-much-as-a-12-9-inch-ipad-pro.2416790/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/vision-pro-lens-inserts-to-start-at-99/">optional ZEISS lens inserts</a> designed for Apple's Vision Pro headset can be engraved at no additional cost. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-lens-inserts.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931717" /><br/>
Custom wording of the customer's choice can be engraved into the black plastic sides of the optional ZEISS lens inserts designed for those who normally wear glasses or contact lenses. The option is probably intended to help multiple users identify which lens inserts belong to them, rather than be a novel way to personalize the device, since they are very small and there is no other engraving option for the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Apple offers two versions of the ZEISS Optical Inserts at different price points. "ZEISS Optical Inserts — Readers" are available for &#36;99, while "ZEISS Optical Inserts — Prescription" are available for &#36;149. The inserts attach to the Vision Pro lenses magnetically, allowing for precise viewing and eye tracking. Purchase requires a valid prescription from an optician.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders of the Vision Pro started earlier today and the device goes on sale in the United States on Friday, February 2.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For international customers who are thinking of purchasing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> in the United States and using it in their own country, Apple has cautioned that they will be faced with several limitations when attempting to use the device.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929682" /><br/>
According to a FAQ on Apple's Vision Pro <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-vision/apple-vision-pro">pre-order page</a> on its online store, the experience will differ from a U.S.-based customer in the following ways:<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>&zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; only supports English (U.S.) for language and typing and English for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Dictation.</li><br/>
    <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> requires an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> with region set to the U.S.</li><br/>
    <li>Purchases on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and TV app require an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; with region set to the U.S.</li><br/>
    <li>For customers with vision correction needs, ZEISS will only accept vision prescriptions written by U.S. eye care professionals, and will only ship to U.S. locations.</li><br/>
    <li>Customers may not be able to access certain apps, features, or content due to licensing or other restrictions in those countries or regions.</li><br/>
    <li>Apple Support is only available in the U.S.</li><br/>
</ul>Apple says that the spatial computing headset is designed for customers in the U.S. to use at home, at work, and while traveling. "We look forward to bringing &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; to more countries later this year," notes the company. <br/>
<br/>
While orders are limited to the United States for the time being, Apple is likely to launch the Vision Pro headset <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">outside the U.S. before WWDC 2024 in June</a>, with Canada and the United Kingdom tipped as the first two other countries in which the headset will be available.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro will launch on Friday, February 2, which is when pre-orders will be delivered to U.S. customers.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-apple-id-set-to-us/">Apple Vision Pro App Store, Apple Music, and TV App Require US Apple ID</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-app-store-apple-music-and-tv-app-require-us-apple-id.2416783/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The video, <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/guided-tour/">available on the Vision Pro page of Apple's website</a> and on YouTube, provides a basic overview of how to use the headset and its key features. It highlights aspects like viewing photos and panoramas, Spatial Video playback, placing windows in 3D space, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls, immersive environments, bringing a Mac display into the space, and experiences like Mindfulness and "Encounter Dinosaurs."

		<description><![CDATA[Delivery dates for orders of Apple's Vision Pro headset have already slipped to mid-March after pre-orders opened earlier today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Vision-Pro-Pre-Orders-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931603" /><br/>
The Vision Pro launches in the United States on Friday, February 2, but those now placing an online pre-order will not receive the headset until around the middle of March for all three storage capacities. This delivery time frame is likely to get pushed back even further as more people place orders.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could have some in-store stock available for in-person purchase on Friday, February 2, as well as in subsequent days and weeks as stores receive new deliveries for walk-in buyers, but supply is still highly likely to be limited. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> recently reported that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/kuo-vision-pro-sellout-likely/">only 80,000 headsets</a> would be available for the device's launch and warned that the device could quickly sell out.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-delivery-dates-slip/">Apple Vision Pro Delivery Dates Slip to Mid-March</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-delivery-dates-slip-to-mid-march.2416780/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> should not be used while wearing hard contact lenses, Apple says in its pre-order process for its new spatial computing headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-vision-pro-eye.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922615" /><br/>
According to a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213965?cid=mc-ols-visionpro-article_ht213965-buy_flow-11182023">new linked support document</a>, wearing hard contacts "might impact your experience with &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;." Apple goes on to suggest that those who use such contacts when not wearing glasses may be able to use ZEISS Optical Inserts instead. <br/>
<blockquote>If you experience difficulty with eye tracking, and your eye care provider has indicated that eye glasses with a comprehensive prescription are an option for you, then you may consider ordering ZEISS Optical Inserts. Otherwise, you may use an alternate form of input such as Pointer Control. </blockquote>For users who have had monovision corrective surgery, Apple recommends that they consult with an eye care provider for a comprehensive prescription that works within the supported prescription range for &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. Apple also says that &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; works well with most soft contact lenses, but cosmetic contact lenses are not compatible with the headset and should be removed before using the device. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also offers the following advice for people with a diagnosed vision condition:<br/>
<blockquote>Some medical conditions, such as those involving eyelid drooping, changes in eye alignment (including strabismus or lazy eye), or uncontrolled eye movements (including nystagmus) might make it difficult for Apple Vision Pro to properly detect your eyes. This might impact the visual experience.</blockquote>Apple says that to compensate for any of the above, users can adapt &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; to suit their needs for navigation using the headset's accessibility features. Instead of using their eyes, users can use their wrist, head, index finger, or voice to navigate. <br/>
<br/>
Starting at &#36;3,499, &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; pre-orders are now open, with the devices scheduled to ship to customers on February 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-says-vision-pro-no-hard-contact-lenses/">Apple Says Vision Pro Does Not Support Hard Contact Lenses</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-vision-pro-does-not-support-hard-contact-lenses.2416779/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

At &#36;499, the Vision Pro's optional support and service plan is one of the costliest available on any Apple device. This is in line with high-end Mac models at a similar price point to the Vision Pro, which costs &#36;3,499.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ for the Vision Pro includes unlimited repairs for accidental damage protection, Apple-certified service and support, Express Replacement Service (the company will ship you a replacement so you don't have to wait for a repair), and 24/7 priority access to "Apple experts."<br/>
<br/>
The pricing of &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ for the Vision Pro was not clear until pre-orders opened earlier today.

The Vision Pro headset is available with 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage. While the existence of a 256GB model was confirmed upon Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">announcement</a> of the headset's release date earlier this month, the other specific storage options and their price points were unknown until pre-orders opened earlier today.

<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li><strong>256GB</strong>: &#36;3,499</li><br/>
	<li><strong>512GB</strong>: &#36;3,699</li><br/>
	<li><strong>1TB</strong>: &#36;3,899</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today finally shared additional <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/specs/">tech specs</a> for its Vision Pro headset following the start of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-now-available-for-pre-order/">pre-orders in the United States</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-chips.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898904" /><br/>
Apple confirmed that the M2 chip in the Vision Pro is available with an 8-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, along with 16GB of unified memory.<br/>
<br/>
As previously announced, the Vision Pro is also equipped with an all-new R1 chip that "processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user's eyes." Apple's tech specs reveal that the R1 chip has 256GB/s memory bandwidth.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro is available with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-available-with-these-storage-options/">256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro's dual micro-OLED displays deliver more than 23 million pixels, with 92% coverage of the DCI-P3 color space. Supported refresh rates include 90Hz, 96Hz, and 100Hz, with 24 fps and 30 fps video playback options.<br/>
<br/>
The headset is equipped with two main cameras, six world‑facing tracking cameras, four eye‑tracking cameras, a TrueDepth camera, a LiDAR Scanner, four inertial measurement units, a flicker sensor, and an ambient light sensor. There is also a six‑microphone array with directional beamforming.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro weighs 600 to 650 grams, depending on the Light Seal and head band configuration. The external battery packs weighs 353 grams.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro is controlled with your hands, eyes, and/or voice, and it offers a variety of accessibility options. Optic ID provides iris-based biometric authentication. <br/>
<br/>
The headset includes AirPlay support at up to 1080p, allowing you to mirror your Vision Pro view to any AirPlay‑enabled device, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, most Apple TV models, and AirPlay‑enabled smart TVs.<br/>
<br/>
As previously known, the Vision Pro offers up to two hours of battery life overall, and up to 2.5 hours for video playback.<br/>
<br/>
Other specs and features include Wi‑Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, HDR10 support, Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro launches in the U.S. on Friday, February 2, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-now-available-for-pre-order/">pre-orders starting today</a>. Apple previously announced that it would release the headset in additional countries later this year, but it's unclear exactly when or where.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is now accepting pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, the company's first spatial computing device. Orders are live in the U.S. online store, with the Vision Pro limited to the United States for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Vision-Pro-Pre-Orders-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931602" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> app on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> is the best way to order the Vision Pro, because the ordering process requires a face scan to determine the correctly sized Light Seal and head band for each user. Accessories need to be in the right size for the Vision Pro to work as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who wear eyeglasses will need to submit a valid, unexpired prescription from a U.S. eye-care professional to order ZEISS lenses that can be inserted into the headset, but this can be done after the ordering process.<br/>
<br/>
Priced at &#36;3,500, the Vision Pro features an aluminum alloy frame with a laminated glass front, and it is equipped with two 4K micro OLED displays with 23 million pixels combined. More than a dozen cameras do everything from tracking eye movements to registering hand gestures as a method of control to mapping the area around the wearer.<br/>
<br/>
A soft, fitted Light Seal attaches magnetically to the frame and conforms to the wearer's face to block out ambient light, and there are two bands that come with it, including the Solo Knit Band and the Dual Loop Band. The Solo Knit Band is made of a stretchy, braided material, while the Dual Loop Band has an extra strap that goes over the head for better weight distribution.<br/>
<br/>
As a mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro is able to display augmented reality content overlaid on the real world, or immersive content that is entirely virtual. A Digital Crown on the side of the device controls the level of immersiveness. The Vision Pro runs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, and it has a dedicated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. It is also able to connect to a Mac to serve as a display, and it can be used with a keyboard and mouse. Apple is using an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip in the Vision Pro with an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU, plus it has a second R1 chip that is responsible for interpreting the information coming from the cameras, sensors, and microphones.<br/>
<br/>
With an included external battery pack, the Vision Pro lasts for up to 2.5 hours, but it can also be plugged in for all-day use.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/kuo-vision-pro-sellout-likely/">made a limited number</a> of Vision Pro headsets for the initial launch of the device, and units are expected to sell out. Those who want to get their hands on a Vision Pro should plan to pre-order immediately.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro will launch on Friday, February 2, which is when pre-orders will be delivered. There may also be units available for in-store purchases at that time, but how many headsets each store will get is unknown.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-now-available-for-pre-order/">Apple Vision Pro Now Available for Pre-Order</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-now-available-for-pre-order.2416770/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This year's forthcoming iPhone 16 Pro models will be available with a new 2TB maximum storage option, claims a new rumor coming out of Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Right-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928697" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223327662832&navType=by">news aggregator account "yeux1122"</a> on the Naver blog, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available with double the maximum storage capacity as the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
The move is said to be a result of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/1tb-iphone-16-pro-could-face-performance-setback/">recently rumored</a> switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash for higher storage models. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's use of QLC NAND could allow Apple to fit more storage into a smaller space and it is less expensive than Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND, which current iPhones use. On the downside, QLC has comparatively slower read and write speeds.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that in the last couple of years we have seen rumors that both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/01/iphone-14-to-feature-2tb-storage/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/iphone-15-pro-2tb-storage-option/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> would feature 2TB options for the same reason, but they turned out to be false. <br/>
<br/>
That said, this year Apple is expected to add a new "Capture Button" to the iPhone 16 models for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">taking video</a>. According to <em>The Information</em>, the button is being introduced to further push the iPhone as a camera alternative for shooting horizontal video, so offering higher storage options could be part of that plan.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">iPhone 16 Pro Models to Come With 2TB Storage Option, Claims Rumor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-models-to-come-with-2tb-storage-option-claims-rumor.2416765/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's online store is down in the U.S. ahead of Vision Pro pre-orders, which are scheduled to open at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time, ahead of the device's official launch on Friday, February 2. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-store-down-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931625" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> is the company's first foray into the world of mixed reality, or "spatial computing" as Apple likes to call it. The device has been in development for more than a decade and features an array of sophisticated technologies that allow it to display augmented reality content superimposed on the world around you, and entirely virtual content for immersive entertainment and gaming experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Starting at &#36;3,499, the wearable headset device features two micro-OLED displays that deliver over 4K resolution to each eye, and an external display called EyeSight that projects an image of your eyes so people can tell whether you're using the headset in an immersive mode or if you can see what's going on around you. For glasses wearers, there are custom prescription Zeiss Optical Inserts (&#36;149) that can be attached magnetically to the headset's lenses, and optional readers (&#36;99) will be available.<br/>
<br/>
The device includes an array of sensors and cameras for monitoring hand gestures and mapping the external environment, and there are speakers on either side of the headset. Vision Pro is powered by an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> processor and a separate R1 processor dedicated to processing information coming from these sensors. It also comes with 16GB of RAM and at least 256GB of onboard storage, with the potential for Apple to offer models with up to 1TB of storage, although this hasn't been officially confirmed. An external battery pack is included in the box.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-vision-pro-pre-order-need-to-know/">Pre-Ordering Apple Vision Pro: What You Need to Know</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple is planning to produce between 60,000 and 80,000 Vision Pro units for the February 2 launch of the device, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/kuo-vision-pro-sellout-likely/">according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. With the small size of the shipment, Kuo believes that the Vision Pro will "sell out soon after the release."<br/>
<br/>
Orders are limited to the United States for the time being, but Apple is likely to launch the Vision Pro headset <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">outside the U.S. before WWDC 2024 in June</a>, with Canada and the United Kingdom tipped as the first two other countries in which the headset will be available. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-store-down-vision-pro-pre-orders/">Apple Store Down Ahead of Vision Pro Headset Pre-Orders</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-down-ahead-of-vision-pro-headset-pre-orders.2416760/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2024/01/celebrity-trainer-joe-wicks-makes-guest-appearance-in-apple-fitness-plus/">announced</a> that British fitness coach Joe Wicks MBE, also known as "The Body Coach," is set to make a guest appearance in Apple Fitness+ to "help users kick-start their fitness routine" this new year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Fitness-Plus-UK-Joe-Wicks.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931617" /><br/>
Starting January 22, the service will host Wicks in exclusive 10-minute Strength and HIIT workouts alongside Fitness+ trainers Kim Ngo and Jamie-Ray Hartshorne. Apple says the workouts are designed to be "easy for anyone to join in, no matter where they are at on their health and wellbeing journey." The workouts are inspired by Wicks’s favorite HIIT and strength moves, and will feature songs from his new playlist on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Readers in the United Kingdom will recognize Wicks from his inclusive online home workout series that went viral during the 2020 lockdown, earning him the moniker "PE teacher to the nation." Wicks also received a high honor from the late Queen for his extensive fitness and charity work.<br/>
<blockquote>"I'm a huge fan of Apple Fitness+ and its welcoming and inclusive approach to fitness and wellbeing," said Wicks. "We had a lot fun developing these workouts together, and I'm looking forward to helping as many people as possible start, continue, or reach their fitness goals this year."</blockquote>Apple Fitness+ is available as a subscription service for £9.99 per month or £79.99 per year, and can be shared with up to five other family members. Fitness+ is also included in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> Premier plan, which, where available, also gives customers access to &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a>+, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>+ with 2TB of storage, and can be shared with up to five other family members.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fitness-plus/">Apple Fitness Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/joe-wicks-guest-appearance-apple-fitness/">UK &#039;Body Coach&#039; Joe Wicks to Make Guest Appearance on Apple Fitness+</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-body-coach-joe-wicks-to-make-guest-appearance-on-apple-fitness.2416757/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

When the news broke about the extra button, we didn't initially know what it was for, but the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">name gave us some hints</a> and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> confirmed in December that it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/">used for taking video</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Pro-Mock-Header-Updated.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924442" /><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-camera-button-as-creators-shift-to-horizontal-videos">The Information</a></em> has now shared a few new details on the function of the Capture Button, including some of the gestures that it will support. The site says that the button is mechanical rather than capacitive, but it will respond to pressure and touch.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users will be able to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus with a light press, and activate a recording with a more forceful press.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to put the Capture Button on the right side of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, located below the Power button and in an ideal spot for finger access when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is held in a horizontal orientation. At the current time, this is the location of the mmWave antenna in the United States, but the antenna will move to the left side of the device with the addition of the extra button.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>The Information</em>, Apple believes the new button will be a major selling point for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup, and it is being introduced to further push the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as a camera alternative for shooting horizontal video.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet finalized the design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, so the function and design of the button could change in the future.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">iPhone 16 Capture Button Will Respond to Touch and Pressure for Zooming and Focusing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-capture-button-will-respond-to-touch-and-pressure-for-zooming-and-focusing.2416735/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple employees will be able to purchase the Vision Pro at a 25 percent discount, which drops the price of the device &#36;3,500 to approximately &#36;2624, not including tax.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Purple-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929681" /><br/>
Employees were told about the discount in a memo that was sent out today, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/apple-vision-pro-chief-sees-surgery-training-as-future-vision-pro-growth-areas">Bloomberg</a></em>. In the past, Apple has offered 50 percent discounts on new products like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and the Apple Watch, but the Vision Pro is more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Every three years, employees are provided with a &#36;500 credit toward a Mac, and that credit will also be able to be used for the Vision Pro, plus Apple is planning to reimburse employees that purchase the headset for the cost of any prescription lenses that are required.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders for the Vision Pro begin tomorrow at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time, with a launch to follow on Friday, February 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/apple-vision-pro-employee-discount/">Apple Giving Employees 25% Discount on Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-giving-employees-25-discount-on-vision-pro.2416733/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
