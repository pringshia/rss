		<description><![CDATA[In 2025, Apple is planning to debut a thinner version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that will be sold alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro, and &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro Max. This &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Air" will be about two millimeters thinner than the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-modem-chips-pave-way-for-slimmer-iphone-cellular-macs-and-headsets"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2100" height="1181" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974632" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is 8.25mm thick, so an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; that is 2mm thinner would come in at around 6.25mm. At 6.25mm, the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Air would be Apple's thinnest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date. The thinnest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; we've seen so far was the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6, which measured in at 6.9mm. iPhones got thicker with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X and beyond, as Apple increased thickness to provide more space for the battery, camera lenses, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> hardware, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will equip the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Air with its own custom-designed 5G modem chip, and that chip is smaller than 5G modem chips from Qualcomm. Gurman says that Apple focused on making the chip more integrated with other Apple-designed components to save space within the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and that space savings is what allowed it to create the slimmed down &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Air without sacrificing battery life, the camera, or the display quality.<br/>
<br/>
Prior rumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">have also suggested</a> that the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Air will be somewhere between 5mm and 6mm thick, and the ~6mm thickness has now been proposed by multiple reliable sources. The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Air is expected to have a display that's around 6.6 inches in size, and it will also feature a single-lens rear camera.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Air will be one of three devices that are set to get a custom Apple modem chip in 2025, with Apple also bringing the chip to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> early in the year and a low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As Apple improves its modem chip design, the saved space could allow for "new designs" such as a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. According to Gurman, Apple is continuing to explore foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; technology. Apple is aiming to phase out Qualcomm modems across a three-year period as Apple introduces increasingly more powerful modem chips.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, Apple could debut a system-on-a-chip that includes a processor, modem, Wi-Fi chip, and other parts, which would save additional space and allow for tighter integration between hardware components.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/iphone-17-air-2mm-thinner/">iPhone 17 &#039;Air&#039; Expected to Be ~2mm Thinner Than iPhone 16 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-expected-to-be-2mm-thinner-than-iphone-16-pro.2444810/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/anker-speaker-recall.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981133" /><br/>
Anker sold approximately 69,000 units in the United States, and 9,764 in Canada. All of the affected speakers were sold through Amazon between March 2023 and October 2023 and have model numbers of A3102016, A3302011, or A3302031.<br/>
<br/>
Amazon users who purchased an Anker speaker can check to see if they have an affected model by looking for the SN code on the underside of the device and <a href="https://us.soundcore.com/pages/a3102-recall">entering it on the Anker website</a>. Anker and Amazon have contacted known purchasers.<br/>
<br/>
There have been 33 reports of incidents where the lithium-ion batteries in the speakers overheated, resulting in smoking and small fires. There has been one minor burn injury associated with one of the malfunctioning speakers.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who have a faulty speaker should stop using it, turn it off, <a href="https://support.anker.com/s/emailcontactus">and contact Anker</a> for a replacement speaker.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/anker-speaker-recall/">Anker Recalling Over 70,000 Speakers Due to Fire Hazard</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anker-recalling-over-70-000-speakers-due-to-fire-hazard.2444807/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An upcoming version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset could be equipped with a custom-designed Apple modem chip, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-modem-chips-pave-way-for-slimmer-iphone-cellular-macs-and-headsets">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. In a report on Apple's plans for its in-house modem, Gurman said that Apple is "discussing" bringing cellular support to future Vision Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Orange-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929937" /><br/>
An Apple-designed modem chip is set to debut in 2025 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> "Air" models, and from there, Apple will iterate on the design and expand the technology to other devices.<br/>
<br/>
The first version of the modem chip will only have slower sub-6GHz 5G connectivity, but a second-generation model will support the faster mmWave 5G speeds, and a third-generation version in 2027 could match or exceed Qualcomm technology. The first 5G chip from Apple isn't likely to be used in a Vision Pro headset, but the second-generation or third-generation versions could be integrated into the Vision Pro, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-cellular-mac-custom-modem/">also future Macs</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Further in the future, Apple could also add its custom modem chip to augmented reality glasses, but that product is still several years away.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's ultimate goal is to phase out Qualcomm 5G modem chips, replacing them with its own modem chips. Because cellular connectivity is integral to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple plans to test its modem technology in lower volume, lower cost products to start with.<br/>
<br/>
The first version of the modem chip is smaller and more integrated with other components that are designed by Apple, but it is not as advanced as Qualcomm's 5G modem chips. Apple modem chips coming in 2026 and 2027 will be more advanced, and eventually, Apple could merge its A-series and M-series with its custom modem chips, developing a single component that would be integrated into its products.<br/>
<br/>
A second-generation Vision Pro headset could launch as early as 2025, with Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/">adding an M5 chip</a> but few design changes, but rumors on the future of the Vision Pro have been unclear with some sources pointing toward a Vision Pro 2, and others suggesting Apple wants to focus on a lower-cost model.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be developing a lower-cost version of the Vision Pro that uses more affordable components, and Gurman has said it could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/14/cheaper-apple-vision-headset-2026/">come as soon as 2025</a>. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> does not believe that a cheaper Vision Pro will come out until after 2027, however. It is not clear when the Vision Pro could get 5G technology.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/future-apple-vision-pro-could-have-5g-modem/">Future Apple Vision Pro Could Have 5G Modem</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/future-apple-vision-pro-could-have-5g-modem.2444801/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular social network TikTok did not receive a reprieve from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and it is still facing a ban that is set to be enacted in January, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/tik-tok-congress-ban-court-ruling-1f0d6837">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" /><br/>
TikTok and several of the social network's users <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/tiktok-sues-us-government/">challenged an April bill</a> that is forcing Chinese company ByteDance <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/tiktok-facing-us-ban-congress-passes-bill/">to sell TikTok</a>. The bill provided ByteDance with a nine-month period to sell TikTok to a company outside of China, and if the sale doesn't happen, TikTok won't be able to be distributed in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
TikTok claimed that the bill was unconstitutional because it infringes on free speech, but the court rejected that claim.<br/>
<br/>
While the ban is set to go into effect in January, TikTok is likely to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking an emergency stay. From there, the Supreme Court will decide whether to hear the case.<br/>
<br/>
If TikTok is banned, Google, Apple, and other app distributors will not be able to provide the app for download, nor offer updates to the app. Internet hosting services will also be blocked from supporting the app, giving U.S. users no way to download it. TikTok users will, however, be able to keep using the app so long as it functions.<br/>
<br/>
ByteDance does not plan to sell TikTok, and even if the company complied and did so, China would need to approve the sale. The Chinese government has made it clear that it will firmly oppose any sale of the TikTok app. ByteDance says that it would be impossible to give the TikTok source code to a new owner because it would take years for new engineers to become familiar enough with it to perform routine maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. lawmakers want TikTok sold to a non-China company over concerns that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data from users in the United States, and there have also been suggestions that China could use TikTok to spread political propaganda.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/tiktok-appeal-rejected-january-ban-on-track/">TikTok Still On Track for January Ban as Appeals Court Upholds Ruling</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-still-on-track-for-january-ban-as-appeals-court-upholds-ruling.2444797/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is considering bringing cellular connectivity to the Mac lineup for the first time, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-modem-chips-pave-way-for-slimmer-iphone-cellular-macs-and-headsets">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. The Cupertino company is said to be "investigating" the possibility of adding a modem chip to a future Mac, but a cellular Mac isn't likely to launch until 2026 or later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/macbook-pro-purple-february.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936771" /><br/>
Early in 2025, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-5g-modem-plans-report/">plans to introduce</a> the custom-built 5G chip that it's had in the works for years now. The modem chip will be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> "Air," giving Apple an opportunity to test the technology before rolling it out to flagship devices.<br/>
<br/>
From there, Apple's custom 5G modem chip will expand to other iPhones and iPads over a three-year period, and it may also come to the Mac. A Mac with a 5G chip would be able to connect to a cellular network just like a 5G-enabled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and Wi-Fi or a cellular hotspot would not be required.<br/>
<br/>
The first Apple modem chip will be limited to sub-6GHz 5G speeds, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/">the second-generation version</a> will support faster mmWave technology. Apple is aiming to outcompete Qualcomm with a third-generation model, offering better performance and AI features. Apple ultimately wants to phase out Qualcomm modem chips, replacing them with the modem chips that Apple has designed.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/macbook-integrated-cellular-modem-2028/">Gurman said</a> that Macs with Apple-designed modem chips would be introduced in 2028 at the earliest, with Apple planning to integrate 5G connectivity into its Apple silicon chips.<br/>
<br/>
Macs with 5G connectivity have been rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/02/apple-to-launch-macbooks-with-5g-2h-2020/">for several years</a>, and <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/edwardbaig/2008-01-23-macbook-air-review_N.htm">way back in 2008</a>, Apple considered adding a modem chip to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. Then-CEO Steve Jobs said that Apple decided not to because the modem chip would take up too much room in the case and would lock customers to a specific carrier, but chip technology has come a long way since then. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-cellular-mac-custom-modem/">Apple &#039;Investigating&#039; Macs With Cellular Connectivity</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-investigating-macs-with-cellular-connectivity.2444794/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As we wrote about earlier today, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-three-year-modem-road-map-company-plans-to-beat-qualcomm-by-2027"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> expects Apple's first 5G modem to debut <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-5g-modem-plans-report/">in a new iPhone SE, an ultra-thin iPhone 17, and low-end iPads in 2025</a>. Towards the end of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-three-year-modem-road-map-company-plans-to-beat-qualcomm-by-2027">the report</a>, he also outlined Apple's modem plans for devices launching in 2026 and 2027, and we have summarized that information below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/5G-Modem-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886940" /><br/>
According to Gurman, Apple's second-generation 5G modem will debut in the iPhone 18 lineup in 2026 and in iPad Pro models by 2027. He said this modem will better compete with Qualcomm's modems in current iPhones by adding support for the ultra-fast 5G standard known as mmWave. Overall, he said the second modem will achieve theoretical download speeds of up to 6 Gbps, compared to up to 4 Gbps for Apple's first modem.<br/>
<br/>
In 2027, he expects Apple to release its third-generation modem. The company is apparently aiming for this modem to top Qualcomm's modems in terms of performance and AI features, although it remains to be seen if it achieves this feat.<br/>
<br/>
Further out, Apple is said to be discussing merging the modem into the iPhone's A-series chip.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, this sounds like a natural progression for Apple following its decision to transition away from Qualcomm modems in iPhones. Apple and Qualcomm have had a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/">rocky relationship over the years</a>, but the two companies <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/">extended their modem supply agreement for iPhones</a> through March 2027, so Apple still has plenty of time on its side.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been rumored to be working on its own 5G modem since 2018, and it acquired Intel's smartphone modem patents in 2019 to bolster this initiative. Starting with the iPhone SE 4 in March, we should finally see the modem in action.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/">Apple&#039;s Second 5G Modem for iPhone 18 Pro and iPad Pro Expected to Support mmWave</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-second-5g-modem-for-iphone-18-pro-and-ipad-pro-expected-to-support-mmwave.2444787/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/apples-big-foldable-and-smart-home-plans/id1602394741?i=1000679482786">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss the rumored launch of Apple's first foldable in 2026 and the company's plans to move aggressively into the smart home market. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFROpARWyKU?si=_RnnD8P5AyDC9oZj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Earlier this week, display analyst Ross Young <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/02/apple-2026-foldable-iphone/">reported</a> that Apple is expected to "enter the foldable market" in the second half of 2026. Apple's "dominant position in flagship smartphones" could potentially lead to significant growth for the foldable market in 2026, ultimately leading to a record year for foldables. There have long been rumors suggesting that Apple is developing a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and several analysts believe that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">will finally debut a foldable iPhone</a> around September of 2026.<br/>
<br/>
The first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; could be between 7.9 and 8.3 inches in size, and it may have a "clamshell" design like Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip. A clamshell &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; would fold in half vertically rather than horizontally, allowing for a full-size &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when unfolded, and a smaller, pocketable device when folded.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/kuo-homepod-display-coming-late-2025/">reported</a> that Apple's long-rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> with a display has been delayed again and is now expected to launch after WWDC 2025, likely in the third quarter of the year. The new smart speaker is expected to feature Apple's A18 processor and a 6-7 inch display, with support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, says the analyst. According to Kuo, the delay is primarily attributed to software development challenges, rather than hardware issues.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a multitude of rumors about a ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a display since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/">2021</a>, and Apple actually seems to have several products in the works. Kuo's latest report harks back to previous predictions from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, who suggested Apple was developing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/">several HomePod variants with screens</a>, including one with an iPad-like display and another featuring a screen mounted on a robotic arm. Gurman had indicated these devices were unlikely to launch before 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; will reportedly emphasize smart home functionality more than current models, suggesting a strategic repositioning of the product line. The idea that Apple is targeting the smart home market follows a recent report by Gurman about Apple developing an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">all-in-one home management hub</a> with a square-shaped display, thick bezels, and a hemispherical base similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> G4.<br/>
<br/>
We also discuss smart home ecosystems more broadly and the Sonos Ace over-ear headphones as rivals to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> also has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following more than five years of development, Apple's long-rumored 5G modem will debut in the fourth-generation iPhone SE, the so-called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, and low-end iPads next year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-three-year-modem-road-map-company-plans-to-beat-qualcomm-by-2027"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Apple-iPhone-SE-4-5G-Modem-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892009" /><br/>
A new iPhone SE, iPad Air, and entry-level iPad are expected to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/">as early as March</a>, while the iPhone 17 Air should be released in September.<br/>
<br/>
In a detailed report about Apple's modem efforts today, Gurman said the chip will be able to achieve theoretical 5G download speeds of up to 4 Gbps, which would be slower than Qualcomm modems in current iPhones. However, real-world data speeds are far slower regardless, so this may be a non-issue. As previously rumored, Gurman said Apple's first 5G modem <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/apples-first-5g-chip-no-mmwave-rumor/">will not support the ultra-fast 5G standard known as mmWave</a>, but he does expect the chip to maintain support for dual-SIM, dual-standby functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already been secretly testing the new modem on devices deployed to hundreds of employees around the world, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
For now, the modem is not expected to be used in higher-end devices, such as the iPhone 17 Pro models. Apple's switch away from Qualcomm modems will have risks, as solid performance for phone calls and cellular data is crucial. By testing the modem with lower-end products, Apple can mitigate this risk. Early issues with prototypes of the modem, such as excessive heat and power consumption, are said to have been resolved.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the report outlined some advantages of Apple's first modem compared to the Qualcomm chips, including lower power consumption, improved cellular network scanning, and satellite connectivity enhancements.<br/>
<br/>
While designed by Apple, the modem is said to be manufactured by iPhone chipmaker TSMC.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to have been working on its own 5G modem for iPhones since at least 2018, as part of a plan to reduce and eventually eliminate its dependance on Qualcomm. Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/">extended its 5G modem supply agreement</a> with Qualcomm for iPhone launches through March 2027. In line with that timeframe, Gurman said that Apple hopes that its in-house modem will overtake Qualcomm's technology by 2027.<br/>
<br/>
In 2017, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/20/apple-qualcomm-1-billion-lawsuit/">Apple sued Qualcomm</a> over anticompetitive practices and &#36;1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates. The two companies settled the lawsuit in 2019, and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/">acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> that same year. That purchase provided Apple with a portfolio of cellular-related patents to bolster its development.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-5g-modem-plans-report/">Apple&#039;s 5G Modem Expected to Debut in iPhone SE 4, iPhone 17 Air, and Low-End iPads Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-5g-modem-expected-to-debut-in-iphone-se-4-iphone-17-air-and-low-end-ipads-next-year.2444780/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit this week upheld a lower court's dismissal of a lawsuit alleging that Apple illegally deceived customers into paying for iCloud storage, according to a <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/24-715/24-715-2024-12-04.html">court filing</a>. The decision was reported <a href="https://www.law360.com/technology/articles/2269521/apple-beats-icloud-storage-consumer-claims-at-9th-circ-">by <em>Law360</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iCloud-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803318" /><br/>
The lawsuit alleged that Apple deceived customers into purchasing iCloud-enabled devices by misleading customers into believing that they can easily keep their iCloud storage usage below the free 5GB limit. In reality, the plaintiffs alleged that users quickly exceed this limit and then must pay for increasingly costly <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108047">iCloud storage plans</a>. In the U.S., these plans range from 50GB for &#36;0.99 per month to 12TB for &#36;59.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
In the ruling, three Ninth Circuit judges said the plaintiffs failed to establish that it is "virtually impossible" for them to reduce their storage, or that they will inevitably be forced to pay for iCloud storage. In fact, two named plaintiffs were still on the 5GB tier. The judges added that customers have the option to turn off iCloud at any time.<br/>
<br/>
The case had been dismissed by a U.S. district court in Northern California back <a href="https://casetext.com/case/rutter-v-apple-inc">in May 2022</a>, and now the appeal to the Ninth Circuit has been dismissed. Barring the extremely unlikely event that the plaintiffs are able to successfully petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, the lawsuit is now over. However, Apple is still facing other iCloud-related lawsuits <a href="https://www.classaction.org/media/gamboa-v-apple-inc.pdf">in both the U.S.</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/apple-uk-lawsuit-trapping-icloud-customers/">and U.K.</a>, as complaints about the 5GB tier persist.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched iCloud in 2011, and the service has been available with 5GB of storage for free since then. By today's standards, 5GB is a low amount of storage, and Apple not increasing the free limit has long been a point of contention.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-defeats-icloud-5gb-storage-lawsuit/">Apple Defeats Lawsuit Related to iCloud&#039;s Measly 5GB of Free Storage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-defeats-lawsuit-related-to-iclouds-measly-5gb-of-free-storage.2444768/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

All bands are in brand new condition and come with a one year Apple limited warranty.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/apple-watch-bands.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980992" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Woot. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if you purchase multiple bands and your order exceeds &#36;39, you can use the code <strong>APPLEBANDS</strong> to get an <strong>extra 15 percent off your order</strong>. This sale will end later tonight, or until they sell out, so act soon if you're interested.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-13144945?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Fcategory%2Felectronics%2Fphones-accessories%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_cdet_elec_2"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO 70% OFF</div>Apple Watch Bands at Woot</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Shoppers should note that this sale is focused on colors of the Braided Solo Loop and Solo Loop that Apple has stopped selling, and it doesn't include any of the new band colors. That being said, all of the bands in this sale are in new condition.<br/>
<br/>
The entire sale is focused on Solo Loop and Braided Solo Loop Apple Watch bands, so you'll need to know the size that works best for you before you buy. Apple has a measurement tool <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXY33AM/A/42mm-denim-braided-solo-loop-size-0">on its website</a> that you can use to determine your exact size.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft has discontinued its Surface Studio 2+, marking the end of the company's only direct competitor to Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, leaving a gap in the Windows ecosystem for high-end all-in-one PCs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/11/surface-studio-4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-533717" /><br/>
Microsoft has confirmed to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/surface/the-surface-studio-is-dead-microsoft-ends-production-on-surface-studio-2-as-stock-dwindles"><em>Windows Central</em></a> that it has ended production of the Surface Studio 2+, a premium all-in-one desktop designed for creative professionals. With remaining stock now limited to retailers and partners, there is likely no successor to the Studio 2+ planned. This effectively ends Microsoft's efforts to compete in the high-end all-in-one market dominated by Apple's &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, a fixture of creative workspaces for decades.<br/>
<br/>
First introduced in 2016, the Surface Studio formed an attempt to challenge Apple's hold on the creative professional market. Its standout feature was a 28-inch 4.5K PixelSense touchscreen mounted on a unique hinge that allowed the display to tilt into a flat, drafting-table position. Paired with accessories like the Surface Dial and Surface Pen, the Studio was designed to attract graphic designers, illustrators, and video editors. Despite its innovative design, the Surface Studio struggled to gain significant traction due to its steep price point, which started at &#36;2,999 for the original model, and its reliance on hardware components that were frequently a generation behind current industry standards.<br/>
<br/>
It's also notable that Microsoft has discontinued other Surface products such as the Surface Duo and Surface Earbuds. In recent years, Microsoft has pivoted toward productivity-focused hardware, such as its Surface Pro and Surface Laptop lines, and enterprise-oriented services like its Copilot AI tools. Meanwhile, Apple has continued to update the ever-popular &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with new hardware, most recently with the M4 chip, new color options, a 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage and Desk View, and a nano-texture display option.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft's decision to discontinue the Surface Studio line could leave a void in the Windows all-in-one market. While companies like HP and Lenovo continue to produce all-in-one PCs, none match the Surface Studio's combination of touch capabilities, drafting-table functionality, and premium design. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft-surface/">Microsoft Surface</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft-surface-studio/">Microsoft Surface Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/surface/">Surface</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/microsoft-discontinues-imac-rival-surface-studio/">Microsoft Discontinues iMac Rival Surface Studio 2+</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-discontinues-imac-rival-surface-studio-2.2444763/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[TSMC has achieved better-than-expected results in trial production of its 2-nanometer chip technology, with yield rates exceeding 60%, according to Taiwanese supply chain sources (via <em><a href="https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/paper/1680811">Liberty Times Net</a></em>). The news suggests the company is well-positioned to begin 2nm mass production in 2025, which could see its use in Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models the following year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tsmc_semiconductor_chip_inspection_678x452.jpg" alt="" width="678" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756102" /><br/>
The semiconductor manufacturer is reportedly conducting risk trial production at its Baoshan facility in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, where it has implemented a new nanosheet architecture that promises a significant advancement over the current 3nm FinFET process. The company plans to transfer this production experience to its Kaohsiung plant for mass manufacturing, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC's progress bodes well for Apple, with a September report from analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/kuo-iphone-17-3nm-chips/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and a more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/iphone-18-enhanced-2nm-chip-12gb-ram/">recent rumor</a> claiming that Apple's 2026 iPhone 18 Pro models will exclusively feature chips built on TSMC's 2nm process and 12GB of RAM. The standard iPhone 18 models are expected to continue using an enhanced 3nm process due to cost considerations.<br/>
<br/>
The 2nm process is said to be generating substantial interest from potential customers, particularly in the AI sector. Indeed, company CEO C.C. Wei has noted unexpectedly high demand for the upcoming 2nm technology, suggesting production at scale will be ramped up as soon as is possible to meet that demand.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC's roadmap includes the 2026 introduction of an A16 process (1.6nm-class – not to be confused with Apple's chip nomenclature), which will combine Super Power Rail (SPR) architecture with nanosheet transistors. SPR is expected to provide an 8% to 10% performance increase at the same voltage and complexity, a 15% to 20% power demand decrease at the same frequency and transistor count, and a 7% to 10% chip density increase, depending on the design.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/tsmc-2nm-chip-production-on-track-iphone-18-pro/">TSMC 2nm Chip Production Hits 60% Yield, on Track for iPhone 18 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tsmc-2nm-chip-production-hits-60-yield-on-track-for-iphone-18-pro.2444759/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation iPhone 17 lineup may bring some of the most significant display improvements we've seen in recent years. While the iPhone 17 series isn't expected until late 2025, multiple rumors suggest Apple is working on substantial screen upgrades across its entire smartphone range.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/iPhone-14-Pro-Display-Two-Times-Brighter-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2504" height="1408" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862901" /><br/>
From enhanced refresh rates to advanced materials and improved power efficiency, these display changes could mark a notable shift in Apple's iPhone strategy. Here's a look at five major display upgrades reportedly coming to the iPhone 17 lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bigger Displays</h2><br/>
Apple may introduce a new display size for the standard iPhone 17 in 2025, increasing the screen size from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches, matching the size of the iPhone 16 Pro. Rumors suggest the Plus model will be discontinued, leaving a single lower-cost option in the lineup. At 6.3 inches, this device would fall between the current 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus in size. If these changes occur, the iPhone 17 lineup could feature a 6.3-inch standard model, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">6.6-inch slim "Air" model</a>, a 6.3-inch Pro model, and a 6.9-inch Pro Max model, offering a range of sizes to suit different preferences.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>120Hz ProMotion Across the Lineup</h2><br/>
Apple intends to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/">expand</a> ProMotion to all iPhone models in 2025, allowing all models to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/ltpo-for-all-iphone-17-models-report/">ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate</a> for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Previously, only "Pro" models in Apple's iPhone lineup have had the feature. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor/">iPhone 17 "Air"</a> to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Power-Efficient Screens</h2><br/>
A recent <a href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1863866205045727481">unconfirmed rumor</a> suggests that Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models may feature a new display technology known as Low-Dielectric TEE (Transmission Electrically Enhanced). The term likely refers to the use of materials with a low dielectric constant in the display's thin-film encapsulation (TFE). While it's not yet clear what this specific innovation offers, incorporating low-dielectric materials can in general reduce signal interference and energy loss, leading to more efficient power usage and potentially longer battery life. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Scratch Resistant Anti-Reflective Display</h2><br/>
The iPhone 17 will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">according to one rumor</a>. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 is said to have a "super-hard anti-reflective layer" that is "more scratch-resistant." It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor. That said, it's worth keeping in mind that the new iPhone 16 Pro models have the latest-generation Ceramic Shield, which has an advanced formulation that is 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smaller Dynamic Island</h2><br/>
Apple's iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a significantly narrower Dynamic Island, thanks to the device's adoption of a smaller "metalens" for the Face ID system, claims <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">Haitong's Jeff Pu</a>. While a traditional iPhone camera has curved lenses that redirect light towards the image sensor, a metalens is a thin and flat lens with microscopic patterns etched onto it that can focus light more precisely. Assuming this results in a narrowed Dynamic Island, it would be the first time that Apple has changed the feature since it debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/five-rumored-iphone-17-display-upgrades/">Every Display Upgrade Rumored for Apple&#039;s iPhone 17</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/every-display-upgrade-rumored-for-apples-iphone-17.2444758/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS Notification Summaries Lost in Translation? How to Turn Them Off</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 18.1, Apple has introduced AI-powered notification summarization across all apps, which means your iPhone will automatically condense your alerts to show just the key details. The feature aims to reduce notification overload, but it doesn't always work as advertised. Keep reading to learn how to manage the feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/apple-intelligence-fails.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980967" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credits: r/AppleIntelligenceFail</em></div><br/>
Powered by Apple Intelligence, the new summarization feature works by analyzing notification content and creating more concise versions that highlight the most important information. By default, it's enabled for compatible apps after you complete the initial setup process in iOS 18.1.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple's AI summaries offer convenience, they've also produced some unexpectedly funny results. The system's struggle with emotional context and tone detection has led to some particularly amusing recap fails. As recorded in places like the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleIntelligenceFail/?rdt=42730">r/AppleIntelligenceFail</a>, when the algorithm misinterprets sarcasm, combines unrelated notifications, or fails to grasp logic, the results can be surprisingly entertaining (or not, depending on your sense of humor). <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Customize or Disable Notification Summaries</h2><br/>
Whether you've been tickled or confused by summaries, or they just don't appeal to your workflow, fortunately you can disable the feature entirely or customize which apps use the feature. This gives you complete control over how your notifications appear on the Lock Screen and in Notification Center on your iPhone.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li><br/>
  <li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Notifications</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Summarize Previews</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Toggle off the switch at the top to completely disable <strong>Summarize Previews</strong>. Alternatively, toggle off the switches for individual apps only.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/turn-off-notification-summaries.jpg" alt="settings" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972573" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Things to Know About Notification Summaries</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>Turning off summarization doesn't affect other notification settings like grouping or Focus modes.</li><br/>
  <li>The feature only works on devices that support Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models, M-series iPads, iPad mini 7, and Macs with Apple silicon).</li><br/>
  <li>Disabling summaries returns notifications to their standard format immediately.</li><br/>
  <li>You can re-enable summarization at any time through Settings.</li><br/>
</ul>Keep in mind that notification summaries are separate from the Notification Summary feature that delivers scheduled batches of notifications at specific times. While they may seem similar, they serve different purposes in helping you manage your notifications more effectively.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-turn-off-notification-summaries/">iOS Notification Summaries Lost in Translation?

		<description><![CDATA[A Brazilian federal court has overturned an antitrust ruling that would have required Apple to allow third-party payment systems in the App Store within 20 days. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/app-store-awards-2022.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876046" /><br/>
The initial ruling, issued on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/26/brazil-apple-lift-third-party-app-payment-limits/">November 26</a>, came in response to a 2022 complaint from Latin American e-commerce platform MercadoLibre. The regulator had ordered Apple to remove restrictions on alternative payment systems and allow developers to market different payment options for in-app purchases, threatening daily fines of &#36;43,000 for non-compliance.<br/>
<br/>
But Judge Eduardo Santos da Rocha Penteado of the 14th Federal Civil Court on Thursday called the original decision by Brazil's competition regulator (Cade) "disproportionate and unnecessary."<br/>
<br/>
In his decision, Penteado acknowledged that the measures demanded by Cade would "change, in a sensitive and structural way" Apple's business operations. He said that the technical complexity of the required changes and the global regulatory landscape, particularly similar decisions in the European Union, warranted a more thorough discussion.<br/>
<br/>
The decision came hours after reports emerged of Apple appealing the original order, with the company arguing that the required changes were too complex to implement within the given time frame.<br/>
<br/>
While the injunction has been overturned, the broader antitrust investigation into Apple's App Store practices will continue. Cade is expected to appeal the court's decision, and Apple could still eventually be required to implement changes to its App Store policies in Brazil.<br/>
<br/>
The case follows similar regulatory challenges Apple faces globally, including a recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">€1.8 billion fine</a> from the European Commission over music streaming app restrictions. Apple has maintained throughout that the Brazilian regulator's demands would threaten user privacy and security.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI today announced the launch of ChatGPT Pro, a &#36;200 per month subscription service that provides unlimited access to <a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/">OpenAI o1</a>, the company's newest and most advanced large language model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/open-ai-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1093" height="615" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953560" /><br/>
The plan includes unlimited use of OpenAI o1, o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Voice, along with o1 pro mode, an o1 version that uses more compute to provide better answers to the hardest problems. In the future, ChatGPT Pro will gain "more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features."<br/>
<br/>
The OpenAI o1 pro mode takes significantly more compute power to solve complex problems, which is why OpenAI is charging such a high fee. OpenAI says that o1 thinks longer for the "most reliable responses," performing better on ML benchmarks across math, science, and coding.<br/>
<br/>
According to OpenAI, ChatGPT Pro is aimed at researchers, engineers, and other individuals who use research-grade intelligence on a daily basis.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/05/openai-launches-200-month-chatgpt-pro-plan/">OpenAI Launches &#36;200/Month ChatGPT Pro Plan</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-launches-200-month-chatgpt-pro-plan.2444730/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Meross Debuts &#36;70 Matter-Enabled Smart Thermostat</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Smart home company Meross today announced the launch of the <a href="https://shop.meross.com/products/matter-smart-thermostat-mts300ma?ref=HZfLkN8e1BqP">Meross Matter Smart Home Thermostat</a>, which can connect to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> setup using the Matter protocol. At &#36;70 for a limited time, the device is an affordable &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; thermostat option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/meross-matter-thermostat.jpg" alt="" width="999" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980932" /><br/>
The Smart Thermostat features a minimalist design with a white glass panel that has LEDs that show the temperature and other settings. It requires a C wire for power, and Meross says that it should work with 95 percent of heating and cooling systems in North America, including single and multi-stage furnaces, boilers, air conditioners, heat pumps, and fan coil units.<br/>
<br/>
Because the thermostat integrates with &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj;, temperature can be controlled through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands, in the Apple Home app, or in the Meross app. There are also touch controls on the device itself.<br/>
<br/>
Heating and cooling usage are tracked in the Meross app, and there is an option to save energy costs with a smart schedule that changes the temperature when people are away from home. It can also be used in automations with other &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; products.<br/>
<br/>
Because the thermostat is Matter-enabled, it can also be controlled by Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings provided an appropriate Matter hub is available. Matter devices are able to be controlled by multiple ecosystems, which is useful in households where not everyone has an Apple device.<br/>
<br/>
Meross plans to charge &#36;99.99 for the Smart Thermostat, but <a href="https://shop.meross.com/products/matter-smart-thermostat-mts300ma?ref=HZfLkN8e1BqP">it is currently available</a> at a discounted &#36;70 price.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/matter/">Matter</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/05/meross-matter-thermostat/">Meross Debuts &#36;70 Matter-Enabled Smart Thermostat</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meross-debuts-70-matter-enabled-smart-thermostat.2444728/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
