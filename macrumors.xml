		<description><![CDATA[Apple has had its software update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 devices in France approved by regulators, after the company threatened to suspend sales of the phones earlier this month due to radiation levels (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/french-authorities-approve-apples-software-update-its-iphone-12-2023-09-29/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>

In early September, France <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/france-orders-end-to-iphone-12-sales-radiation/">ordered</a> Apple to halt ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 12 sales and "fix" existing devices to bring them into electromagnetic radiation compliance with European standards. The increase in emitted electromagnetic radiation observed over time by regulators appears to have been the result of successive software updates issued by Apple, and was not present when the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 12 was launched in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
The ANFR ordered Apple to "remove the ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 12‌ from the French market from September 12 due to the model exceeding the limit" for electromagnetic absorption by the body. The agency also told Apple to recall every ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 12‌ it has ever sold in the country. Ministers later said that though the radiation level was above the accepted standard, it was not dangerous and people were safe to continue using the phones, local media reported.<br/>
<br/>
Apple later said it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-iphone-12-software-update-france-radiation/">issue a software update</a> for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 users in France to address the radiation concerns. The French regulator ANFR responded by saying it would test the software update. If it made a difference to the electromagnetic waves the device emitted, ANFR said it would bring the model into compliance with European standards applied in France, and the marketing withdrawal order would be lifted.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/france/">France</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/apple-software-update-approved-iphone-12-france/">Apple iOS Update to Fix iPhone 12 Radiation Levels Approved by French Regulators</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ios-update-to-fix-iphone-12-radiation-levels-approved-by-french-regulators.2405456/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Watch Series 9 Buyer&#039;s Guide: How Incremental Upgrades Stack Up Over the Years</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch has received some incremental updates in recent years, with significant upgrades becoming fewer and farther between as the device has progressed. Since the Apple Watch's generation-over-generation enhancements are relatively small, it is all the more important to consider when an upgrade is justified and whether an older model could suffice for your needs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-Buyers-Guide-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914497" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>'s headline upgrade is the S9 chip, bringing improved performance to the Apple Watch for the first time in four years and facilitating features like Double Tap. It is priced starting at &#36;399. Last year's Series 8 introduced body temperature sensing and Crash Detection, but the last moderately significant update for the device was 2021's Series 7, which introduced larger display sizes and fast-charging capability. All previous Apple Watch models from before the Series 9 have been discontinued, but older models may still be found for even lower prices from third-party retailers or second-hand.<br/>
<br/>
Read on to see the breakdown below for each new feature, change, and improvement that was added with each Apple Watch model compared to its direct predecessor. Viewing each generation's changes in this way helps weigh up the accumulative upgrades one receives by skipping multiple generations when buying a new device, as well as get a sense of which generations offered the biggest overall upgrades.<br/>

The &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; does not seem to provide a meaningful upgrade for most Series 7 and Series 8 users. If you have an Apple Watch Series 6 or older, upgrading to the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; will generally be worthwhile, with plenty of new features across the board. Discounted Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8 models are also a good option for those coming from a Series 6 or older if you are looking to save money.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">considered moving</a> the Apple Watch away from an annual upgrade cycle to offer more substantial updates less frequently. Next year's Apple Watch "Series X" is rumored to be a significant update to mark the tenth anniversary of the device, featuring thinner casings, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/08/apple-watch-series-x-larger-display-rumor/">larger displays</a>, microLED technology, larger batteries, blood pressure monitoring, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">new mechanism</a> for connecting bands.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-generations-compared/">Apple Watch Series 9 Buyer&#039;s Guide: How Incremental Upgrades Stack Up Over the Years</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-buyers-guide-how-incremental-upgrades-stack-up-over-the-years.2405453/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple staff met with Chinese officials in recent months to discuss concerns over new rules that will restrict Apple from offering many foreign apps currently available in its China <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, according to a new paywalled <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-china-met-to-discuss-beijings-crackdown-on-western-apps-2219afcb">Wall Street Journal</a></em> report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833991" /><br/>
China already blocks the websites of many popular Western social media apps like Instagram, X (now Twitter), Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in China can still download the apps from Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; if they use an unauthorized VPN that connects them to an internet server outside the country. China <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/31/russia-bans-vpns-apple-pulls-apps-china/">banned VPN services</a> from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
The five social media apps named above have been downloaded from Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; more than 170 million times in China over the last decade, according to estimates by Sensor Tower.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report, Chinese officials told Apple staff that it must strictly implement rules banning unregistered foreign apps, thereby closing a loophole allowing Chinese &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to download them.<br/>
<br/>
Under new rules issued in July by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Apple will no longer be able to offer such apps in its China &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; from next July unless the app operators are registered with the government. The new rules affect both foreign and domestic app distributors, and aren't specifically targeting Apple.<br/>
<br/>
However, the operators are unlikely to register with the Chinese government, since doing so would force them to comply with data transfer and censorship requirements. Such a scenario would leave Apple with no choice but to remove them or face legal sanctions.<br/>
<br/>
Investors are said to be concerned about how the new rules will affect Apple's services bottom line, which includes &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; transactions. Apple is also said to be concerned about issues the company could face in implementing the rules, such as whether users in China who access foreign apps through its overseas app stores would be able to continue to do so.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report, Apple was told during the recent discussions that the new rules are needed to crack down on online scams, pornography, and the circulation of information that violates China's censorship rules.<br/>
<br/>
China has recently banned government officials from using iPhones and other foreign smartphones for work or from bringing such devices to their government offices, and earlier this month the band was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/china-expanding-government-iphone-ban/">expanded</a> to multiple state agencies and state companies, highlighting China's renewed attempts to block foreign technology.<br/>
<br/>
China is an important market for Apple, with the region accounting for about a fifth of its sales. Most of Apple's manufacturing base remains in the country, despite the company's efforts in recent years to diversify its supply chain to places like Vietnam and India.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/apple-china-discuss-rules-banning-western-apps/">Apple &#039;Concerned&#039; About China&#039;s New App Store Rules Banning Unregistered Foreign Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-concerned-about-chinas-new-app-store-rules-banning-unregistered-foreign-apps.2405451/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Will There Be An Apple Event in October?</title>

		<description><![CDATA[It is typical for Apple to hold up to four events per year: one in the spring, WWDC in June, the fall <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> event, and a fourth fall event that's Mac and/or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> focused. Unfortunately, there are few additional product announcements planned for the final months of 2023, and it's looking like there won't be another fall event this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/ipad-air-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904045" /><br/>
Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> told <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> hosts that he <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/">does not expect</a> Apple to hold an October event because the company does not have enough new products and features to justify it. Major new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Mac launches are not expected until 2024, suggesting it will be a slow holiday season for Apple outside of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
During Apple's August earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said that Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue is expected to drop double digits. Last October, Apple introduced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models and a 10th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, plus it was still seeing sales of the redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> during the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's warning about the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Mac revenue drop suggests that it does not expect to have products to entice customers during the holiday quarter, and that is in line with rumors.<br/>
<br/>
There is a possibility that we will see <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/">at least one iPad</a> unveiled in October, perhaps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/">an iPad mini</a>, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, or an 11th-generation low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, but these will be minor refreshes. &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with OLED displays and M3 chips won't be coming until 2024.<br/>
<br/>
We could also see at least one Mac with a new M3 chip, and this could be a &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, 13-inch MacBook Pro, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, or a 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>. Gurman said that if these products do come out in 2023, Apple is likely to unveil them via press release rather than with an event.<br/>
<br/>
While Gurman believes M3 Macs could come out in 2023, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said recently that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">will not launch</a> new MacBook models with M3 processors before the end of the year, which may narrow down any M3 Mac releases to desktop models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not hold an October event last year, but there were October events in 2013, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2021.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-october-event-possibility/">Will There Be An Apple Event in October?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-there-be-an-apple-event-in-october.2405390/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

As reported by <em><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2023/09/27/disney-plus-canada-password-sharing-crackdown-november-2023/">Mobile Syrup</a></em>, Disney is updating its terms of service to restrict account sharing.<blockquote>"Unless otherwise permitted by your Service Tier, you may not share your subscription outside of your household. "Household" means the collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside therein. Additional usage rules may apply for certain Service Tiers.</blockquote>Disney CEO Bob Iger said back in August that Disney would "roll out tactics" to end password sharing starting in 2024, but it appears the crackdown will come sooner in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Disney's streaming division experienced a &#36;512 million loss in the third fiscal quarter of 2023, and Iger has been aiming to cut down on the company's streaming costs. Disney's ad-free Disney+ and Hulu plans also recently went up in price, with ad-free Disney+ priced at &#36;13.99 per month in the United States and ad-free Hulu priced at &#36;17.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
While Disney plans to put a stop to password sharing in Canada first, it is undoubtedly a change that will also roll out to the United States and other countries. Netflix this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/09/netflix-password-crackdown-subscriber-increase/">eliminated password sharing</a> between households, implementing restrictions through IP address and location. Netflix saw a notable increase in signups when it eliminated password sharing, so it is not a surprise to see other streaming services implementing similar crackdowns.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/">Disney Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/disney-password-sharing-crackdown/">Disney+ to Start Cracking Down on Password Sharing in November</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-to-start-cracking-down-on-password-sharing-in-november.2405378/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Back in 2020, Microsoft considered selling its Bing search engine to Apple, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-28/microsoft-discussed-selling-bing-to-apple-as-google-replacement">Bloomberg</a></em>. Had the acquisition happened, Bing would have replaced Google as the default search engine on Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/microsoft-bing-chatgpt.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884498" /><br/>
Microsoft executives met up with Apple services chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> to discuss a potential deal, but the talks were just exploratory and did not progress. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple did not move forward with a deal because of the money that it earns from Google and because it was concerned that Bing could not compete with Google in "quality and capabilities."<br/>
<br/>
Google's search engine has long been the default search engine on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac, and Google pays Apple billions of dollars per year for the privilege. Google and Apple last inked a deal in 2021, facilitated by Cue, and as of 2020, Apple was collecting &#36;4 billion and &#36;7 billion annually from Google. The Apple/Google deal has been under scrutiny this week due to the antitrust trial between Google and the U.S Department of Justice, with the DoJ pointing toward Google's dominance on Apple devices as evidence that Google has a search engine monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Eddy Cue&zwnj; this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/">had to testify in the trial</a>, and he explained why Google is the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s default search engine. "We make Google be the default search engine because we've always thought it was the best," Cue said. He went on to say that Apple has not gone with another search engine provider because there is no "valid alternative."<br/>
<br/>
While Google is the default search engine on Apple devices, users can choose to swap to Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Ecosia as an alternative. Bing has recently become a more popular search engine option thanks to Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and the integration of chatbot technology.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/">Microsoft Considered Selling Bing to Apple in 2020</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-considered-selling-bing-to-apple-in-2020.2405372/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple added a USB-C port to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup this year, allowing it to work with USB-C cables, USB-C power banks, and more. It turns out that some USB-C battery packs are not working properly with Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, resulting in charging issues.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Keynote.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911041" /><br/>
As highlighted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone15Pro/comments/16rtpvf/i_plugged_my_iphone_15_pro_into_this_brand_new/">on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anker-power-bank-not-charging-15pm-due-to-reverse-charging.2403990/">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, not all existing USB-C power banks can be used with the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, perhaps due to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s reverse charging feature. In some cases, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; will fail to charge, or the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; will charge the power bank.<br/>
<br/>
A range of different power banks are affected, and because of the wide number of them on the market, it is impossible to list the models that are non-functional. One version that fails to work is the Anker PowerCore Slim 10K PD, and a customer who contacted Anker was told that the only way to get the power bank to charge the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is to use the USB-A port.<br/>
<blockquote>It seems that due to the iPhone 15 series' reverse charging function, the USB C's port charging of Anker PowerCore Slim 10k PD will be influenced, which does not have a solution currently. The only way to get your iPhone charged is to use the USB A port.<br/>
<br/>
Anker will do more tests on all of our power banks to see whether this is the issue with certain power banks and try to get a solution.</blockquote><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are able to charge an Apple Watch, AirPods, or another &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; through the USB-C port, and there is a possibility that this functionality is what's impacting some power banks. Most USB-C power banks with Power Delivery seem to be working as intended, including a number of models tested by <em>MacRumors</em>, but &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; owners should be aware that some could be incompatible.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-usb-c-power-banks/">Some USB-C Power Banks Fail to Work With iPhone 15</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-usb-c-power-banks-fail-to-work-with-iphone-15.2405365/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/16tqihd/settings_updateschanges_to_ad_personalization/">this week announced</a> that it will no longer allow Reddit users to opt out of ad personalization, which means that ads on the platform will be targeted based on site usage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/reddit-app-icon.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-792796" /><br/>
Right now, users can choose to toggle off an option to "personalize ads based on your Reddit activity and account info," but this toggle is being removed going forward. Reddit claims that it requires "very little personal information" and the change will be able to predict ads that are more relevant to each person.<blockquote>Reddit requires very little personal information, and we like it that way. Our advertisers instead rely on on-platform activity--what communities you join, leave, upvotes, downvotes, and other signals--to get an idea of what you might be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of redditors will see no change to their ads on Reddit. For users who previously opted out of personalization based on Reddit activity, this change will not result in seeing more ads or sharing on-platform activity with advertisers. It does enable our models to better predict which ad may be most relevant to you.</blockquote>Reddit claims that the "vast majority" of Reddit users will not see changes to their ads, nor will users be seeing more ads. With no option to opt-out of ad personalization, Reddit is adding new toggles to limit ads from specific categories, including Alcohol, Dating, Gambling, Pregnancy &amp; Parenting, and Weight Loss. Machine learning will be used to classify ads, so users will not be able to opt out of these ad categories entirely.<br/>
<br/>
In select countries, the option to turn off ad personalization will remain, allowing Reddit to continue to comply with GDPR restrictions. Reddit users without the option to turn off ad targeting can expect to see ads that are based on subreddits they belong to, content that is upvoted, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Reddit earlier this year made changes to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/08/apollo-shutting-down-june-30/">the cost of its API</a>, cutting out <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/apollo-app-shutting-down-today/">almost all third-party apps</a> and forcing the majority of users to view Reddit on the website or on the Reddit app, both of which support ads.<br/>
<br/>
Reddit says that these ad changes started rolling out yesterday.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/reddit/">Reddit</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/reddit-personalized-ads/">PSA: Reddit is Forcing Users to Accept Personalized Ads</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-reddit-is-forcing-users-to-accept-personalized-ads.2405359/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, the company behind popular video game Fortnite, is laying off 830 employees or approximately 16 percent of its workforce. The layoffs come amid Epic's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/epic-games-supreme-court/">ongoing legal battle with Apple</a>, which started way back in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite_apple_featured.jpg" alt="" width="2140" height="1204" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-754674" /><br/>
Just this week, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/epic-games-supreme-court/">asked the Supreme Court to hear the case</a>, a request that follows two major losses and likely hundreds of thousands or more in legal fees. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; has been trying to paint Apple as a monopolist, and it wants to be able to sell digital skins and other goods to Apple customers without having to pay a cut to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
As a result of the legal dispute, Fortnite has been unavailable from Apple's App Stores for several years now, and those who want to play the game on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> must seek alternate means to do so, such as web-based platforms.<br/>
<br/>
Epic CEO Tim Sweeney in a memo sent out to employees and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/layoffs-at-epic">shared on the company's website</a> said that it has been "spending way more money" than it earns to grow Fortnite, and other efforts to cut costs have "ended up far short of financial sustainability."<br/>
<br/>
Sweeney says that layoffs are the only way to stabilize the company's finances. Employees will be provided with severance that includes six months of base pay and six months of paid healthcare.<br/>
<br/>
As for the fight against Apple, Sweeney claims that &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; is taking steps to cut down on legal expenses, but will continue on with its legal battles so the "metaverse can thrive and bring opportunity to Epic and all other developers."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/epic-games-layoffs/">Epic Games Lays Off Over 800 Employees as Apple Legal Battle Drags On</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-lays-off-over-800-employees-as-apple-legal-battle-drags-on.2405337/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to try out the software ahead of its release. The public iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 betas come a day after Apple released the betas for developers.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912331" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
In the iOS 17.1 beta, Apple added an option to favorite songs, albums, playlists, artists, and more, from within <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and through the Now Playing widget.<br/>
<br/>
AirDrop transfers can now be finished over the internet after being initiated, and when you activate the flashlight, there's an indicator in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> even if you don't have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or Pro Max.

<br/>
Apple has also released a new beta of tvOS 17.1 with the same &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; changes, plus there is a public beta of watchOS 10.1 available for public beta testers. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/watchos-10-1-beta-namedrop-apple-watch/">watchOS 10.1 enables NameDrop</a> on Apple Watch for sharing contact information with other Apple Watch and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users over AirDrop. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-public-beta-1/">Apple Releases First Betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to Public Beta Testers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-first-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-public-beta-testers.2405314/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

The dispute between Apple and Epic <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/">dates back to 2020</a> with Epic seeking to overturn Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules requiring content purchases within iOS apps to go through Apple, which takes a 15% to 30% cut of the revenue.<br/>
<br/>
In multiple rounds of the dispute, Apple has won on every count with the exception of one regarding Apple's "anti-steering" rule that bars developers of many iOS apps from directing users to methods of purchase available outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, circumventing Apple's revenue cut.<br/>
<br/>
Apple had said it was considering appealing the ruling over its anti-steering provision to the Supreme Court, and back in July a judge ruled that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/app-store-rule-change-epic-games-delayed/">did not have to make changes to its policies</a> pending the potential appeal, which has now been filed.<br/>
<br/>
The Supreme Court will decide in the coming months whether it will hear either or both of Epic's and Apple's appeals, but if it does not take up either petition, the previous rulings will stand. Apple would be able to continue to disallow third-party payment processing within apps but would have to allow developers to inform users about other purchasing options outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-epic-appeal-supreme-court/">Apple Appeals Epic Games Ruling Over &#039;Anti-Steering&#039; Provisions to U.S. Supreme Court</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-appeals-epic-games-ruling-over-anti-steering-provisions-to-u-s-supreme-court.2405291/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17.1 Adds Custom Playlist Art Options to Apple Music</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple added a new feature to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> app in the first beta of iOS 17.1 that offers a selection of color-matched playlist artwork options for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17-Playlist-Artwork-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914404" /><br/>
As of beta one, Apple provides eight different artwork styles featuring geometric shapes and gradients, with the title of the playlist in the top left corner. The colors used in the artwork are picked from the album artwork of whatever song is first in the playlist. The default artwork continues to be the tiled album artwork of the first four songs in a playlist and the ability to choose a custom image from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> or Files remains.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, users had to keep the basic tiled image or upload a custom image. Since not all users have custom graphics or photos they want to use for playlists and the default artwork is relatively simple, playlists can be difficult to identify and look fairly generic. Now, users can quickly and easily set a unique appearance for each playlist that fits in with &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s UI.<br/>
<br/>
Other &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; changes and improvements in iOS 17.1 include favoriting songs from the Lock Screen and suggested songs in playlists. The ability for multiple users to collaborate on and add to the same playlist and &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; SharePlay for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> are also expected to be added in a future update. iOS 17.1 introduces a host of new features, including NameDrop to Apple Watch, UK <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">bank balances in the Wallet app</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/">more</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/custom-apple-music-playlist-art-options/">iOS 17.1 Adds Custom Playlist Art Options to Apple Music</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-adds-custom-playlist-art-options-to-apple-music.2405286/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max overheating concerns continue to make headlines this week, with the topic <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-new-iphone-15-overheat-dbd5171a">highlighted by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-27/apple-iphone-15-pro-users-complain-that-device-can-get-too-hot"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Both of the reports document anecdotal complaints from customers, and outline potential causes, but it's unclear how many devices are actually affected. <em>Bloomberg</em> said the overheating could be caused or compounded by the iPhone's setup process, suggesting that the higher temperatures might sometimes be a temporary condition. <br/>
<br/>
<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> quoted a customer who felt his iPhone 15 Pro Max remained hotter than his iPhone 13 Pro Max a few days after setting up the device:<blockquote>Thomas Galvin, a 23-year-old from Cleveland, says his iPhone 15 Pro Max has been "super hot" and that he is considering returning it. Apple customer support told him the heat was a result of setting up the new phone, but even a few days later, it is still "way worse than the iPhone 13 Pro Max," he said.</blockquote><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern said her iPhone 15 Pro Max did heat up while charging and performing processor-intensive tasks, such as gaming, but she said her iPhone 14 Pro Max reached similar temperatures in the same test. During typical everyday usage, Stern said the temperature of both devices was in a normal range. Many customers on social media have also said their iPhone 15 Pro is not experiencing any overheating, and the lack of hard data makes it unclear if there is a widespread problem.<br/>
<br/>
On Wednesday, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the titanium frame on iPhone 15 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/iphone-15-pro-overheating/">negatively impacts thermal efficiency</a>. Kuo believes that Apple will likely address the issue through software updates, but he said improvements may be limited unless Apple lowers the performance of the A17 Pro chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not commented on the concerns, and it's unclear if the company will actually make any software optimizations in future iOS updates.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">iPhone 15 Pro Overheating Concerns Highlighted in Two More Reports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-overheating-concerns-highlighted-in-two-more-reports.2405278/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An Apple-acquired company now renamed "Apple Payments Services" is likely behind the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">UK-exclusive Apple Wallet features</a> in iOS 17.1, potentially hinting that Apple has plans to launch additional financial services in the country.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/credit-kudos-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840785" /><br/>
Last year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/23/apple-acquires-uk-banking-startup/">Apple acquired Credit Kudos</a>, a UK open banking startup that sought to help lenders make better decisions. <em>MacRumors</em> has now learned  that Apple filed to change the name of Credit Kudos to Apple Payments Services Limited in July. "Credit Kudos" is now simply a trading name of Apple Payments Services.<br/>
<br/>
Credit Kudos offered insights and scores based on loan applications drawn from transaction and loan outcome banking data, sourced by the UK's open banking framework. The ability to see account balances directly in Apple Wallet is a new UK-exclusive feature in iOS 17.1, powered by the country's regulated open banking API. Since Credit Kudos' expertise focused on UK open banking, it seems highly likely that last year's acquisition is behind the new feature. <br/>
<br/>
It is not clear what Apple has planned for Credit Kudos' technology in the future, but it is almost certain that it extends beyond balance visibility in Apple Wallet, especially considering Apple paid £131 million (&#36;170 million) for the company in March 2022. The relatively recent decision to rename the company to Apple Payments Services similarly suggests that the company's work is ongoing. <em>MacRumors</em> understands that 31 employees left Credit Kudos following Apple's acquisition, but a team of over a dozen employees, as well as co-founder and CEO Freddy Kelly, remain at the company. <br/>
<br/>
Credit Kudos's API offered lenders a way to get faster, automated decision-making about loans with reduced risk and higher rates of acceptance. It is therefore plausible that the company's technology could aid Apple with the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> in the UK. The UK is among Apple's most important markets, with the country possessing the largest number of Apple Stores outside the United States and China, and new features and services are often first to reach the UK after launching in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's main credit product, &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, is available exclusively in the United States. It is possible that Apple could modify Credit Kudos's technology to work with the U.S.'s growing open banking sector to strengthen &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;'s credit checker, but Apple could also use it to credit check &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; applications in the UK directly since Credit Kudos is a licensed credit reference agency.<br/>
<br/>
Credit markets and financial regulation vary massively in countries around the world, so it would not be straightforward for Apple to launch &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; internationally. Apple would likely need to seek specific solutions to make lending decisions in each country, so it seems plausible that Credit Kudos could be the chosen credit checking platform for the UK.<br/>
<br/>
Following the success of &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; in the U.S., it could make sense for Apple to expand into overseas markets. While visiting Germany in 2019, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/30/tim-cook-visits-germany/">confirmed his interest</a> in launching &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; internationally.<br/>
<br/>
Apple often acquires smaller businesses to bolster its technologies and expertise without obviously or immediately rolling it into a product or service. On the other hand, many acquisitions do go on to be key parts of Apple's ecosystem.

		<description><![CDATA[<em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera picked up a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max on launch day, and he spent the last four days using it non-stop to give <em>MacRumors</em> readers an idea of how the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> experience is going and his first thoughts on the features Apple added this year.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SGZ_9Q2Pnfg?si=DvZ5K7RCkULejY05" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
There have been complaints about the new &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/iphone-15-pro-overheating/">getting too hot</a>, but other than a heat issue when using an uncertified USB-C cable to connect to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, Dan hasn't run into trouble and he hasn't seen overheating problems. The same is true for the rest of us at <em>MacRumors</em> - our iPhones appear to be functioning as intended and running cool following the initial setup and syncing period.<br/>
<br/>
With the switch to titanium, Apple lowered the weight of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, plus added contoured edges that are much more comfortable to hold. Dan says that this is one of the most notable changes for him, and it makes picking up an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> downright uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life has been solid, but the Action Button is a work in progress and it can take some time to figure out what's most useful. We'll have a dedicated Action Button video coming sometime in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
As for the camera, it's unsurprisingly pretty great. 24-megapixel photos make a difference, and the 5x Telephoto lens is an improvement over the prior 3x version. We're also planning an in-depth camera comparison, so stay tuned for that.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17.1, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/">currently in beta</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the UK can now view the account balance of their bank cards and credit cards right within Apple's Wallet app. Keep reading to learn how it works.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/uk-bank-account-apple-wallet-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914320" /><br/>
Apple's Wallet app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has been able to display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> transactions made using your bank and credit cards for a while now, but if you are a Wallet app user in the United Kingdom, a new integration in iOS 17.1 means you can view your current account balance from your bank, along with a history of your deposits and payments. If you have a credit card, you can also view your remaining credit.<br/>
<br/>
To get the additional account information, your bank needs to support the Open Banking API that Apple has implemented. Supporting banks currently include Barclays, Monzo, Startling, HSBC, Lloyds, and RBS, with more banks likely to come on board when iOS 17.1 is released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
The following steps show you how integration is securely authorized through the Wallet app. It's a simple enough process, and Apple will automatically redirect you to your bank app to authenticate the connection. Note that until iOS 17.1 is officially released, <strong>the iOS 17.1 developer beta must be installed on your iPhone</strong> for this to work.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Wallet app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap a card from a supporting bank.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Get Started</strong> under "See Balances and Full Transaction History for This Account."</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Continue</strong> to connect your account to Wallet.</li><br/>
<li>Check the account details that you are about to give Wallet permission to access, then tap <strong>Continue</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>In your bank app, enter your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s passcode or use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> to grant Wallet permission to access the specified account details.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet.jpg" alt="" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914317" /><br/>
<br/>
After following these steps, you'll be directed back to the Wallet app, where you will now see the available balance of your account underneath the bank card, along with your transaction history. If it's a credit card, you'll also see the remaining balance available, while a tap on the balance will also reveal your credit limit.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Wallet also keeps annual transaction histories for linked accounts. You can access them for each account in <strong>Settings -> Wallet & Apple Pay</strong>: Tap the connected account under "Connections," tap the card under "Accounts," then tap <strong>Account Activity</strong>, where you can view transactions by year.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple users in the UK still unable to make use of Apple Cash or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, it's nice to see Apple exclusively supporting a British banking standard in its Wallet app. Note that Open Banking is UK-specific: No US equivalent is currently available.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/">Apple Wallet</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">How to View Your UK Bank Account Balance and Deposits in Apple Wallet</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-view-your-uk-bank-account-balance-and-deposits-in-apple-wallet.2405247/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week, Apple launched the all-new AirPods Pro 2 with the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case. At the same time, we began tracking the first ever discount on the earbuds, and over the past day or two that &#36;49 markdown is back at Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/AirPods-USB-C-Port-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911675" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the new model of the AirPods Pro 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. Given that the accessory isn't even a week old yet, this is the best deal we've seen so far, and Amazon provides an estimated delivery date of late September/early October.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;199.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset. Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
Our full <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">Deals Roundup</a> has more information on the latest Apple-related sales and bargains.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> This deal has now expired. If the AirPods Pro 2 return to &#36;199.99, we'll be sure to update this article again.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update 2:</strong> The &#36;199.99 sale price briefly reappeared this afternoon, but has once again expired. If you don't see the deal on Amazon, be sure to check back later, as it could return later in the day. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update 3:</strong> As of the morning of September 28, the price continues to fluctuate at Amazon, so keep checking and grab a pair whenever it's dropped to &#36;199.99 if you're interested.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">Apple Deals</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/new-airpods-pro-2-usb-c/">Get the New AirPods Pro 2 With USB-C for &#36;199.99 Thanks to Amazon&#039;s &#36;49 Discount [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/get-the-new-airpods-pro-2-with-usb-c-for-199-99-thanks-to-amazons-49-discount-updated.2405016/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
