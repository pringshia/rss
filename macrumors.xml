		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a handful of Apple accessory discounts on Amazon, including all-time low prices for both the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">Apple Pencil Pro</a> and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">AirTag 4-Pack</a>. Neither deal requires a coupon code this time around, as both have been applied automatically by Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-pencil-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956589" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the Apple Pencil Pro, you can get this accessory for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;99.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00. This is a match for the record low price on the Apple Pencil Pro, and it's a deal that doesn't typically stick around long on Amazon, so if you've been waiting for it to return, be sure to check it out soon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;30 OFF</div>Apple Pencil Pro for &#36;99.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Secondly, Amazon has the AirTag 4-Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;69.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00. This is another best-ever price, and you can find the 1-Pack on sale as well on Amazon, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CWXNS552%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;22.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;29.00.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is exploring both humanoid and non-humanoid robots as future smart home products, according to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. However, he does not expect the robots to launch for several more years, if ever.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Apple-Robot-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961758" /><br/>
Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1889694419907125342">said</a> Apple's robot projects remain in the proof-of-concept stage within the company. In the event that Apple decides to move forward with launching the robots, Kuo believes that mass production likely won't begin until 2028 or later. <br/>
<br/>
Kuo's prediction comes after a team of robotics researchers at Apple designed and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/apple-prototypes-tabletop-robot/">prototyped a lamp-like robot</a> with lifelike movements.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last year reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/">developing a tabletop robot</a> with an "iPad-like display" attached to a "robotic limb." Barring any setbacks, he said Apple was aiming to announce the device as early as 2026 or 2027. As mentioned above, though, Kuo's current prediction for the robots is 2028 or later.<br/>
<br/>
The tabletop robot would be primarily controlled with Siri and Apple Intelligence, according to Gurman. He said the device could respond to commands such as "look at me," which would position the screen on the user's face during a FaceTime video call. The device would also understand different voices, he said.<br/>
<br/>
The tabletop robot could become a higher-end version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/26/homepod-hub-with-7-inch-screen-rumor/">Apple's rumored smart home hub</a>, which is expected to launch this year. Apple is aiming for a price of around &#36;1,000, according to Gurman, but the plans could change.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-robot/">Apple Robot</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/kuo-apple-robots-likely-2028-or-later/">Kuo: Apple Robots Likely to Enter Mass Production in 2028 or Later</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-robots-likely-to-enter-mass-production-in-2028-or-later.2449245/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As the wait continues for Apple's long-rumored, fourth-generation iPhone SE, French electronics retailer Boulanger has prematurely published a <a href="https://www.boulanger.com/ref/1215259">product listing</a> for a "new" model of the iPhone SE. The placeholder page says the device is "coming soon," but it offers no further information, and the price shown is obviously not real.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
The listing was spotted by a reader of the <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1902583-boulanger-annonce-le-nouvel-iphone-se-avant-apple-par-erreur.html">French technology news website <em>Numerama</em></a>. It is unclear if Boulanger has received a heads up from Apple that a new iPhone SE is coming, or if the placeholder page was created in light of rumors.<br/>
<br/>
While the page does not reveal anything specific, it is yet another sign that a new iPhone SE is seemingly coming soon. Unfortunately, it seems like the rumored timeframe has shifted slightly. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/09/gurman-new-iphone-se-this-week/">new iPhone SE was "coming this week,"</a> but he has since said it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/gurman-iphone-se-4-by-next-week/">"should be announced by next week."</a><br/>
<br/>

Whenever the new iPhone SE is finally announced, it is rumored to feature a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, and the first Apple-designed 5G modem. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/iphone-se-4-a18-chip-identifier-leak/">With a rumored A18 chip</a>, along with a rumored 8GB of RAM, the device is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/">expected to support Apple Intelligence</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to schedule an event in 2025, so the new iPhone SE will likely be announced in a press release published on the Apple Newsroom website.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/new-iphone-se-product-listing/">&#039;New&#039; iPhone SE Product Listing Appears on French Website</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-se-product-listing-appears-on-french-website.2449242/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The new Apple Health Study aims to further understand how technology, including the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, can "play a role in advancing and improving physical health, mental health, and overall wellbeing."<br/>
<br/>
The research study will also "explore relationships between various areas of health, such as mental health's impact on heart rate, or how sleep can influence exercise."<br/>
<br/>
This is Apple's most holistic research study yet. It will track how technology impacts many aspects of health and diseases, including activity, aging, cardiovascular health, circulatory health, cognition, hearing, menstrual health, mental health, metabolic health, mobility, neurologic health, respiratory health, sleep, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The all-encompassing Apple Health Study builds upon the Apple Women's Health Study, Apple Hearing Study, and Apple Heart and Movement Study.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is conducting the study in collaboration with Brigham and Women's Hospital, a leading research hospital and Harvard Medical School teaching affiliate.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp is testing a new feature that will allow users to link their social media accounts to their WhatsApp profile, according to findings in the latest iOS beta version of the app (via <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-ios-25-3-10-72-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
Based on the beta's current state, the upcoming feature adds a dedicated section within WhatsApp's Account settings where users can input links to their social media profiles. The beta currently only supports Instagram integration, but other Meta-owned platforms like Facebook and Threads are expected to be included in the official update.<br/>
<br/>
Any social media links are displayed on a user's WhatsApp profile alongside existing information such as their name, phone number, and "About" section. According to the report, WhatsApp will use privacy controls similar to those already available for profile photos, allowing users to manage who can see their linked social media profiles.<br/>
<br/>
Business accounts on WhatsApp can already display social media links after completing an authentication process, so it's likely WhatsApp will introduce similar authentication requirements before the feature's public release, which could arrive in a matter of weeks, if past beta features are anything to go by.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/whatsapp-link-social-media-accounts/">WhatsApp Will Soon Let Users Add Instagram Links to Profiles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-will-soon-let-users-add-instagram-links-to-profiles.2449240/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's designs on its first foldable device appear to have ramped up a notch, with the company said to be tapping suppliers of ultra-thin glass (UTG).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Flip-iPhone-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960021" /><br/>
Chinese manufacturer Lens Technology is set to become Apple's primary supplier of UTG for upcoming foldable devices, according to a new report from <em>The Elec</em> (via <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250212PD209/utg-apple-foldable-supplier-production.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>). The company is expected to secure approximately 70% of Apple's UTG orders, with US-based Corning likely to provide the raw materials.<br/>
<br/>
Lens Technology has reportedly demonstrated significant advantages in mass production capabilities and financial resources for UTG manufacturing. The company is said to be particularly good at glass strengthening and minimizing side cracks after cutting, and also possesses glass etching technology.<br/>
<br/>
The supplier plans to expand its UTG production line in 2025, ahead of Apple's anticipated launch of its first foldable device in the second half of 2026, according to the report. Apple's design approach apparently focuses on thinning only the central part of the UTG, which allows for greater overall thickness and improved durability.<br/>
<br/>
South Korean firms Dowoo Insys and UTI are said to be potential secondary suppliers. Notably, Dowoo Insys secured two patents in October 2024 specifically related to the thinning of UTG's central part, with one patent showing similarities to Apple's own patent from the same period.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung Display could be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-foldable-panels-samsung-display/">exclusive supplier</a> of foldable panels for Apple's first foldable device, which could be a foldable iPhone. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Jeff Pu, <em>The Information</em>, and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> have all targeted late 2026 or early 2027 for a potential launch.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/">The Elec</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/apple-taps-ultra-thin-glass-suppliersfoldable/">Apple Taps Ultra-Thin Glass Suppliers for First Foldable Device</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-taps-ultra-thin-glass-suppliers-for-first-foldable-device.2449239/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google appears to be tackling one of smartphones' most persistent design quirks – the camera bump. According to leaked renders published by <em><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a-renders-colors">Android Headlines</a></em>, the upcoming Pixel 9A will feature an almost flush camera housing, which would be a significant departure from the bumper-sized camera bumps common in modern smartphones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/google-pixel-9a.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989531" /><br/>
The mid-range device's camera module sits nearly level with the phone's chassis, based on side-view renders. That said, the design choice comes with at least one trade-off in camera specifications, as the Pixel 9A will reportedly feature a 48MP main lens, down from the 64MP sensor in its predecessor, the Pixel 8A. The phone will retain a 13MP ultrawide lens and a 13MP front-facing camera, according to the outlet.<br/>
<br/>
Despite housing the camera components further inside the device, which will start at &#36;499, Google has apparently managed to include what could be the largest battery ever in a Pixel phone. The 5,100mAh capacity battery exceeds even that of the premium &#36;1,299 Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, suggesting Google has found innovative ways to utilize the internal space.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Could Future iPhone Camera Bumps Get Smaller?</h2><br/>
The camera bump on iPhones has been a contentious design element since its introduction with the iPhone 6 in 2014. Apple adopted the protrusion to maintain device thinness while accommodating more advanced camera technology, although the design prevented phones from lying flat on surfaces – a complaint that has persisted as camera bumps have grown increasingly prominent.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Google-Pixel-9a-Renders.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989533" /><br/>
However, the trend toward slimmer profiles that is gaining momentum across the industry could see ever smaller camera bumps. Apple is reportedly developing an iPhone 17 Air model that will prioritize thinness over camera capabilities, according to rumors. The device is expected to feature a runway-style horizontal bar across the top of the phone, similar to the design seen on the Google Pixel 9 Pro.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/iphone-17-air-specs-design-everything-we-know/">iPhone 17 Air Design, Specs, and More: All the Rumors So Far</a></li></ul><br/>
To achieve the slimmed down design, the device is expected to have only one camera, as opposed to two or three. It's not clear whether that will reduce the extent to which the camera module protrudes from the case, but the Pixel 9A suggests the smartphone industry's new obsession with thinness could be coming after the camera bump next.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-pixel/">Google Pixel</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/google-pixel-9a-renders-no-camera-bump/">Google&#039;s Next Budget Phone Virtually Eliminates the Camera Bump</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/googles-next-budget-phone-virtually-eliminates-the-camera-bump.2449238/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max has been comprehensively beaten by the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in a real world app speed test conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qNCj8aE6Q">PhoneBuff</a>, with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and 12GB of RAM winning out over the A18 Pro chip and 8GB of RAM in Apple's smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U4qNCj8aE6Q?si=aH7f1yUXjP8LCdY3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The performance test measured how long it took each phone to open and process tasks across a series of apps. Each smartphone cycled through identical apps, including Facebook, Starbucks, Microsoft Office apps, Snapseed, and various games.<br/>
<br/>
The Galaxy S25 Ultra established an early lead through productivity apps and maintained its advantage in image editing tasks, with Snapseed exports completing significantly faster than on the iPhone. Most notably, the Galaxy processed video in LumaFusion approximately 25% faster than the iPhone 16 Pro Max – an area where Apple's smartphones have traditionally excelled.<br/>
<br/>
Even in gaming performance, which historically has been an iPhone strength, Samsung's flagship maintained its edge. The S25 Ultra matched or outperformed the iPhone in most games tested, including Subway Surfers and Flip Diving, but the iPhone did manage slim victories in Going Balls and Forward Assault.<br/>
<br/>
The Galaxy S25 Ultra completed the first lap of app launches in 2 minutes and 18 seconds, a full 15 seconds ahead of the iPhone 16 Pro Max. In the second lap, which tests how well the phones maintain apps in memory, the iPhone managed to reduce the gap slightly, but the Galaxy still secured what PhoneBuff called Samsung's "biggest speed test win in years."<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's impressive performance is likely a consequence of its overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and a 40% larger cooling system, combined with Android 15 and One UI 7 running with an extra 4GB of RAM available. Both devices demonstrate exceptional real-world performance, but the test results suggest Samsung has taken a significant lead in raw processing capability, despite the extra time Apple has had to optimize iOS 18 for its hardware.<br/>
<br/>
Apple typically upgrades iPhones with faster and more efficient chip technology each year, so it will be interesting to see how the iPhone 17 performs when the new series debuts in September. Apple's A19 chip technology is likely to be built on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/iphone-17-unlikely-to-get-2nm-chip/">upgraded 3-nanometer process</a>, which TSMC calls N3P, and the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to include an A19 Pro chip. <br/>
<br/>
Compared to earlier versions of 3nm chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density. All iPhone 17 models will also reportedly include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/iphone-17-major-thermal-upgrade/">vapor chamber heatsink</a> to improve thermal performance.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/iphone-16-pro-max-beaten-s25-ultra-speed-test/">iPhone 16 Pro Max Beaten by Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in App Loading Speed Test</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-max-beaten-by-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-in-app-loading-speed-test.2449234/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Exact timing for the debut of the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> remains up in the air, with <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1889504630507446454">reporting in a tweet tonight</a> that the device "should be announced by next week." Last week, Gurman indicated that it could arrive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/iphone-se-4-launch-next-week/">as early as this week</a> and later claimed that it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/09/gurman-new-iphone-se-this-week/">arriving this week</a>, but there once again appears to be some uncertainty about the timing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-SE-4-Single-Camera-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978494" /><br/>
Interestingly, Gurman now says that Apple has a few other imminent announcements up its sleeve, including a "smaller announcement" planned for tomorrow. Apple's PR representatives for Vision Pro are also "reaching out to press about an announcement to come."<blockquote>New iPhone SE is still imminent and should be announced by next week, when the company is holding product briefings. Tomorrow there's a smaller announcement. For Friday, Apple Vision Pro reps are reaching out to press about an announcement to come. M4 MacBook Air within weeks.</blockquote><br/>
The M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> is expected to be introduced "within weeks," according to Gurman, though timing remains unclear as a launch has been thought to be imminent for a while now and was originally rumored to be planned as Apple's first hardware launch of the year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[If you have two Apple Accounts with multiple digital purchases between them, Apple now has a way for you to consolidate the accounts by migrating content from one account to another.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Sqaure-Complement.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833993" /><br/>
As noted by Stephen Hackett of <em><a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/02/apple-launches-tool-to-migrate-purchases-between-apple-accounts/">512 Pixels</a></em>, Apple today <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117294">published a support document</a> that provides instructions for moving purchases from a secondary Apple Account to a primary Apple Account.<br/>
<br/>
Apps, music, books, TV shows, and movies that have been purchased on a secondary account can be migrated to a main account, which is useful for people who have separate accounts for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> and for making media purchases.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that to migrate purchases, the primary email address, phone number, password for both accounts is required, neither account should be shared, and two-factor authentication must be turned on. When the migration takes place, the Apple Account that's signed in for use with &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; will be the primary Apple Account, and the Apple Account signed in for Media and Purchases will be the secondary Apple Account.<br/>
<br/>
To go through the process, you'll need to sign in with two different accounts on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, one for &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; and one for purchases. There are several steps to go through, such as making sure that both accounts are set to the same country, and ensuring the secondary account does not have a remaining balance.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in merging accounts, you should <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117294">go through the checklist</a> that Apple has outlined, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117267">read through Apple's info</a> on what happens during an account migration and how to undo it. <br/>
<br/>
The actual merging process can be done by opening up the Settings app, going to Media and Purchases, tapping View Account, and then choosing the Migrate Purchases option. After migration, the secondary account can no longer be used for purchases, and you will need to sign in with the primary account on all Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
When combining accounts, all payment methods associated with the secondary account will migrate to the primary Apple Account, and subscriptions will also transfer over. The secondary account's Up Next queue in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> will also migrate over and replace content from the primary account, as will any podcast library data.<br/>
<br/>
Migrating Apple Account purchases is not available in the European Union, United Kingdom, or India at the current time.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-migrate-purchases-apple-account/">Apple Now Lets You Move Digital Purchases From One Apple Account to Another</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-lets-you-move-digital-purchases-from-one-apple-account-to-another.2449217/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ColorWare today launched a new line of <a href="https://www.colorware.com/collections/colorware-airpods-blended">custom-painted AirPods</a>, offering the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> in various shades of brown. The new shades are meant to be neutral, standing out less than white AirPods when the earbuds are in the ears. <br/>
<br/>

There are three colors available for each product, including a light, cream colored "Glaze" shade, a mid-toned brown called "Toasty," and "Java," a darker brown color. The colors are reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/kim-kardashian-beats-studio-pro/">neutral color options</a> Apple has introduced for its Beats line in partnership with Kim Kardashian.<br/>
<br/>
ColorWare is known for custom painting Apple devices, and has been making electronics in custom colors for more than a decade. The company offers tons of other colors for the AirPods, employing a proprietary painting method that ensures longevity for the added paint.<br/>
<br/>

Custom AirPods come with a premium price. The Blended &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are &#36;849, the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 are &#36;439, and the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; are &#36;329 for the standard version and &#36;379 for the ANC model. Other than the custom color, the AirPods are unchanged so performance and feature set remains the same as standard AirPods from Apple.<br/>

ColorWare <a href="https://www.colorware.com/collections/mac-mini-light-retro">also recently came out</a> with custom "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> Retro" colors, featuring a rainbow Apple logo. The light version is the same cream color that Apple used for classic Macs, while the black version is a classic, matte black. Pricing starts at &#36;899.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/colorware-blended-custom-airpods/">ColorWare Launches New &#039;Blended&#039; Custom AirPods Colors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/colorware-launches-new-blended-custom-airpods-colors.2449215/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is in the process of renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and changes are already being made to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> app. When searching in the Maps app for Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico name is shown or the name is blank, but tapping into the area shows the "Gulf of America" wording.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-maps-gulf-of-america.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989494" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/apple-is-renaming-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america-on-maps-app">Bloomberg</a></em>, Apple is rolling out the Maps change in the United States today, so the name should shift for most U.S. users in the near future. Apple plans to change the name for all users globally in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/united-states-geographic-name-change-feb-2025/">this week</a> also made good on its promise to adopt the new naming, and "Gulf of America" is now visible in both Google Maps and Waze.<br/>
<br/>
Google and Apple use data from the U.S. Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) when naming world locations, and GNIS updated its database with the "Gulf of America" name change this week.<br/>
<br/>
Google has explained that Maps users in the United States will see "Gulf of America" instead of "Gulf of Mexico," while users in Mexico will continue to see Gulf of Mexico. In the rest of the world, the name for the body of water between Mexico and Florida will continue to be named Gulf of Mexico, but Gulf of America is shown in parentheses below. Apple might adopt similar changes outside of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
When U.S. President Donald Trump took office on January 20, one of his first orders was changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Other countries do not refer to the area as the Gulf of America and are not required to accept the U.S. name.<br/>
<br/>
Trump also said that Alaskan mountain Denali was being renamed to Mt. McKinley, but Google Maps and &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; have not yet made that change.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-maps-gulf-of-america/">Apple Adopting &#039;Gulf of America&#039; Naming for Apple Maps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adopting-gulf-of-america-naming-for-apple-maps.2449214/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-announced/">upcoming Powerbeats Pro 2</a> will have a day one firmware update available, as Apple has just released new software for the earbuds. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2 will ship with 7B15 firmware, and the new firmware has a 7B24 version number.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/powerbeats-pro-2-2.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989293" /><br/>
There's no word on what's included in the new firmware, but the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 have heart rate monitoring functionality that's never before been included in Apple earbuds. The &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 have built-in optical LED sensors that measure heart rate through blood flow in the ears.<br/>
<br/>
Along with heart rate monitoring, the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 include Active Noise Cancellation, Personalized Spatial Audio, Apple's H2 chip for connectivity, and improved sound thanks to a redesigned acoustic architecture.<br/>
<br/>
As for design, the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 have an earhook that's 50 percent smaller than the earhook from the original Powerbeats, more ear tip sizes, 20 percent lighter weight, and a slimmed down case with better battery life.<br/>
<br/>
The updated firmware can be installed on the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 by connecting them to power and ensuring that they are in Bluetooth range of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi. Firmware can be checked on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by going to Settings > Bluetooth and tapping the Info button next to the Beats headphones in the list. Android users can download new Beats firmware through the Beats app for Android.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 can be <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX723LL/A/powerbeats-pro-2-high-performance-earbuds-jet-black">ordered from Apple's website</a> starting today, and they are set to launch on Thursday, February 13.

		<description><![CDATA[Pixelmator <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/apple-acquires-pixelmator/">last year announced</a> that it was being acquired by Apple, and today the company confirmed that the acquisition has been completed after Apple received regulatory approval. The Pixelmator for iOS, Pixelmator Pro, and Photomator apps were today updated with a new splash screen announcing the deal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/pixelmator-pro-apple-acquisition-complete.jpg" alt="" width="2843" height="1599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989480" /><br/>
Pixelmator is a well-known image and photo editing app that competes with Photoshop and other Adobe image editing tools, while focusing on ease of use and performance. The apps are exclusive to Apple's platforms.<br/>
<br/>
No changes to the Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, or Photomator apps have been made at this time. Apple could eventually integrate these apps into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, but for now they remain separate and available from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has photo editing tools available in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac, but the company used to maintain a separate photo editing app called Aperture. Aperture was discontinued in 2015, and the app was removed from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/">Mac App Store</a> at that time.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pixelmator/">Pixelmator</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-completes-pixelmator-acquisition/">Apple Completes Pixelmator Acquisition</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-completes-pixelmator-acquisition.2449195/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's supply chain is gearing up for the upcoming launch of new iPad Air, MacBook Air, and entry-level iPad models, according <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250210PD229.html">to <em>DigiTimes</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ipad-air-gradient.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967393" /><br/>
Apple's supply chain began shipments of the new devices in December, according to the report. The new iPad Air, MacBook Air, and entry-level iPad models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/ipad-air-macbook-air-stocks-running-low-apple/">are "coming soon,"</a> according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, but it is unclear exactly when. Gurman said a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/09/gurman-new-iphone-se-this-week/">new iPhone SE will be announced this week</a>, and the new Mac and iPad models should follow by March or April at the absolute latest, but perhaps much sooner.<br/>
<br/>
In a paywalled report today, the Taiwanese supply chain publication vaguely said that the new devices will be "transitioning to Apple's own chips." Given that Macs and iPads already use Apple-designed processors, the report could be referring to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">Apple's rumored Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a>. However, Gurman previously reported that the chip would come to Macs and iPads "by 2026," so the exact timing of this shift remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said Apple's planned Wi-Fi chip supports Wi-Fi 6E, but it is unclear if it would have any consumer benefits compared to existing Wi-Fi chips in Apple devices, supplied by Broadcom. One benefit of Apple's chip could be power efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
The new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models are expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/m4-macbook-air-chip-identifiers/">equipped with the M4 chip</a>, while the iPad Air is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/20/new-ipad-air-models-with-m3-chip-leak/">rumored to get the M3 chip</a> and the iPad 11 is said to gain <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/ipad-11-with-a16-chip-identifier-leak/">either the A16 chip or A17 Pro chip</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[After months of teasers and leaks, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-announced/">Powerbeats Pro 2 were finally announced</a> by Apple today. A key new feature built into the Powerbeats Pro 2 is heart rate monitoring, and that functionality is expected to expand to AirPods in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/AirPods-Pro-3-Heart-Rate-Tracking-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-983628" /><br/>
When both Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds are placed in the ears, and heart rate monitoring is active, Apple says LED optical sensors pulse at over 100 times per second to measure heart rate via blood flow. The feature integrates with popular fitness apps to collect data during workouts and sync it to the Apple Health app on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
The feature is based on the Apple Watch's heart rate sensing technology. If someone is wearing both Powerbeats Pro 2 and an Apple Watch, Apple says apps will default to using Apple Watch heart rate data, and it will likely be the same for future AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
In his coverage of the Powerbeats Pro 2 announcement today, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/apple-s-beats-launches-250-powerbeats-pro-2-with-heart-rate-monitoring"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reiterated</a> that new AirPods with heart rate monitoring are "still many months away" from launching. The feature is likely to be available on the AirPods Pro 3, which are currently expected to launch in late 2025 at the earliest.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/airpods-with-heart-rate-monitoring-months-away/">New AirPods With Powerbeats Pro 2&#039;s Heart Rate Monitoring Feature Still &#039;Months Away&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-airpods-with-powerbeats-pro-2s-heart-rate-monitoring-feature-still-months-away.2449189/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

RR Auction says the business card is from around 1983, and it lists Jobs as Chairman of Apple's Board of Directors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Steve-Jobs-Business-Card-Feature-6-Colors.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989445" /><br/>
The business card has been authenticated by well-known memorabilia grading service PSA, which rated it a "Gem Mint 10," aka a "virtually perfect card."<br/>
<br/>
The next bid is already set at nearly &#36;50,000, but note that a similar Jobs-signed business card sold for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/steve-jobs-signed-business-card-auction/">just over &#36;181,000 at auction</a> last year.<br/>
<br/>
Jobs passed away in 2011 at the age of 56. Throughout his career, he was reluctant to sign autographs, so items with his signature on them often sell for large sums of money. In 2023, for example, a check signed by Jobs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/11/steve-jobs-check-100k-auction/">sold for over &#36;100,000 at auction</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/steve-jobs/">Steve Jobs</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/steve-jobs-signed-business-card-auction-2/">Got &#36;50,000?
