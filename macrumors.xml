		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week made the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-ios-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">first betas of iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5</a> available to developers for testing. The upcoming software updates include only a few new user-facing features so far, but hidden code changes reveal some additional possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943813" /><br/>
Below, we have recapped everything new in the first iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 betas so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Web Distribution</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-ios-app-store-safari-changes.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933983" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 17.5, iPhone users in the EU will be able to download iOS apps directly from the websites of select developers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">previously announced</a> that "Web Distribution" would be available starting "later this spring" with an upcoming software update for the iPhone, and the first beta of iOS 17.5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/ios-17-5-app-website-downloads-eu/">includes newly-added code to support the feature</a>.<br/>
<br/>
"Web Distribution" will be limited to larger developers based in the EU. To qualify for this distribution method, Apple says the developer must be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more, and have an app that had more than one million annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
"Web Distribution" builds upon the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">alternative app marketplaces</a> that Apple already allows on the iPhone in the EU starting with iOS 17.4. Apple has made these app-related changes to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Color-Changing Apple Podcasts Widget</h2><br/>
While listening to a podcast on the iOS 17.5 beta, the background color of the Apple Podcasts widget changes to match the podcast's cover art. This feature was first added in the iOS 17.4 beta, but it was removed before that update was released.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Color-changing Apple Podcasts widget is back in iOS 17.5! <a href="https://t.co/2PonD5FMi6">pic.twitter.com/2PonD5FMi6</a></p>&mdash; Stephen Robles (@stephenrobles) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenrobles/status/1775223262751977723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<h2>Mobile Device Management</h2><br/>
<br/>
As noted <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1775273274039259349">by Aaron Perris</a>, MDM solutions can enforce an iOS beta version during Automated Device Enrollment starting with the iOS 17.5 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Code Changes</h2><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Battery Health Menu for Future iPads</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPad-Battery-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1990" height="1120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944716" /><br/>
The first iPadOS 17.5 beta includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/">several new references to a Battery Health menu on the iPad</a>, but the feature is not actually visible yet. The menu is expected to show an iPad battery's maximum remaining capacity and cycle count.<br/>
<br/>
A sample of the code strings added in the iPadOS 17.5 beta:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>"iPad must be regularly used while not connected to power to show maximum capacity."</li><br/>
<li>"This is the number of times iPad has used your battery's capacity."</li><br/>
<li>"The iPad battery is performing as expected."</li><br/>
<li>"iPad batteries, like all rechargeable batteries, have a limited lifespan and may eventually need to be serviced or replaced."</li><br/>
<li>"The original battery was designed to retain X capacity at X cycles under ideal conditions. Actual battery performance depends on a number of variables, including how iPad is used and charged regularly. The one-year warranty includes service for defective batteries in addition to rights provided under local consumer laws."</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
There is no visible Battery Health menu on any existing iPad models on the first iPadOS 17.5 beta, leading us to believe that the menu may be limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">new iPad Pro and iPad Air models that are rumored to launch in May</a>, and likely other new iPads released in the future. Apple has shown battery capacity information on iPhones for many years, but cycle count information is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-shows-battery-cycle-count/">limited to the latest iPhone 15 series</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New Apple Pencil</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-pencil.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939786" /><br/>
The first beta of iOS 17.5 potentially references a new fourth-generation Apple Pencil, amid rumors that the accessory will be updated soon.<br/>
<br/>
The beta includes a hidden code reference to a "V4" version of the Apple Pencil:<blockquote>NumberOfApplePencilV1ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV2ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV3ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV4ConnectionsCount</blockquote>A new Apple Pencil is rumored to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">alongside updated iPad Pro and iPad Air models in May</a>. Apple refers to the USB-C version of the Apple Pencil released last year as the third-generation Apple Pencil in iOS code, so the fourth-generation model would be a new version that would likely succeed the second-generation Apple Pencil.<br/>
<br/>
Additional code in the iOS 17.5 beta suggests that the Apple Pencil could gain a "squeeze" gesture for certain actions, but details are slim.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Third-Party Item Tracker Alerts</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/AirTag-and-iPhone-Notification-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1082" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894205" /><br/>
Apple and Google last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/apple-to-expand-unwanted-tracking-alerts/">jointly announced</a> a proposed industry specification to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth item trackers for unwanted tracking of individuals. As part of this initiative, Apple promised to expand AirTag-like "Found Moving With You" alerts to third-party item trackers in a future software update, which may be iOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
The first iOS 17.5 beta adds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-third-party-item-tracker-alerts/">references to alerts for third-party item trackers</a>. For example: "You can disable this item and stop it from sharing its location with the owner. To do this, follow the instructions provided on a website by the manufacturer of this item."<br/>
<br/>
Tile, Chipolo, Samsung, Eufy, and Pebblebee all expressed support for the industry specification, according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-google-partner-on-an-industry-specification-to-address-unwanted-tracking/">Apple's announcement</a> last year.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Block All Participants in Group FaceTime Calls</h3><br/>
iOS 17.5 beta code indicates that there may be a new "Block All Participants" option for group FaceTime calls, which could help users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/group-facetime-spam-calls/">fight spam</a>. We have not confirmed if the feature is functional yet in the first beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2><br/>
iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 will likely be released to the public in May.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is exploring various "personal robotics" projects in an effort to create its "next big thing," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/apple-explores-home-robots-after-abandoning-car-efforts"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Amazon-Astro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944747" /><em>Amazon's Astro robot</em></div><br/>
One of these projects is described as a "mobile robot" that would "follow users around their homes," while another is said to be an "advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around":<blockquote>Engineers at Apple have been exploring a mobile robot that can follow users around their homes, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the skunk-works project is private. The iPhone maker also has developed an advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around, they said.</blockquote>Apple is investigating the use of AI algorithms that would help robots "navigate cluttered spaces within people's homes," the report says. Apple has apparently wanted to create robots that can "handle chores, like cleaning dishes in a sink," but Gurman said this feat is unlikely this decade due to "extraordinarily difficult engineering challenges."<br/>
<br/>
Apple's home robot could compete with the likes of Amazon's Astro, which serves as a mobile virtual assistant and provides home security monitoring.<br/>
<br/>
As for the table-top device, Gurman said one idea was for its display to "mimic the head movements" of a person on a FaceTime video call. However, he said Apple has faced technical challenges related to "balancing the weight of a robotic motor on a small stand," and some Apple executives have apparently debated whether to develop such a device.<br/>
<br/>
The robotics projects are said to be in the very early stages of research, and it is unclear if any of them will ever be released to the public. For now, these are just moonshot ideas, but they are fascinating ones to learn about.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/apple-reportedly-investigating-robotics/">Apple Exploring &#039;Mobile Robot&#039; That &#039;Follows Users Around Their Homes&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-exploring-mobile-robot-that-follows-users-around-their-homes.2423460/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple may be planning to expand the iPhone's Battery Health menu to upcoming iPad models, based on evidence uncovered in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-ios-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">iPadOS 17.5 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPad-Battery-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1990" height="1120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944716" /><br/>
As discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/steve-moser/">Steve Moser</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a>, there are several new references to a Battery Health menu on the iPad within the code for the first iPadOS 17.5 beta, which was released to developers earlier this week. The menu is expected to show an iPad battery's maximum remaining capacity and cycle count.<br/>
<br/>
A sample of the code strings added in the iPadOS 17.5 beta:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>"iPad must be regularly used while not connected to power to show maximum capacity."</li><br/>
<li>"This is the number of times iPad has used your battery's capacity."</li><br/>
<li>"The iPad battery is performing as expected."</li><br/>
<li>"iPad batteries, like all rechargeable batteries, have a limited lifespan and may eventually need to be serviced or replaced."</li><br/>
<li>"The original battery was designed to retain X capacity at X cycles under ideal conditions. Actual battery performance depends on a number of variables, including how iPad is used and charged regularly. The one-year warranty includes service for defective batteries in addition to rights provided under local consumer laws."</li></ul><br/>
<br/>

Apple has shown battery capacity information on iPhones for many years, but cycle count information is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-shows-battery-cycle-count/">limited to the latest iPhone 15 series</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will likely release iPadOS 17.5 to the public in May. Given this is a code finding in a beta, we cannot guarantee that a Battery Health menu will be added to the iPad, but it is certainly something that Apple has been working on.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/">iPadOS 17.5 Beta Hints at Battery Capacity and Cycle Count Menu on Upcoming iPads</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-17-5-beta-hints-at-battery-capacity-and-cycle-count-menu-on-upcoming-ipads.2423459/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As of this week, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> users can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/spatial-personas-beta-coming-to-vision-pro/">set up a spatial Persona</a>, which is a new version of a Persona that's designed to make it feel like you're interfacing with other people right in the same room. We thought we'd test out the spatial Persona feature to see how it works and whether it's an improvement over the regular Persona option.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZN1ADgbgDMY?si=uoXk3TI6iDhYmwo7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Spatial Personas have a translucent background and include the head, hands, and top part of the torso to provide a more natural feel so that it seems like the people in the conversation are in the same physical room with one another. With spatial Personas, people can move about in their real world space, and that's reflected in the virtual setting. Persona location is the same for all people on a call, so if there are five participants, each one has a different location just as they would sitting together in a room.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at or point to someone on the call, the other participants can see where you are looking or pointing. Voices are also directional relative to where each person is at.<br/>
<br/>
Standard Personas show only a person's face and are limited to a small tile, but spatial Personas have a much more immersive feel. Apple has been improving Personas since the Vision Pro headset launched, and while there's still an uncanny valley feel to them, the visuals are much improved and overall less creepy.<br/>
<br/>
Spatial Personas can be used for watching movies and TV shows together, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> and other video calls, using apps like Freeform, playing games, and more.<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, spatial Personas are live in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> in a beta capacity, with the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 update required. Spatial Personas work with up to five participants.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/testing-vision-pro-spatial-persona/">Testing the New Apple Vision Pro Spatial Persona</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-the-new-apple-vision-pro-spatial-persona.2423452/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-ios-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">first beta of iOS 17.5</a> potentially references a new fourth-generation Apple Pencil, amid rumors that the accessory will be updated soon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-pencil.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939786" /><br/>
The beta includes a hidden code reference to a "V4" version of the Apple Pencil, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/steve-moser/">Steve Moser</a>:<blockquote>NumberOfApplePencilV1ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV2ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV3ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV4ConnectionsCount</blockquote>A new Apple Pencil is rumored to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">alongside updated iPad Pro and iPad Air models in May</a>. Apple refers to the USB-C version of the Apple Pencil released last year as the third-generation Apple Pencil in iOS code, so the fourth-generation model would be a new version that would likely succeed the second-generation Apple Pencil.<br/>
<br/>
Additional code in the iOS 17.5 beta uncovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a> suggests that the Apple Pencil could gain a "squeeze" gesture for certain actions, but details are slim. The gesture may provide users with a quicker way to add a sticker, text box, signature, or shape in image editing apps, the code suggests.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> exclusively reported that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-pencil-visionon-support-in-testing/">tested a new Apple Pencil with visionOS support</a>, but it is unclear if this feature will be released to the public.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">iPadOS 17.5 Beta Potentially References New Apple Pencil and &#039;Squeeze&#039; Gesture</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-17-5-beta-potentially-references-new-apple-pencil-and-squeeze-gesture.2423447/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple launched the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> 14 years ago today, starting a product line that has gone on to define the tablet space and entry-level computing, spur a shift in how media is consumed, and have immense cultural impact.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/steve-jobs-ipad-2010.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-780535" /><br/>
The original &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; launched on April 3, 2010. Designed to bridge the gap between the laptop and the smartphone, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; offered a unique combination of portability, ease of use, and versatility that appealed to a wide range of consumers and professionals.<br/>
<br/>
At the heart of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s success was its sleek design and simple iOS user interface. The 9.7-inch touchscreen provided users with an immersive experience that was unmatched at the time. Its initial release boasted 16 to 64 gigabytes of storage, a 30-pin connector, Wi-Fi connectivity, and, on some models, 3G connectivity. This combination of features and the quality of its build set it apart from competitors, establishing the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as a premium option in the emerging tablet market.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; catalyzed a shift in the software industry, leading to the development of apps designed specifically for its larger screen, which increasingly differed from the smartphone applications of the time. This app ecosystem rapidly expanded, with developers creating a wide range of applications from productivity tools and games to educational software. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; went on to be vital to the education market and many mobile workflows.<br/>
<br/>
The lineup has since expanded to include new models like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. The introduction of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-keyboard/">Smart Keyboard</a> further transformed the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; from a simple media consumption device to a tool designed for creativity and productivity. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the operating system behind the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, is also based on iPadOS to a large extent.<br/>
<br/>
Today, it has been <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com">almost 18 months</a> since any new iPads have launched – the longest-ever wait for new models. 2023 was the only year since the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s introduction <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/01/apple-just-broke-a-tradition-it-held-for-12-years/">with no new iPad models</a>. Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">now expected</a> to release refreshed &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models in May, with updates to the entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; tabled for later in the year. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipad-launched-14-years-ago/">The iPad Launched 14 Years Ago Today as Longest-Ever Wait for New Models Continues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-ipad-launched-14-years-ago-today-as-longest-ever-wait-for-new-models-continues.2423442/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

This is a match of the record low price on the tablet, and it's available in all colors except Starlight, with delivery as soon as this Friday, April 5.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPad-Air-150-Off-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1304" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933761" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The last time we tracked this deal it was at Best Buy, but right now Amazon is beating Best Buy's deal on the same tablet by about &#36;50. There are quite a few <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3L141V%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">&#36;100 markdowns on other fifth generation M1 iPad Air models</a>, but none are matching all-time low prices like the 64GB Wi-Fi model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HN1KC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;150 OFF</div>iPad Air (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;449.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Like other iPads, the M1 iPad Air is getting up there in age, having launched back in March 2022. Because of the imminent launch of new models, we're starting to see more consistent discounts on the 2022 tablets, which are still solid options for anyone who doesn't care about waiting for the new sixth generation devices.<br/>

Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/">is now &#36;1,000,000</a>, up from a previous limit of &#36;250,000.<br/>
<br/>
When the account first became available, Apple and Goldman Sachs offered an APY of 4.15%. The rate then increased three times, first to 4.25%, then to 4.35%, and finally to 4.5%. The drop to 4.4% is the first time the rate has gone down.<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs reportedly plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">end its consumer lending partnership with Apple</a>, but it is unclear if this will have any impact on Apple Card holders.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/apple-card-savings-rate-comparison-april/">Apple Card Savings Account&#039;s Interest Rate Lowered to 4.4% Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-accounts-interest-rate-lowered-to-4-4-today.2423294/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Major Earthquake in Taiwan Halts Some Apple Chip Production Lines</title>

		<description><![CDATA[A major earthquake in Taiwan has halted some TSMC chip production lines, potentially impacting the manufacture of Apple devices (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/tsmc-evacuates-production-lines-after-major-taiwan-quake">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
A 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck Taiwan in the early hours of the morning, killing at least nine people, injuring hundreds, and causing significant damage to infrastructure, including disrupting operations at several TSMC key manufacturing sites. Sources familiar with TSMC's operations said that the company's N3 fab in Tainan suffered structural damage, with beams and columns broken, leading to an outright halt in production. EUV machines, essential for manufacturing processes below 7nm, have stopped, and research and development labs have been subject to significant damage, such as cracked walls. Another fab in Hsinchu reported broken pipelines and extensive damage to wafers, necessitating a halt in production.<br/>
<br/>
Some of TSMC's high-end chips, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> A17 Pro in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, require round-the-clock operations and a stable vacuum environment for several weeks. As a result, some high-end chips already in production are likely to have been spoiled even if they were not damaged directly. <br/>
<br/>
All of the custom silicon processors in Apple's devices are supplied by TSMC. As such, the earthquake's immediate effects on TSMC's facilities have raised concerns about potential delays in Apple's product supply chain. The chipmaker has taken immediate action to assess the damage and initiate recovery procedures, with some production lines expected to resume operation today, but the full extent of the impact on Apple's supply chain remains uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC has historically placed a strong emphasis on disaster preparedness, especially following a major earthquake in 1999. The company has since implemented rigorous seismic management measures designed to mitigate the risks posed by earthquakes, including post-earthquake inspections, the installation of dampers and shock absorbers, and the integration of equipment vibration reduction technologies.<br/>

Apple is in the midst of ramping up production for its upcoming product releases, so significant disruptions in the supply of TSMC-manufactured chips could potentially delay product launches or limit availability. That being said, Apple is known for its robust supply chain management strategies, which will likely help mitigate the immediate effects of the earthquake on the company's product timelines and availability.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/taiwan/">Taiwan</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/major-earthquake-in-taiwan/">Major Earthquake in Taiwan Halts Some Apple Chip Production Lines</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/major-earthquake-in-taiwan-halts-some-apple-chip-production-lines.2423436/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Philips Hue app was today updated to version 5.14, adding support for widgets. Hue widgets can be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, Lock Screen, or Today View, and can be used for controlling lights and other accessories.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/philips-hue-app-widget.jpg" alt="" width="3084" height="1735" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944563" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> come in small, medium, and large sizes with the largest widget supporting eight actions or scenes. &zwnj;Widgets&zwnj; can be tailored to the entire Hue bridge or to lights that are located in specific rooms, so you can set up a widget for each of your rooms if desired.<br/>
<br/>
Each of the actions can be customized, and you can choose a scene from the Hue app or opt to turn lights in certain rooms on or off. Dimming lights is not an option, nor is activating automations, but some of that can be done through scenes. Adding a widget is a useful way to control frequently accessed lights or scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Along with widgets, the update also improves Friends of Hue switches like the Lutron Aurora Smart Bulb Dimmer Switch. Switches now support time-based light, the scene cycle mode, the natural light scene, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The Philips Hue app can be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/philips-hue/id1055281310">downloaded from the App Store</a> for free. It is designed to work with <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us">Philips Hue lights</a> and accessories.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/">Philips Hue</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/philips-hue-app-widgets/">Philips Hue App Gains Support for Widgets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-app-gains-support-for-widgets.2423410/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to release a new version of the Beats Solo 4 headphones, and hints of the refresh have been seen in both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-working-on-beats-solo-4-headphones/">iOS updates</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-beats-solo-4-headphones/">FCC filings</a> in recent weeks. We've already seen the design and some of the features, with rumors pointing to support for Spatial Audio, but the headphones' full specs were today shared by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/02/beats-solo4-specs/">9to5Mac</a></em> ahead of launch.<br/>

 	<li>3.5mm port will still be available for lossless audio.</li><br/>
 	<li>50 hours of playback time, up 10 hours from the Beats Solo 3.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced a new firmware update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A325, up from the 6A324 firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-releases-6a324-firmware-for-airpods-max/">released in January</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new, and the notes often only list generic bug fixes. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade the software on the AirPods, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are powered on and connected to an iOS device or a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ Max‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌AirPods to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first beta of iOS 17.5 to developers, and as expected, the update introduces support for downloading apps from developer websites in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-933094" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" /><br/>
In iOS 17.4, Apple began allowing developers to offer their apps through alternative app marketplaces in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act. Apple initially intended for apps to only be available through these marketplaces, but in March, Apple said that it would in fact be adding support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">downloading apps directly from websites</a>.<br/>
<br/>
To offer an app for download from a website in the European Union, developers need to meet specific criteria. Developers need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and must have an app with more than one million first installs on iOS in the European Union in the prior year. Other requirements include submitting to Apple's notarization process and publishing transparent data collection policies.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will provide authorized developers with an API that allows them to offer their apps for download via the web. Apps downloaded this way will be able to be backed up, restored, updated, and more.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time that Apple has sanctioned downloading an app directly from a website. Support for this feature will allow apps like Spotify, Fortnite, and others to be downloaded directly on iPhones should the developers behind those apps opt in to Apple's terms.<br/>
<br/>
Apps offered through the web do not have to pay any commission to Apple, but they are subject to the 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee.<br/>
<br/>
As with alternative app marketplaces, app downloads from the web are available in the European Union only under the terms of the DMA. Note that apps can only be downloaded this way on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as the changes do not apply to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/ios-17-5-app-website-downloads-eu/">iOS 17.5 Lets EU iPhone Users Download Apps From Websites</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-5-lets-eu-iphone-users-download-apps-from-websites.2423395/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.5 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a month after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-tvos-17-4/">release of tvOS 17.4</a>.<br/>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.5 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-tvos-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Beta of tvOS 17.5 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-tvos-17-5-to-developers.2423391/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
