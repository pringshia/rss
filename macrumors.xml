		<description><![CDATA[macOS Sonoma better optimizes the long-term battery health of the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip, according to Apple's release notes for the software update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macbook-air-spacegray-purple-battery.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913843" /><br/>
"Battery health management updated on 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip to better optimize long term battery health," the release notes state.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not provide any additional details about the exact optimizations that it made, nor have there been any widespread battery health complaints from customers who own this 13-inch MacBook Air model, released in July 2022. Battery health information can be found by opening the System Settings app and clicking on Battery.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211832">support document</a>, Apple explains how the battery health management feature works:<blockquote>Battery health management is designed to improve your battery's lifespan by reducing the rate at which it chemically ages. The feature does this by monitoring your battery's temperature history and its charging patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the measurements that it collects, battery health management may temporarily reduce your battery's maximum charge. This happens as needed to ensure that your battery charges to a level that's optimized for your usage—reducing wear on the battery, and slowing its chemical aging.</blockquote>macOS Sonoma is set to be released today following over three months of beta testing, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/24/macos-sonoma-launch-date-and-features/">key new features</a> including interactive desktop widgets, a Game Mode, the ability to add websites to the Dock as web apps, several Safari improvements, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[EU industry chief Thierry Breton today publicly called on Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> to open the company's ecosystem of hardware and software to rivals (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-breton-tells-apple-ceo-open-its-ecosystem-rivals-2023-09-26/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
Following an in-person meeting with Cook earlier today in Brussels, Belgium, Breton told <em>Reuters</em>:<blockquote>The next job for Apple and other Big Tech, under the DMA (Digital Markets Act) is to open up its gates to competitors. Be it the electronic wallet, browsers or app stores, consumers using an Apple iPhone should be able to benefit from competitive services by a range of providers.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The EU's Digital Markets Act seeks to curtail the power of major tech companies. Designated "gatekeeper" platforms will now face prohibition against favoring their own services over those of rivals. Earlier this month, Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Safari, and iOS were officially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">classified as gatekeepers</a>. Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/">expected to add support</a> for sideloading apps from outside the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; on iPhones and iPads in Europe via an update to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> due to the DMA's requirements.<br/>
<br/>
Breton went on to be critical of Apple's argument that security and privacy are the reasons it protects its closed ecosystem. "EU regulation fosters innovation, without compromising on security and privacy," Breton added. After the discussion, Cook today visited a local Apple retail store in Brussels:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great to connect with team members and customers at Apple Brussels! <a href="https://t.co/RYW2NOGiM9">pic.twitter.com/RYW2NOGiM9</a></p>&mdash; Tim Cook (@tim_cook) <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1706609678522658865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple apparently declined to respond to Breton's latest remarks.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/eu-calls-on-apple-to-open-ecosystem/">EU Chief Calls on Apple CEO Tim Cook to Open Hardware and Software Ecosystem</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-chief-calls-on-apple-ceo-tim-cook-to-open-hardware-and-software-ecosystem.2404803/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last week launched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, the latest major software update for compatible Apple Watch models, as well as the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and second-generation Apple Watch Ultra, both of which come with &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; pre-installed. Headline &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; features include a new Smart Stack interface with widgets, new watch faces, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/22-Hidden-Features-in-watchOS-10-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2248" height="1264" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913396" /><br/>
In this article, we've listed 22 other features and enhancements in Apple's new smartwatch software, many of which may have gone under your radar. Bear in mind that ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; requires Apple Watch Series 4 or later and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> XS or later running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="1._automate_night_mode">1. Automate Night Mode</h2><br/>
On Apple Watch Ultra models, &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; brings a new Modular Ultra watch face that, like the Wayfinder face, supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/">Night Mode</a>. &zwnj;Night Mode&zwnj; puts a red filter on the display, and previously could only be manually activated by turning the Digital Crown. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/1-auto-night-mode.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912577" /><br/>
In &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, however, there's a &zwnj;Night Mode&zwnj; setting in the watch face edit screen for these two watch faces that lets you set it to Auto or On/Off. On the Auto setting, &zwnj;Night Mode&zwnj; will automatically activate in poor lighting conditions, such as when your sleeve is covering your watch or when you look at it in a dark room. Note that turning the Digital Crown no longer works, as this action now brings up the new Widget Stack. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2._check_control_center_status">2. Check Control Center Status</h2><br/>
Small icons at the top of Control Center indicate the status of certain settings — for example, that your Apple Watch is connected to cellular, your location is being used by an app, and features like Airplane Mode and Do Not Disturb are on.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/2-control-center-status.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912587" /><br/>
If you're not sure what a displayed status icon means, you can now tap the icons to get details.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="3._set_multiple_timers">3. Set Multiple Timers</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-label-multiple-timers-ios/">Like iPhones running iOS 17</a>, you can now set multiple concurrent timers on Apple Watch. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/3-multiple-timers-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912582" /><br/>
Open the Timer app, create and start a timer, then tap the + button in the upper right corner to return to the Timers screen, where you can create and start another timer.<br/>
<br/>
With multiple timers counting down, you can use the Digital Crown to switch between timer displays, or alternatively you can keep track of them in the timer list. Tip: to assign a label such as "cupcakes" to a timer, use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. Raise your Apple Watch, then say something like "Set a 12 minute cupcakes timer."<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="4._access_the_app_switcher">4. Access the App Switcher</h2><br/>
In previous versions of watchOS, you could access the Dock by pressing the Side button, but in &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; this action has been reassigned to the Control Center. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/4-access-app-switcher.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912580" /><br/>
You can, in fact, still access the Dock (now called the App Switcher) with a double press of the Digital Crown. Turning the Digital Crown scrolls through apps, and the most recently used app appears at the front of the Dock with other apps behind it, in the order they were last opened. Apps that are currently running a session — a Maps navigation session or a Workout session, for example — appear at the front.<br/>
<br/>
You can also remove apps from the App Switcher: turn the Digital Crown to the app you want to remove, swipe left on the app, then tap X.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="_5._adjust_the_flashlight"> 5. Adjust the Flashlight</h2><br/>
When the flashlight it activated, you can now adjust the brightness intensity by turning the Digital Crown up and down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/5-adjust-flashlight.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912583" /><br/>
To turn on the flashlight, press the Side button to open Control Center, then tap the Flashlight button. Don't forget, you can also swipe left to choose a mode — steady white light, flashing white light, or steady red light.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="6._set_a_target_elevation_alert">6. Set a Target Elevation Alert</h2><br/>
In the compass app, you can set a target elevation and receive an alert after going beyond it. The new alert option is designed to help you stay safe and remind you to rest and acclimate as you move.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/set-target-elevation.jpg" alt="compass" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913731" /><br/>
Open the Compass app, tap the info (i) button, then tap Set Target Alert. Turn the Digital Crown to set the target elevation, then tap the check button, and you'll receive the alert when the elevation is exceeded.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="7._get_relative_waypoint_elevation">7. Get Relative Waypoint Elevation</h2><br/>
Each screen that shows the compass dial in the Compass app has a new Elevation button at the bottom of the display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/compass-3d-view.jpg" alt="compass" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913732" /><br/>
Tap it, and you'll get a 3D-like view of your waypoint elevations relative to your current elevation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="8._browse_waypoints">8. Browse Waypoints</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, you can browse waypoints, including those you’ve created in the Compass app as well as waypoints from guides in the Maps app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/browse-waypoints.jpg" alt="compass" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913777" /><br/>
In the Compass app, tap the info (i) button, then tap Waypoints. Tap Compass Waypoints, and you'll see any waypoints you’ve created as well as automatically generated waypoints such as the location of your parked car and the last estimated locations where cellular connectivity and Emergency SOS were available.<br/>
<br/>
You can also tap a guide, such as My Places or a guide you created in the Maps app, to view those waypoints on the compass. Note that waypoints that are more than 50 miles from you won’t appear on the compass dial. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="9._find_your_iphone_with_directions">9. Find Your iPhone With Directions</h2> <br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> share the same updated Ultra Wideband chip as can be found in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series, so if you have one of the latest Apple Watch models you can use Precision Finding to ping your nearby &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and get accurate directions to it. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/find-iphone-watch.jpeg" alt="find" width="2448" height="1632" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913780" /><br/>
On your Apple Watch, press the Side button to bring up the Control Center, then tap the Ping &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; button. Your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will play a sound and, if your &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; or Ultra 2 is within range, the screen will display a general heading and distance to your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and the size of the circle increases to guide movement in the correct direction. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="10._find_hiking_trails">10. Find Hiking Trails</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, you can use the Maps app to find hiking trails and learn more about them, including details like their name, length, highest and lowest elevations, and the distance from your current location to the nearest access point.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/maps-trails.jpg" alt="maps" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913734" /><br/>
In the Maps app, scroll to the area you want to search, tap the search button, then enter "trails" into the input field. Nearby trailheads will appear as green dots that you can tap, and the name of a trail appears near the bottom of the display. You can also turn the Digital Crown to browse through nearby trail results.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="11._view_offline_maps">11. View Offline Maps</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Apple has added the ability to download Maps for use offline, providing access to turn-by-turn directions and information for a chosen area even if you do not have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/downloaded-apple-maps.jpg" alt="maps" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909329" /><br/>
Offline maps are automatically available on Apple Watch when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is on and within Bluetooth range (about 33 feet or 10 meters). To learn how to download offline maps on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-offline-maps-ios-apple-maps/">see our dedicated how-to</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="12._view_maps_walking_radius">12. View Maps Walking Radius</h2><br/>
The Maps app now includes a new Walking Radius feature that shows you how long it will take to walk to points of interest around you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/maps-walking-radius.jpg" alt="maps" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913735" /><br/>
To change the radius, turn the Digital Crown. You can increase it to a walking time of up to 60 minutes. To change the radius unit to distance, touch and hold the map, scroll down, then tap Distance below Radius Unit.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="13._share_your_location">13. Share Your Location</h2><br/>
Like in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, you can now let others know where you are by sharing your location in Messages, and it will be updated in real time right in the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/share-location.jpg" alt="messages" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913736" /><br/>
Start a new message or open a conversation, tap the A button, then tap the Share Location button. You can then choose to show your live location (Share), which updates in real time, or share your static location (tap the pin icon, then tap Send Pin). <br/>
<br/>
If you share your live location, you can do so For One Hour, Until End of Day, or Indefinitely. To stop sharing your location, simply tap the shared location, then tap Stop Sharing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="14._start_a_group_facetime_call">14. Start a Group FaceTime Call</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, you can now start group <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> audio calls right on your Apple Watch. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/group-facetime.jpg" alt="phone" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913738" /><br/>
Open the Phone app on your Apple Watch, start a &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; audio call, then tap the ellipsis button and tap Add People to choose a contact. When someone joins the call, tap 2 People Active, tap the + button, then choose another contact.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="15._log_your_state_of_mind">15. Log Your State of Mind</h2><br/>
Using the Mindfulness app on Apple Watch, you can log your mood at different times throughout the day and input an overall mood for the day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/log-state-of-mind.jpg" alt="mental" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913741" /><br/>
Tap State of Mind, then tap either "Log how you're feeling right now," or "Log how you've felt overall today." Turn the Digital Crown to indicate how you're feeling then tap the checkmark button. You'll then be asked to choose words that describe how you're feeling and what's having the biggest impact on you.<br/>
<br/>
After you've logged your state of mind, you can check it against other lifestyle factors in the Health app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, under Mental Wellbeing -> State of Mind.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="16._record_video">16. Record Video</h2><br/>
For the first time on Apple Watch, in &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; you can use the Camera Remote app to record video from your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/record-video.jpg" alt="camera" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913750" /><br/>
Simply open the Camera Remote app, position your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to frame the shot using your Apple Watch as a viewfinder, turn the Digital Crown to zoom, then touch and hold the Shutter button to start recording video. Release the button to stop.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="17._plan_home_energy_usage">17. Plan Home Energy Usage</h2><br/>
In the Home app on Apple Watch, Apple has added a new "Grid Forecast" section like the one found on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;. The feature is designed to use your location to tell you when "clean" energy is available to use, so you can be mindful of when you're using energy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ios-17-grid-forecast.jpg" alt="" width="3189" height="1794" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910962" /><br/>
Open the Home app, then tap the Energy category to show the Grid Forecast. Green bars in the widget indicate when cleaner energy is available in your area. If there are no bars, cleaner energy isn't forecast for the near future.<br/>
<br/>
If you're traveling, Grid Forecast shows energy information for both your home location, and the location of your paired &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Note that Grid Forecast is available only in the contiguous United States.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="18._add_another_airplay_device">18. Add Another AirPlay Device</h2><br/>
While controlling audio on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> device such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, you can switch to or add additional &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; devices using the Now Playing app.<br/>
<br/>

On the Now Playing screen, tap the ellipsis (three dots) button. Tap &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj;, then add devices by tapping them. You can also stop playback on any device simply by tapping it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="19._type_to_speak">19. Type to Speak</h2><br/>
Using the Live Speech accessibility feature, you can type on Apple Watch and have your words spoken aloud, both in person and on phone and &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; audio calls. Live Speech can be set up on Apple Watch by going to Settings -> Accessibility -> Live Speech, where you can choose a voice to use. <br/>
<br/>

After setting up the Accessibility Shortcut (Settings -> Accessibility -> Accessibility Shortcut -> Live Speech) you can triple-click the Digital Crown and type what you'd like to have spoken out loud.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="20._change_your_email_signature">20. Change Your Email Signature</h2><br/>
By default, messages you send from your Apple Watch are signed with "Sent from my Apple Watch." Prior to &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, you couldn't customize your email watch signature, but now you can.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/mail-signature.jpg" alt="mail" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913773" /><br/>
Open the Watch app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, tap My Watch, tap Mail, then tap Custom. Tap Signature, then create your new signature.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="21._share_a_news_story">21. Share a News Story</h2><br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; introduces an option to share news stories in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a> from your Apple Watch. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/share-news.jpg" alt="news" width="1260" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913774" /><br/>
Open the News app on your watch, scroll to a story, then tap it. Scroll down, tap the Share button, then choose a sharing option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="22._ping_your_apple_watch">22. Ping Your Apple Watch</h2><br/>
For some time now, it's been possible to ping your misplaced &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with your Apple Watch. In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, you can now do the reverse and ping your Apple Watch with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; if you forgot where you put it down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/ping-watch-control-center.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903766" /><br/>
Apple doesn't include the new Ping My Watch button in the default Control Center set, but you can add it manually: Go to Settings -> Control Center, then under "More Controls," tap the + button next to Ping My Watch. (Okay, technically not a "&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; feature," but still worth knowing!)<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/22-hidden-features-watchos-10-apple-watch/">22 New Features You May Have Missed in watchOS 10</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/22-new-features-you-may-have-missed-in-watchos-10.2404798/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will begin using a new material to make its printed circuit boards thinner starting next year, according to a source with a good track record.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
Apple will reportedly switch to using resin coated copper (RCC) foil as a new printed circuit board (PCB) material in 2024. The change will apparently allow Apple to make its PCBs even thinner. Current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> PCBs are made from a flexible copper substrate material. A thinner PCB could free up valuable space inside compact devices like the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch to provide more room for larger batteries or other components.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro models are expected to grow in size from 6.1- and 6.7-inches to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">6.3- and 6.9-inches</a>, respectively. The increase in size is believed to be partly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/28/gurman-corroborates-iphone-16-pro-size-increase/">due to a need for more internal space</a> for additional components such as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/periscope-lens-exclusive-iphone-15-pro-max/">tetraprism telephoto camera</a> with 5x optical zoom and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">capacitive "Capture" button</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The information comes from an <a href="https://weibo.com/u/1833340431">integrated circuit expert</a> on Weibo, who was first to report that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> would retain the A15 Bionic chip, with the A16 being exclusive to the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ Pro models. Most recently, the user said that the A17 chip designed for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;‌ Plus will be made using a fundamentally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-first-chip-designed-for-standard/">different manufacturing process to the A17 Pro</a> in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> to cut costs.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phone-chip-expert/">Phone Chip Expert</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-looking-to-save-space-with-thinner-pcbs/">Apple Looking to Save Space in Future iPhones With Thinner Circuit Boards</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-looking-to-save-space-in-future-iphones-with-thinner-circuit-boards.2404787/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> brings over 50 new features and improvements to Apple's high-end smartphones compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro, which was released two years prior. This buyer's guide breaks down every major difference you should be aware of between the two generations and helps you to decide whether it's worth upgrading.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-13-Pro-vs-15-Pro-Feature-1.5-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913695" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro debuted in 2021, introducing a brighter display with ProMotion technology for refresh rates up to 120Hz, the A15 Bionic chip, a telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, Macro photography and photographic styles, Cinematic mode for recording videos with shallow depth of field, ProRes video recording, a 1TB storage option, and five hours of additional battery life. The &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro was discontinued upon the announcement of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro in 2022, but it is still possible to get hold of it second-hand.<br/>
<br/>
Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models is best for you and serves as a way to clearly see the all of the differences that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; brings to the table. This article focuses on the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, but to understand the differences between the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, see our other buyer's guide:<br/>

<br/>
Although the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; share most of their basic features, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; offers a large number of notable upgrades, such as a titanium design, 48-megapixel main camera, always-on display, Action button, USB-C port, and A17 Bionic chip.<br/>

Overall, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; is a significant upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro, introducing meaningful quality-of-life features like the USB-C port and Action button that change the methods of interaction with the device. The new, considerably more lightweight titanium design, slimmer borders around the display, and contoured edges result in a noticeably different aesthetic and feel in the hand.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; also brings major advancements to photography and videography, adding an Adaptive True Tone flash, a 48-megapixel main camera for high-resolution images and, on the larger model, a telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom. Software features such as Photonic Engine, Smart HDR 5, Next-generation portraits, Action mode, and a host of professional videography features like external recording and Log also take the photography and videography capabilities of the device to the next level.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to mention fast data transfer via USB 3, satellite connectivity, new color options, the second-generation ultra wideband chip, and the A17 Pro chip – Apple's first chip made with a &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; fabrication process, which radically improves the gaming capabilities of the device.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the scale and breadth of these improvements, most &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro will be able to justify upgrading to the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, especially if they value the new design, USB-C port, Action button, and camera improvements. It is only worth sticking with the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro if you are holding off for an even more substantial upgrade in the future, but many users will see tangible benefits by upgrading now.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-13-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 13 Pro vs. iPhone 15 Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 50+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-buyers-guide-50-differences-compared.2404752/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When Apple introduced second-generation ‌‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>‌, the Adaptive Transparency feature offered a new way to reduce loud environmental noise for more comfortable everyday listening. Adaptive Audio is designed to build on that approach by dynamically blending the existing Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation modes together to deliver the best audio experience in the moment, tailoring the noise control as the user between different environments and interactions. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/airpods-pro-2-ios-17.jpg" alt="" width="2407" height="1354" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900421" /><br/>
In this way, Adaptive Audio aims to automatically reduce loud or distracting noises in your surroundings, such as the sound of a leaf blower or a passing plane overhead, while other noises, like the sudden beep of a car horn, remain audible.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/new-airpods-pro-features-ios-17-how-to-use/">How to Use All the New AirPods Pro Features in iOS 17</a></li></ul><br/>
In a new interview with <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/25/apple-executives-break-down-airpods-new-features/">TechCrunch</a></em>, Apple's VP of sensing and connectivity Ron Huang revealed that Apple originally considered using GPS location to inform &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; of the user's whereabouts and adapt the audio experience accordingly. In real-world testing, however, the method proved inefficient. From the interview:<br/>
<blockquote>"During early exploration for Adaptive Audio, we basically put you in ANC versus transparency, based on where you are," says Huang. "You can imagine the phone can give a hint to the AirPods and say, "hey, you're in the house" and so forth. That is a way to do that, but after all our learnings, we don't think that is the right way to do it, and that is not what we did. Of course, your house is not always quiet and the streets are not always loud. We decided that, instead of relying on a location hint from the phone, the AirPods monitor your environment in real time and make those decisions intelligently on their own."</blockquote>Huang in the interview also returned to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/apple-on-airpods-pro-vision-pro-lossless-audio/">reason why</a> USB-C &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; can support Lossless Audio with Vision Pro thanks to the updated H2 chip's support for the 5GHz wireless band (second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; with a Lightning port only support 2.4GHz):<br/>
<blockquote>"Bluetooth typically runs on 2.4 gigahertz, and that airspace is very, very noisy," says Huang. "Everybody's running on 2.4. That's why routers Wi-Fi routers, for example, are typically dual-band if not tri-band, because the 5Ghz spectrum is that much cleaner. To get to really, really low latency audio, and to get to really high fidelity, lossless audio — it's all about a very, very clean and real-time channel between two. The combination of 5Ghz and the fact that they are very proximal allowed us to do that. We're able to basically redesign a brand new audio protocol over the 5Ghz for AirPods."</blockquote>Elsewhere in the interview, Huang touches on other features that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> brought to &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, including Conversation Awareness, Personalized Audio, and faster device switching. Priced at &#36;249 in the U.S., the updated second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; began arriving to customers late last week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/techcrunch-com/">TechCrunch</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-explored-gps-for-airpods-pro-adaptive-audio/">Apple Initially Explored Using GPS to Control AirPods Pro Adaptive Audio</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-initially-explored-using-gps-to-control-airpods-pro-adaptive-audio.2404738/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some Apple Watch users on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> have reported experiencing issues with Weather complications failing to display data on the watch face, despite the Weather app itself presenting no such issues. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/weather-complications.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913698" /><br/>
Apple Watch users have taken to the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-and-weather-rain-complication-problem.2403847/"><em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255145549">Apple's Support Community</a>, and other platforms to share their experiences. <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/25/watchos-10-weather-bug/?extended-comments=1#comments">9to5Mac</a></em> has highlighted the problem, and some <em>MacRumors</em> staff have seen its occurrence on their own watches. <br/>
<br/>
Affected complications appear blank where weather data should be showing, and yet tapping the complication reveals the expected information in the Weather app. The issue appears to be happening on various models whether they are on watchOS 10.0 or have been updated to the latest watchOS 10.0.1 update.<br/>
<br/>
Until Apple issues an update to correct the problem, one temporary workaround that users have had the most success with is to open the Watch app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and toggle the 24-Hour Time switch in the Clock app settings, wait a few seconds, then toggle it back to its original position. The paired Watch should update, and the affected complications should display weather data again (until they don't again – your mileage may vary).<br/>

		<title>iPhone 16 to Include an Additional Capacitive &#039;Capture&#039; Button</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> series is expected to gain an additional capacitive button, known internally as the "Capture Button." Codenamed "Project Nova," the button is likely to be one of the main selling points of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup, assuming it gets past the initial testing phase. The Capture Button is located on the same side as the Power button, only positioned slightly lower - where the mmWave cutout can be found on more recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models. The mmWave cutout has been moved to the opposite side, located under the volume buttons. It is currently unknown what the new capacitive button will be used for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
The Capture Button is expected to be a capacitive button rather than a standard mechanical one. Capacitive buttons, unlike mechanical buttons, do not move when pressed down. Instead, the button detects pressure and touch, providing haptic feedback through the use of haptic engines. The buttons are expected to work similarly to the Home Button on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, which mimics the press of a physical button through the built-in Taptic Engine. According to our sources, the capacitive buttons will feature force sensor functionality. Force sensors detect applied force, and convert the magnitude of force into electrical signals.<br/>
<br/>
Early in the development of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, Apple experimented with capacitive buttons on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the form of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-haptic-button-overview/#:~:text=Project%20Bongo%2C%20as%20it%20was,do%20not%20move%20when%20pressed.">the since-canceled Bongo project</a>. The Bongo module, unlike the Capture Button, consisted of capacitive Power and Volume buttons, and didn’t bring any additional buttons into the mix. Based on what we’ve heard from our sources, the Bongo module was canceled during the EVT stage of development, after unsatisfactory test results and a significant number of hardware issues. The cancelation left Apple engineers with ample room to reimagine the capacitive buttons for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; series, with an entirely new twist this time around.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the Bongo project, the Capture Button is set to make its debut across the entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup, including the base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 16 Plus. It is worth noting, though, that Apple also created a hardware configuration without the Capture Button button, possibly as a fallback variant in the event of continued hardware failure rates. The Capture Button has appeared on both eSIM-only units and devices with support for physical SIM card slots.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913688" /><br/>
Along with the new Capture Button, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is expected to gain a capacitive Action Button. Known as "Project Atlas," the haptic Action Button uses a design similar to the Capture Button, using strain gauges and reluctance motor to provide the necessary haptic feedback.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the Capture Button and upgraded Action Button, the base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; is expected to feature a redesigned camera bump, with vertical camera arrangement akin to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12. The Pro models are also set to feature an increase in screen size, from 6.1" and 6.7" to 6.3" and 6.9", respectively.<br/>
<br/>
It is important to consider that the information presented here is pre-production information. The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is still in the early stages of development, and the design has not been finalized. Because of this, there is always a chance that we may not see the Capture Button on the final product.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new FineWoven cases for iPhone 15 models have been heavily criticized since they were released earlier this month, with some customers and media outlets complaining about the fabric exterior being prone to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882255/apple-iphone-15-finewoven-case-wallet-bad">scratches</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/111119387802099507">stains</a>. We <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">recapped some of the negative feedback</a> last week, and complaints have continued to surface.<br/>
<br/>

In a <a href="https://512pixels.net/2023/09/finewoven-case-letdown/"><em>512 Pixels</em> blog post</a> on Sunday, Relay FM co-founder Stephen Hackett shared a photo of his FineWoven case with a misaligned USB-C port cutout, resulting in the pentalobe screw on the right side of the USB-C port being partially exposed.<br/>
<br/>
"It's one thing for these cases to be a letdown in terms of material, but this is a level of sloppiness that genuinely surprises me from Apple," he wrote. "I know not every example out there is as bad as mine, but the vibes around this case aren't good."<br/>
<br/>

On social media, some users claimed that the USB-C cutout only appears to be misaligned because of the angle that the photo was taken at, but other users responded with <a href="https://twitter.com/OprahsGift/status/1706087754847666583">straight-on photos</a> of the FineWoven case with the same issue. Not all of the cases have this issue, but multiple customers appear to be affected.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, <a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1705377239850951047">Parker Ortolani</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/HartleyCharlton/status/1706025920648114222"><em>MacRumors</em> editor Hartley Charlton</a> shared photos of FineWoven cases with visible damage on display at Apple Stores. An anonymous, alleged Apple Store employee <a href="https://twitter.com/LindaLominger/status/1706349826093273269">mentioned likewise</a> in a post on X, formerly Twitter.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here you can see FineWoven cases after less than a day on retail shelves.

Apple describes FineWoven as a "durable micro-twill" material made from 68% post-consumer recycled polyester, and said the material has a significantly lower carbon footprint than leather. Earlier this month, Apple announced that it would no longer use leather in any new products or accessories, as part of its environmental responsibility efforts.<br/>
<br/>
It's hard to measure exactly how much negative feedback there is for the new FineWoven cases, but the material certainly appears to be proving quite unpopular so far. We've reached out to Apple for comment, and we'll update this story if we hear back.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/finewoven/">FineWoven</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/">Apple&#039;s FineWoven Cases for iPhone 15 Continue to Be Heavily Criticized</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-finewoven-cases-for-iphone-15-continue-to-be-heavily-criticized.2404651/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new Magnetic Link bands for the Apple Watch are <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTJ53AM/A/41mm-evergreen-magnetic-link-s-m">now available to order</a> on Apple's online store, as <a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1706366154917245005">spotted by Parker Ortolani</a>. Priced at &#36;99, the bands are made with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">controversial new FineWoven material</a> instead of leather.<br/>
<br/>

Apple describes FineWoven as a "durable micro-twill" material with a "soft, suede-like feel." Apple says the material is made from 68% post-consumer recycled polyester, and has a significantly lower carbon footprint than leather, which the company no longer uses for accessories. However, FineWoven cases for iPhone 15 models have been heavily criticized since they were released earlier this month, with some customers and media outlets complaining that the material is very susceptible to visible scratches and stains.<br/>
<br/>
The bands are available in 41mm and 45mm sizes, and they are backwards compatible with other Apple Watch case sizes. Color options include Evergreen, Taupe, and Pacific Blue, and all of the bands are estimated to ship in 4-5 weeks.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-bands/">Apple Watch Bands</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-magnetic-link-now-available-to-order/">FineWoven Magnetic Link for Apple Watch Now Available to Order</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/finewoven-magnetic-link-for-apple-watch-now-available-to-order.2404644/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking the return of an all-time low price on the 256GB M1 MacBook Air, which is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;749.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;999.00. This deal originally debuted during Prime Day back in July and it remains one of the best MacBook-related discounts of 2023 so far.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/M1-MacBook-Air-Deals-Feature-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2125" height="1195" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850533" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the notebook in Gold and Silver at this price, and there's an estimated delivery date of September 27 to September 30 for the MacBook Air. As of writing, the Space Gray model is not matching this record low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;249 OFF</div>M1 MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;749.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are many internal and external differences between the 13.3-inch M1 MacBook Air and the newer 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch M2 MacBook Air models, but as an entry-level computer the M1 device should work great for common tasks, especially at this all-time low pricing.

		<title>iPhone 16 to Feature First A-Series Chip Designed Specifically for Standard Models</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The A17 chip designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus will be made using a fundamentally different manufacturing process to the A17 Pro in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> to cut costs, according to a rumor that has now been clarified by a reliable source.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/A17-Feature-Dark.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-901448" /><br/>
A <a href="https://weibo.com/u/1833340431">Weibo user</a> who claims to be an integrated circuit expert with 25 years of experience working on Intel's Pentium processors was first to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/23/apple-to-switch-tech-behind-a17-to-cut-costs/">float the rumor in June</a>. Now, the same source has clarified Apple's apparent plan for its standard iPhones' chip in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;'s A17 Pro chip is fabricated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/apple-tsmc-3nm-production-capacity/">using TSMC's N3B process</a>, but Apple reportedly plans to switch to the lower-cost N3E process for next year's standard A17 chip designed for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. This will mark the first time that Apple has designed a chip specifically for its standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models. In previous years, Apple simply gave the entire &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup the same chip before staggering them by one year between the standard and the Pro models starting with 2022's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The A15 Bionic chip in the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌‌ Plus is a higher binned variant with one additional GPU core than the A15 used in the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>‌ and ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;‌‌ mini, so some cross-generational differences despite outwardly featuring the same chip would not be unheard of, but this would effectively be the retention of the same name on a fundamentally different chip.<br/>
<br/>
N3B is TSMC's original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> node created in partnership with Apple. N3E, on the other hand, is the simpler and cheaper node that most other TSMC clients will use. N3E has fewer EUV layers and lower transistor density than N3B, resulting in lower efficiency. N3B has also been ready for mass production for longer than N3E, but it has much lower yield. N3B was effectively designed as a trial node and is not compatible with TSMC's successor processes including N3P, N3X, and N3S, meaning that Apple has to redesign its future chips to take advantage of TSMC's innovations.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was originally believed to be planning to use N3B for the A16 Bionic chip, but had to revert to N4 because it was not ready in time. It is likely the case that Apple is using the N3B CPU and GPU core design <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/23/iphone-14-pro-setback-removed-graphics-processor/">originally designed for the A16 Bionic</a> in the A17 Pro, before switching to the original A17 designs with N3E later in 2024. This architecture will presumably be iterated on through TSMC's successor nodes for chips like the "A18" and "A19."<br/>
<br/>
The Weibo user was first to say that the standard &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; models would retain the A15 Bionic chip, with the A16 being exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro models – a rumor that went on to be widely corroborated and turned out true. Earlier this month, Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-16-rumored-to-feature-enhanced-a17-and-8gb/">corroborated the rumor</a> about 2024's A17 chip being fabricated with N3E, adding that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus will also feature 8GB of memory, up from 6GB on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phone-chip-expert/">Phone Chip Expert</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-first-chip-designed-for-standard/">iPhone 16 to Feature First A-Series Chip Designed Specifically for Standard Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-to-feature-first-a-series-chip-designed-specifically-for-standard-models.2404586/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Repair website iFixit today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmQHgWNAg24">video teardown</a> of the new iPhone 15 Pro Max, providing a closer look inside the top-of-the-line device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Cameras.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913544" /><br/>
While the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a similar internal design as the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the device has a redesigned frame that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/iphone-15-pro-models-more-repairable/">allows the back glass panel to be easily removed</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/iphone-15-pro-cracked-glass-repair-fees-lower/">lower repair fees</a> for cracked glass for customers without AppleCare+ coverage. This change was first made to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus last year.<br/>
<br/>
The teardown provides a brief glimpse at the iPhone 15 Pro Max's upgraded Telephoto lens with a tetraprism system, which enables 5x optical zoom. iFixit said the Main and Ultra Wide lenses on the device appear to look the same as the ones on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, in line with <a href="https://twitter.com/Tech_Reve/status/1705409878481908094">information shared on social media</a> last week. This suggests camera improvements beyond 5x optical zoom are the result of the A17 Pro chip and software optimizations. <br/>

iFixit says the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a similar logic board as the iPhone 15 Pro. In addition to the A17 Pro chip, the teardown confirms that the device is equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X70 modem, which <a href="https://speedsmart.net/blog/post/2005/iPhone-15-Pro-up-to-24-Faster-5G-Download-Speeds">reportedly enables faster 5G speeds</a> as expected.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, iFixit gave the iPhone 15 Pro Max a low repairability score of 4/10, in part due to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ifixit-lowers-iphone-14-repairability-score/">Apple's parts pairing requirement</a> that it says harms independent repair shops.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/">Teardown</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-15-pro-max-teardown-ifixit/">iPhone 15 Pro Max Teardown: X70 Modem for Faster 5G, 5x Optical Zoom Lens, A17 Pro Chip, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-max-teardown-x70-modem-for-faster-5g-5x-optical-zoom-lens-a17-pro-chip-and-more.2404576/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple to Launch iPad Mini 7 Later This Year, Industry Report Suggests</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple could be preparing to release a seventh-generation iPad mini before the end of the year, based on a new report by <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230922VL207/digitimes-research-pc-ce-tablet.html">DigiTimes</a></em>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/ipad-mini-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-888416" /><br/>
In an article discussing stagnating global tablet demand in the second half of 2023, the Taiwan-based outlet forecasts an uptick in Apple's share of the market owing to orders for a "small-size" iPad in the fourth quarter. From the report (see bold): <blockquote>In the second quarter, iPad shipments had a sequential decline higher than those of non-iPad tablets, resulting in iPads' combined shipment share seeing two consecutive quarters of decline. However, the share will gradually pick up during the second half because of Apple's inventory replenishment needs in the third quarter and <strong>orders for a new small-size iPad in the fourth quarter</strong>, the figures show.</blockquote><em>DigiTimes</em> obtains its information from the suppliers who manufacture parts for iPhones and other Apple products. Its sources often provide reliable information, but the site has a mixed track record when it comes to interpreting that information and accurately deciphering Apple's plans. It is often best to view information from the site with some skepticism until the info is corroborated by additional sources, especially when it comes to rumors.<br/>
<br/>
That said, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman earlier this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/airpods-apple-watch-ipad-apple-tv-2023/">reported</a> that an iPad mini update with a minor "spec bump" is not out of the question. Last month, the leaker known as "ShrimpApplePro" also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/ipad-mini-7-could-be-coming-later-this-year/">suggested</a> a seventh-generation iPad mini was in the works at Apple, and said that they had seen evidence that at least one new iPad model is coming this year.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/new-ipad-mini-launching-next-year/">January</a> said he believes that the seventh-generation ‌iPad mini‌ is most likely to begin mass production in the first quarter of 2024, and Kuo recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">said</a> he does not expect any new iPad models this year.<br/>
<br/>
If anything happens before the holidays, a chip upgrade may be the most likely feature of a new ‌iPad mini‌. The ‌sixth-generation iPad mini‌ currently contains the A15 Bionic chip, while the new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro use the A16 and A17 Pro chip, respectively. A minor spec bump could also include upgrades to the front and rear cameras, potentially bringing features like Photonic Engine to the ‌iPad‌ for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
The latest iPad Pro models brought connectivity upgrades like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 to the ‌iPad‌ for the first time, so it seems highly likely that these capabilities will also make their way to the ‌iPad mini in the next update‌.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/">Apple to Launch iPad Mini 7 Later This Year, Industry Report Suggests</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-ipad-mini-7-later-this-year-industry-report-suggests.2404552/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/apple/en-us/">Resident Evil Village</a></em> will be released for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> on October 30, Capcom announced during the Tokyo Game Show over the weekend (via <em><a href="https://toucharcade.com/2023/09/24/resident-evil-village-iphone-ipad-release-date-price-resident-evil-4-remake-unlock-mobile-tgs-2023/">TouchArcade</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/resident-evil-village.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913495" /><br/>
During the event, Capcom also revealed pricing for the mobile ports of <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em>. While both games are free to start, they will require &#36;59.99 and &#36;39.99 in-app purchases, respectively, to unlock the full experience. <br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders have since gone live for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082"><em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> on the App Store</a>, which still lists the game as "Coming Soon – Expected December 31, 2023." Both games will support on screen controls, game controllers, multi-touch, HDR, and more.<br/>
<br/>
For those who haven't been following these games, <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> were showcased during Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; announcement. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are powered by an A17 Pro chip that features a brand new GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, enabling ported console games to be played on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at near-equivalent performance.<br/>
<br/>
DisplayPort support is built into the USB-C port on all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, meaning that the devices can also output video at up to 4K/60Hz natively to a DisplayPort-equipped external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable. On previous iPhones with a Lightning port, video mirroring is limited to 1080p with Apple's Lightning-to-HDMI or Lightning-to-VGA adapters.<br/>
<br/>
Since Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; event, Capcom confirmed that <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> will come to macOS and iPadOS devices with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or better. <em>Resident Evil Village</em> is already available on macOS, so the iOS and iPadOS release will be an independent purchase when it arrives just before Halloween with support for &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models. As a result, <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> will have cross-progression on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, while <em>Resident Evil Village</em> will have cross-progression on iPadOS and iOS only. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/toucharcade/">TouchArcade</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/capcom/">Capcom</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/resident-evil-village-iphone-15-pro-ipad-oct-30/">Resident Evil Village for iPhone 15 Pro and iPad Launches October 30</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resident-evil-village-for-iphone-15-pro-and-ipad-launches-october-30.2404542/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
