		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, Apple replaced the traditional mute switch with a new multi-function Action Button. The button can be assigned to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-how-to-customize-action-button/">perform a number of tasks</a>, ranging from activating the flashlight to turning on the camera. Perhaps the most useful way to use the Action Button is with Shortcuts, because the single button can perform more than one action at once or bring up a selection of tools.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/le7zAdF36R8" title="iPhone 15 Pro Action Button: Best Custom Shortcuts!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
We've rounded up three of the best methods for using Shortcuts to get the most out of the Action Button.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-multibutton-assign-two-shortcuts-to-the-same-action-button-press-on-iphone-15-pro/">MultiButton Shortcut</a></strong> - Federico Vittici of <em>MacStories</em> created a way for two separate shortcuts to be assigned to the Action button. With MultiButton, if you press the Action Button once, it runs the primary shortcut, but if you press it twice in quick succession, it will run a secondary shortcut. Since Apple doesn't support multiple presses for the Action Button, this is a clever workaround. The MultiButton Shortcut is available from <em><a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-multibutton-assign-two-shortcuts-to-the-same-action-button-press-on-iphone-15-pro/">MacStories</a></em>, and Viticci also has some Shortcut suggestions to use with the MultiButton.</li><br/>
 	<li><b><a href="https://twitter.com/vittortech/status/1705580354218701154">Position-Based Actions</a></b> - YouTuber Dan Vittorini created a Shortcut that performs different actions depending on the orientation of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> when it's activated. If the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is in portrait orientation, it toggles silent mode. If the phone is held with the top to the left, it takes a photo, and if the phone is held with the top to the right, it takes a video. You can, of course, customize these to your liking.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Shortcuts Folder</strong> - Perhaps the simplest way to make use of the Action Button is to set it to show the Shortcuts Folder, a unique action only available to the Action Button. You can set it to show all of your Shortcuts or just your favorites, so when you press the Action Button, you get a menu with your most useful Shortcuts. To set this up, open up the Settings app, choose Action Button, swipe over to Shortcut, tap on Choose a Shortcut... then select Show Folder and choose your preferred folder.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Three days after Apple said that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">would release a software update</a> with a fix for a bug contributing to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max overheating</a>, <em>MacRumors</em> can confirm that Apple is now internally testing iOS 17.0.3.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.0.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915213" /><br/>
It's unclear when iOS 17.0.3 will be released to the public, but the update will likely be available either later this week or next week.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not provide any specific details about the bug that it identified, but it said that it will not be reducing the performance of the A17 Pro chip with its planned software update. Apple also said the iPhone 15 Pro's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/">titanium frame is not to blame</a>, so it appears that the overheating issues are not the result of hardware deficiencies.<br/>
<br/>
The same bug fix should eventually be included in iOS 17.1, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">currently in beta</a> and is expected to be released in late October.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added that the overheating issues were also related to some apps overloading the A17 Pro chip, including Instagram, Uber, and racing game Asphalt 9: Legends. Apple said it was working with the developers of these apps to address the situation. Instagram already released an app update with a fix on Wednesday. Uber also updated its app today, but whether it addresses this issue remains to be determined.<br/>
<br/>
Not all iPhone 15 Pro users have experienced overheating, and it's unclear how many users have been impacted by the issue, but it should be fixed soon.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-preparing-ios-17-0-3/">Apple Preparing iOS 17.0.3, Likely With Bug Fix for iPhone 15 Pro Overheating Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-ios-17-0-3-likely-with-bug-fix-for-iphone-15-pro-overheating-issue.2406150/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Double Tap lets Apple Watch users double tap an index finger and thumb together to interact with the Apple Watch using one hand. The sensors in the Apple Watch are able to detect the fine movements, registering it as a tap on the display.<br/>
<br/>
The Double Tap gesture can be used to perform single-tap actions such as answering or ending a phone call, stopping a timer, playing and pausing music, snoozing or turning off an alarm, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Because Double Tap is enabled through the S9 chip in the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and Apple Watch Ultra, it is a feature that is limited to these models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/watchos-10-1-double-tap-support/">watchOS 10.1 Beta 2 Adds Support for Double Tap</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-beta-2-adds-support-for-double-tap.2406141/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that runs on the upcoming Vision Pro headset. The third beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-releases-third-visionos-beta/">came out in late August</a>, so it has been more than a month since Apple last released a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people will not have access to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta outside of Xcode, and it is not yet clear what Apple is adding in each &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is allowing developers to attend Vision Pro labs around the world, and developers who visit these locations are able to test the Vision Pro in person and get help from Apple engineers on their &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is not expected until early 2024, so Apple still has a lot of work to do on both hardware and software. We are expecting either this beta or a beta shortly after to introduce the official &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> that Apple has been working on.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-releases-visionos-beta-4/">Apple Continues Refining visionOS With Fourth Beta Release</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continues-refining-visionos-with-fourth-beta-release.2406138/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming one week after Apple released the first betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1.<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.1-On-iPhone-15-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915210" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 adds the option to favorite songs, albums, playlists, artists, and more, with favorited content added to the Library and used for suggestions. Favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen using the Now Playing widget, plus when starting a playlist, you'll now see Song Suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
AirDrop transfers can be finished over the internet so close proximity does not need to be maintained, and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 can now use NameDrop with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running iOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include a flashlight indicator in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> for non <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, and a Wallet feature that lets those in the UK connect their banks to see balances and transactions.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2406134/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

Registered developers can opt-in to the beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.1 includes updates for the Music app, introducing an option to favorite songs, albums, artists, and more. No other major new additions have been found in the beta as of yet, but there are several promised features that did not make it into the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that these features are coming in an update later this year, so we could begin seeing some of them in this beta.<br/>
<br/>
Additions we are waiting on include interactive Music widgets, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Sync improvements, the option to use Stickers through the Tapback menu in Messages, Intelligent form detection and Enhanced AutoFill for PDF documents and forms, an option to complete words by pressing the space bar, collaborative playlists in the Music app, and a favorite songs playlist.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-1-beta-2/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-1-to-developers.2406130/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>‌.1 update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌.1 Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, ‌watchOS 10.1‌ can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.1 adds NameDrop support for sharing contact information with another Apple Watch or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
NameDrop can be used by tapping into the Apple Watch Contacts app, selecting your profile, and tapping on the "Share" option. From there, touching the Apple Watch to another Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 or an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> will initiate a contact transfer.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-watchos-10-1-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of watchOS 10.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-watchos-10-1-to-developers.2406129/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a week after the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-beta-1-to-developers/">first tvOS 17.1 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. tvOS 17.1 adds a new favoriting option to the Music app on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of tvOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-tvos-17-1-to-developers.2406131/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-public-beta-1/">first iOS 17.1 beta</a> released last week, Reachability <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/16u283t/ios_171_db1_reachability_now_uses_a_pure_black/">now has a solid black background</a> on all iPhone models with the Dynamic Island, instead of a blurred view of the device's wallpaper. This minor change means the Dynamic Island no longer appears twice on the screen when Reachability is being used.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-1-reachability.jpg" alt="" width="1363" height="767" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915195" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image Credit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/16u283t/ios_171_db1_reachability_now_uses_a_pure_black/">throwmeaway1784</a></em></div><br/>
iPhone models with the Dynamic Island include the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
On older iPhone models without the Dynamic Island, Reachability still shows a blurred wallpaper as the background on the first iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
Reachability is an optional feature that lowers the top half of the screen so it's within easy reach of your fingers. The feature can be enabled in the Settings app under Accessibility → Touch → Reachability. To use the feature, simply swipe down on the bottom edge of the screen. To return to a regular view, tap the upper half of the screen.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 is expected to be released in late October. Last week, we outlined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/">other new features in the first beta</a> for Apple Music, AirDrop, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/reachability/">Reachability</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/ios-17-1-beta-reachability-black-background/">iOS 17.1 Beta Gives Reachability a Black Background on iPhones With Dynamic Island</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-beta-gives-reachability-a-black-background-on-iphones-with-dynamic-island.2406120/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple may be proceeding with plans to release a new Mac model this month, according to potentially related information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Logo-Spotlight.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912758" /><br/>
Details pertaining to imminent changes to Mac trade-ins provided to <em>MacRumors</em> by a verified source suggest that Apple will likely begin accepting new models for trade-in this month. Similar changes in June coincided with WWDC, when Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-trade-ins-mac-studio-m2-macboook-air/">began accepting</a> trade-ins of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and 13-inch &zwnj;M2&zwnj; MacBook Pro for credit towards new Apple product purchases. Apple simultaneously launched the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, second-generation &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, and Apple silicon <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>. As such, it seems plausible that a similar, albeit smaller, expansion of the Macs Apple accepts for trade-in this month may correlate with the launch of at least one new machine around mid-October.<br/>
<br/>
In July, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said October of this year could see the announcement of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/">first Macs with the M3 chip</a>. He said that the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> are all candidates for potential release this month.<br/>
<br/>
The as-yet-unannounced M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated with TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process for performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the current 5nm-based &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, which debuted in June 2022. It will also likely feature an all new GPU with hardware ray-tracing, first introduced on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>'s A17 Pro chip last month.<br/>
<br/>
In September, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that it seemed Apple will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">not launch new MacBook models</a> with M3 series chips before the end of this year. This may mean that the most likely Mac to be announced is a refreshed 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with the M3 chip. The current model featuring the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip has now been on sale for over two and a half years.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-mac-this-month/">Mac Trade-In Changes May Indicate New Model to Launch This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-model-to-launch-this-month.2406100/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The refurbished models are priced at &#36;249, down from &#36;299 for a brand new model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-Midnight-Closeup-Feature-Blue-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881768" /><br/>
Apple began selling refurbished HomePods <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-refurbished-homepod-2-select-countries/">in the U.K., Australia, Japan, and many other countries</a> last week. Availability has yet to begin in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its refurbished HomePods undergo full functionality testing, and they are inspected, cleaned, and repackaged in a plain white box with the power cord and documentation. The refurbished HomePods are covered by Apple's limited one-year warranty policy, and they are eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation HomePod has a similar design as the original HomePod that was discontinued in 2021, but with a larger backlit touch surface, two fewer tweeters, two fewer microphones, an indoor temperature and humidity sensor, and a few other changes.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a> is on track to launch in late 2025, according to Jeff Pu, a tech analyst at Hong Kong investment firm Haitong International Securities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866346" /><br/>
In a note to investors seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said that the first Apple Watch with a microLED display will launch in late 2025. The advanced display technology offers improved brightness, color reproduction, and viewing angles, making images look more like they are "painted" atop the glass.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, a Weibo leaker reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/next-major-apple-watch-upgrade-to-be-microled/">next worthwhile upgrade</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra users will be Apple's custom microLED display technology. Apple's plan to bring a microLED display to the Apple Watch Ultra is very widely corroborated, starting with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/">report</a> from display analyst Ross Young in January.<br/>
<br/>
After initially placing the device's launch in 2024, Young moved his forecast to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/apple-watch-ultra-second-half-2025/">second-half of 2025</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em>, on the other hand, reported a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/apple-custom-displays-microled-apple-watch/">2024 time frame</a> earlier this year. TrendForce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/04/apple-watch-ultra-microled-delayed-early-2026/">claims</a> that Apple's first microLED display will launch on a new Apple Watch Ultra model in 2026, due to supply chain adjustments. With Young and Pu, as well as leaks on Weibo, now pointing to a launch in 2025, the &zwnj;microLED Apple Watch&zwnj; Ultra may launch sooner than previously expected.<br/>
<br/>
The microLED display is expected to be 2.12-inches in size, a 10% increase over the display of the current Apple Watch Ultra. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/15/apple-custom-displays-heading-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-after-apple-watch/">reported</a> Apple is likely planning to bring custom microLED displays to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac after the technology debuts in a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra. He believes Apple's long-term plan is to bring microLED displays to all of its key products.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has started requiring new apps to show proof of a Chinese government license in order to be listed on the China App Store, as the company joins rival app stores that adopted the policy years earlier to meet tightening state regulations (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-enforces-new-check-apps-china-beijing-tightens-oversight-2023-10-03/">Reuters</a></em>). <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Dock.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833992" /><br/>
Apple last Friday began requiring an "internet content provider (ICP) filing" from developers when they submit new apps to be published on the local App Store. An ICP filing is the state registration system required for websites to operate legally in China. <br/>
<br/>
To get the license, developers must have a company in China or work with a local publisher, a requirement that has stymied take-up by a large number of foreign apps. <br/>
<br/>
Most local app stores including those operated by Tencent and Huawei have adopted the filing since at least 2017, so Apple is simply falling in line with a recently updated policy that is already established in China's software publishing industry.<br/>
<br/>
China already blocks the websites of many popular western social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, but iPhone users in China have been able to download their apps from Apple's ‌App Store‌ by using unauthorized VPN services that connect them to an internet server outside the country. <br/>
<br/>
Under new rules issued in July by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Apple will no longer be able to offer such apps in its China ‌App Store‌ from next July unless the app operators are registered with the government.<br/>
<br/>
Chinese officials last week reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/apple-china-discuss-rules-banning-western-apps/">told</a> Apple staff that the company must strictly implement the rules banning unregistered foreign apps, thereby closing the loophole allowing Chinese ‌iPhone‌ users to download them. Apple was said to have been told that the new rules are needed to crack down on online scams, pornography, and the circulation of information that violates China's censorship rules.<br/>
<br/>
Most foreign app operators are unlikely to register with the Chinese government, because doing so would force them to comply with data transfer and censorship requirements. This will leave Apple with no choice but to remove them or face legal sanctions.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-adopts-tighter-china-app-store-rules/">Apple Adopts Tighter Chinese App Store Rules, Closing Foreign App Loophole</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adopts-tighter-chinese-app-store-rules-closing-foreign-app-loophole.2406085/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> brings over 50 new features and improvements to Apple's high-end smartphones compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 Pro, which was released three years prior. This buyer's guide breaks down every major difference you should be aware of between the two generations and helps you to decide whether it's worth upgrading.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-12-Pro-vs-15-Pro-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915097" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro debuted in 2020, introducing the A14 Bionic chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, improved water resistance, Ceramic Shield glass, 2GB more memory, a LiDAR scanner, Night mode portraits and Apple ProRAW images, HDR video recording with Dolby Vision, and a larger display on the smaller model. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro was discontinued upon the announcement of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro in 2021, but it is still possible to get hold of it at fairly low prices second-hand.<br/>
<br/>
Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models is best for you by clearly showing all of the differences that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; brings to the table. This article focuses on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, but to understand the differences between the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, see our other buyer's guide:<br/>

<br/>
Although the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; share most of their basic features, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; offers a large number of notable upgrades, such as a titanium design, always-on Retina display with ProMotion, Action button, USB-C port, 48-megapixel main camera, A17 Pro chip, and longer battery life.<br/>

Overall, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; is a significant upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro, with significant changes in virtually every area of the device. The display's &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, always-on functionality, ProMotion technology for refresh rates up to 120Hz, slimmer bezels, and considerably higher peak brightness make for significant changes on the front of the device, while the switch to a titanium chassis, USB-C port, and Action button are similarly noticeable elsewhere. The photography and videography capabilities of the devices radically differ, with over 20 of the differences between the smartphones relating to camera technologies. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;'s more repairable design, 2GB of additional memory, and A17 Pro chip also ensure that it will be a more future-proof device.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the scale and breadth of these improvements, most &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro users will be able to justify upgrading to the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, especially if they value its more refined design, USB-C port, Action button, and camera improvements. It is only worth sticking with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro if you are holding off for an even more substantial upgrade with next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro, but many users will see a multitude of tangible benefits by upgrading now.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-12-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 12 Pro vs. iPhone 15 Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 50+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-12-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-buyers-guide-50-differences-compared.2406083/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify CEO Daniel Ek is urging lawmakers in the United Kingdom to adopt a bill that would regulate competition in digital markets, cutting down on the dominance of Apple, Google, and other large tech companies.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-vs-Spotify-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801789" /><br/>
The <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453">Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Bill</a> (DMCC) that the UK is developing would allow competition authorities to impose conduct requirements on companies and "promote competition" when a company's policies are "having an adverse effect on competition." Ek has long advocated for legislation that hobbles Apple's ability to both offer a platform (iOS) and compete on that platform with apps like Spotify rival <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f0138fee-5375-47b2-a717-a1eaf8038512">Financial Times</a></em>, Ek said that Apple and Google's control over how billions of consumers access the internet is "insane."<br/>
<br/>
"Not only are they dictating the rules, they also compete directly downstream with those providers," said Ek. Ek wants the UK bill to make sure that a company that's the referee in the digital market "can't also be the player." The DMCC needs to have "real teeth" he said, adding that the bill is for all developers. "More and more of these developers are now finding that Apple is a competitor," he said.<br/>
<br/>
If passed, the DMCC would give the UK's Competition and Markets Authority the power to impose multibillion-pound fines for large companies that breach the established rules. Tech companies would be required to provide more transparency about how their app stores work, with regulators able to open up specific markets like app stores or search engines.<br/>

Spotify has been in a feud with Apple for years, with the dispute between the two companies most recently heating up in 2022 when Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/spotify-audio-book-app-update-rejected-apple/">rejected a Spotify app update</a> that added audiobook support. Spotify back in 2019 filed a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/">regulatory complaint</a> in the European Union over Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> practices, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/apple-responds-to-eu-narrowing-antitrust-case/">still under investigation</a>, and the company has also backed the Open Markets Act in the United States, legislation that would require Apple to allow for sideloading and alternate app stores.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/spotify-apple-uk-legislation/">Spotify CEO on Apple and Google: &#039;If You Want to Be the Referee, You Can&#039;t Also Be the Player&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-ceo-on-apple-and-google-if-you-want-to-be-the-referee-you-cant-also-be-the-player.2406014/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella today said that he believes the search engine deal between Apple and Google has made it impossible for other search engines like Bing to compete (via <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-limits-of-ai-at-google-antitrust-trial-32d032a9">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>). With Google as the default search engine on Safari on all Apple devices, people become accustomed to using it, Nadella explained in testimony he gave during the ongoing Google vs. U.S. Department of Justice antitrust trial.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/microsoft-bing-chatgpt.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884498" /><br/>
"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you search on Google," said Nadella. "With that level of habit forming, the only way to change is by changing defaults." Nadella went on to say that Google is able to use its ~90 percent market share to improve search results, further reinforcing its monopoly. He said that it's "bogus" that there is choice in the search engine market.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft has been attempting to chip market share away from Google by adding OpenAI's chatbot technology to Bing, but Nadella says it is unclear how much AI can reshape the existing market because Google's distribution advantage doesn't go away. "I worry a lot about that," he said. "Even in spite of my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could become even more vicious because the defaults get reinforced."<br/>
<br/>
Last week, iTunes chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/">testified in the trial</a> and explained that Apple opts for Google as the default search engine on its devices because the company has "always thought it was the best." Google does pay Apple billions of dollars per year to remain the default search engine, though Cue claimed there is no valid alternative.<br/>
<br/>
Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/">Microsoft approached Apple</a> and offered up Bing as a potential acquisition target, but talks between Microsoft execs and &zwnj;Eddy Cue&zwnj; did not progress, both because of the money Apple gets from Google and concerns that Bing would not be able to compete with Google Search.<br/>
<br/>
Nadella is likely correct that it would be difficult at this point for any search engine to truly compete with Google, especially as long as Google remains the default search engine on Apple devices. The exception might be if Apple decides to develop its own search engine at some point.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-01/could-apple-replace-google-with-own-search-engine-it-s-possible-but-unlikely-ln7gywed">Sunday's edition of the Power On newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/19/apple-to-launch-search-engine-to-rival-google/">reiterated rumors</a> that Apple has considered creating its own search engine. Such a solution would be able to provide better privacy and deeper integration with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Spotlight, and Apple has already developed search tools that are used in apps like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea heads up a search team within Apple, and according to Gurman, that team has created a next-generation search engine for Apple apps. Codenamed "Pegasus," the search technology is able to provide more accurate results. While it is already used in some Apple apps, Apple will be expanding it to additional apps, such as the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
What Apple has now does not match the Google search engine, but Gurman argues that Apple could use it as the backbone for a full search engine in the future.<br/>
<br/>
There are still a few more weeks to go in the antitrust trial, and it is not yet clear what the outcome will be. If lawmakers target the lucrative deal between Apple and Google, the billions of dollars that Apple will lose could serve as a catalyst for Apple to further pursue its own search engine option.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bing/">Bing</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-on-apple-goole-search-deal/">Apple Deal Responsible for Google&#039;s Dominance in Search, Says Microsoft CEO</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-deal-responsible-for-googles-dominance-in-search-says-microsoft-ceo.2405987/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Original Apple Watch is Now Obsolete, Including &#36;17,000 Gold Model</title>

		<description><![CDATA[All first-generation Apple Watch models released in 2015 were added to Apple's obsolete products list on September 30, according to an internal memo obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. As a result, these outdated "Series 0" watches are no longer eligible for repairs or other service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Provider locations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Watch-Edition-Gold-2015.jpg" alt="" width="2117" height="1191" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915075" /><br/>
The list of obsolete models includes the first-generation Apple Watch Edition with an 18-karat gold casing, which cost up to &#36;17,000 in the U.S. when it was available. The solid-gold Apple Watch was discontinued in 2016 and replaced with a ceramic Apple Watch Edition, which was a more affordable luxury at up to &#36;1,299. On the software side, watchOS 5 dropped compatibility with the solid-gold Apple Watch in 2018.<br/>
<br/>
All other 38mm and 42mm aluminum and stainless steel versions of the original Apple Watch, including Hermès variants, are also now classified as obsolete.<br/>
<br/>
Apple classifies a product as technologically obsolete once more than seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. The original Apple Watch was discontinued in September 2016 upon the release of Apple Watch Series 2 and Series 1 models, so the first-generation models recently crossed that seven-year mark.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet updated its public-facing vintage and obsolete products list to reflect these additions, but that should happen soon.<br/>

		<title>Apple Pencil 3 Could Feature Magnetic Tips for Different Drawing Styles, Sketchy Rumor Claims</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> could be available with a range of interchangeable tips to emulate different drawing styles, according to a sketchy rumor shared by the X (formerly Twitter) user known as "<a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1708118363631743055?s=20">Majin Bu</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/m2-ipad-pro-apple-pencil-hover.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="596" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-869663" /><br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; will apparently come with different tips for drawing, technical drawing, and painting that connect magnetically. Majin Bu did not share any further details about the device. After a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil-3/">flurry of rumors</a> in 2021, rumors about a third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; model noticeably died down and nothing has been heard about the product until now.<br/>
<br/>
In March 2021, the leaker known as "Mr. White" shared an image purporting to depict a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/">next-generation Apple Pencil prototype</a> that featured a shorter design, glossy finish, and a larger, deeper tip. Apple was believed to have worked on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-working-on-smaller-apple-pencil/">smaller Apple Pencil</a> designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/apple-planned-iphone-apple-pencil/">&#36;49 model for the iPhone</a>, but both products never emerged and are said to have been canceled entirely.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that while Majin Bu often aggregates and shares information related to Apple's plans, they do not have a solid track record. The current &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is the second-generation version introduced alongside the 2018 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, meaning that it is one of the oldest Apple devices still on sale. As such, it is fairly likely that Apple has plans to launch a third-generation model at some point, and the company still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/">files patents</a> on new technologies for the accessory, but the latest rumor should still be taken with a pinch of salt until it is corroborated.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">Apple Pencil 3 Could Feature Magnetic Tips for Different Drawing Styles, Sketchy Rumor Claims</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips-for-different-drawing-styles-sketchy-rumor-claims.2405953/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
