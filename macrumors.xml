		<description><![CDATA[As part of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence</a> feature set, Apple on Monday announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow Siri to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/siri-can-access-chatgpt-with-ios-18/">access ChatGPT directly</a> in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia to provide better responses in relevant situations. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/google-gemini.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941761" /><br/>
In conversation with reporters after the WWDC keynote, Apple's senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi revealed that as Apple Intelligence evolves, the company eventually wants to give its users a choice between different AI models, and suggested that Google Gemini could be an option in the future. <br/>
<br/>
"We think ultimately people are going to have a preference for certain models they want to use, maybe one that's great for creative writing or one that they prefer for coding," said Federighi. "Maybe Google Gemini in the future. I mean, nothing to announce right now, but that's our direction."<br/>
<br/>
Federighi said that Apple's decision to start with ChatGPT was because the company wanted to "start with the best." ‌Siri‌ will leverage GPT-4o for free, with no need to create an account. Requests are not logged and IP addresses are obscured, while ChatGPT subscribers will also be able to access paid features within the experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are not included in the first beta of iOS 18, and instead will become <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-ios-18-beta/">available for testing over the U.S. summer</a>. iOS 18 is expected to be publicly released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/apple-add-more-ai-models-in-future/">Apple Likely to Add Google Gemini and Other AI Models to iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-add-google-gemini-and-other-ai-models-to-ios-18.2428815/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[During its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-recap/">WWDC 2024 keynote</a> on Monday, Apple introduced a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-calculator-ipad-apple-pencil/">Calculator app for iPad</a> that includes a new Math Notes feature, and there are similar changes to be found in the Calculator app in iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/calculator-app-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954866" /><br/>
The Calculator app on iPhone now has an additional button to switch between Basic, Scientific, and Math Notes in portrait or landscape view. Meanwhile, there's a useful new History feature that helps you keep track of previous calculations. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, a new Convert option supports unit conversions for length, weight, currencies, and more. Here's the full conversions that are supported:<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>Angle</li><br/>
  <li>Area</li><br/>
  <li>Currency</li><br/>
  <li>Data</li><br/>
  <li>Energy</li><br/>
  <li>Force</li><br/>
  <li>Fuel</li><br/>
  <li>Length</li><br/>
  <li>Power</li><br/>
  <li>Pressure</li><br/>
  <li>Speed</li><br/>
  <li>Temperature</li><br/>
  <li>Time</li><br/>
  <li>Volume</li><br/>
  <li>Weight</li><br/>
</ul>In iPadOS 18, the new Calculator app lets users type or write out mathematical expressions with an Apple Pencil and see them solved in their own handwriting. These Math Notes are automatically accessible in the Notes app in a new Math Notes folder that can be accessed on both iPhone and iPad.<br/>
<br/>
The first developer beta of iPadOS 18 is now available, with a public beta following in July, and official release to the public in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/ios-18-calculator-these-conversions/">iOS 18: Overhauled Calculator App Supports These 15 Conversions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-overhauled-calculator-app-supports-these-15-conversions.2428807/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Among the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-recap/">slew of iOS 18 updates announced</a> during Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> keynote, the company revealed a new way of paying for things with Apple Cash, called Tap to Cash.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tap-to-cash-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954862" /><br/>
As the name suggests, Tap to Cash lets users pay for things simply by tapping two iPhones together. The feature is reminiscent of NameDrop, where users can exchange contacts by tapping their devices together.<br/>
<br/>
Tap to Cash is an extension of Apple's Tap to Pay feature, and uses the same NFC functionality. Apple says that Tap to Cash allows users to transfer money without sharing any personal information, ensuring privacy is maintained.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also announced a few updates coming to Apple Wallet with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, including support for displaying information about rewards cards, such as points and redeemable gifts. Tickets for events will also gain better integration with the Wallet app, allowing users to see concert seat numbers, shortcuts for directions, and other information about events.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-cash/">Tap to Cash</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/tap-to-cash-ios-18-pay-touch-iphones/">Tap to Cash in iOS 18 Lets You Pay by Touching iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tap-to-cash-in-ios-18-lets-you-pay-by-touching-iphones.2428803/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 18 Lets You Hide App Labels on Your iPhone Home Screen</title>

		<description><![CDATA[As part of its Home Screen customization overhaul, iOS 18 lets iPhone users hide the labels on app icons for a cleaner look.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/hide-app-labels-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954851" /><br/>
Turning off the labels causes the icons to expand and take up the space where the text usually appears underneath. Here's how it currently works in the iOS 18 Developer Beta.<br/>
<ol><li>On the Home Screen, press and hold on an empty area.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the top-left corner.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Customize</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>In the customization menu that appears, tap the <strong>Large</strong> button.</li><br/>
<li>Tap anywhere on the Home Screen to save your preference.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/hide-app-labels-home-screen-ios-18.jpg" alt="Home Screen" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954852" /><br/>
<br/>
As things stand, it's not possible to hide labels and keep app icons small, but this could change in succeeding beta versions.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to hiding app labels, other new Home Screen customization options in iOS 18 include the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-home-screen/">place app icons anywhere, and a dark tint option</a> for app icons.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the new Passwords app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, there's a feature that is designed to allow websites and apps to upgrade existing accounts to passkeys automatically.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-passkey-upgrade.jpg" alt="" width="1896" height="1067" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954844" /><br/>
Enabled by default, the feature will speed up the adoption of passkeys, which are more secure than a traditional login and password. Passkeys log you in with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> rather than a password, and because on-device authentication is required, passkeys put a stop to online attacks like phishing. There's no password to steal or authentication code that can be intercepted.<br/>
<br/>
Several popular websites and services have implemented Passkey support since Apple started using passkeys in 2022, including Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, TikTok, PayPal, Best Buy, Microsoft, PlayStation, and eBay.<br/>
<br/>
Passkeys are supported in the new Passwords app that's available in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, iPadOS 18, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, and Windows PCs through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> for Windows. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a few WWDC 2024 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10112/">coding</a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10111">sessions</a> related to its upcoming next-generation CarPlay system ahead of its launch later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Gen-CarPlay-WWDC24-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954798" /><br/>
The sessions include lots of updated next-generation CarPlay images, with one revealing new Vehicle, Media, and Climate apps in action for the first time. <em>MacRumors</em> previously discovered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/">evidence of these apps in the iOS 17.4 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Next-generation CarPlay will be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to uniquely match their vehicles. Apple revealed a variety of different design options and layouts that will be possible, as shown below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-2.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954801" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-3.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954802" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-4.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954803" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-5.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954804" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-6.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954805" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-7.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954806" /><br/>
Other images provide a closer look at the Vehicle and Climate apps, which will house vehicle settings and climate controls, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Vehicle-Settings.jpg" alt="" width="1579" height="784" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954824" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-WWDC-2024-Climate-Controls.jpg" alt="" width="2410" height="1201" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954822" /><br/>
Next-generation CarPlay will allow automakers to show custom alerts related to an electric vehicle's charging status, an available software update for the vehicle, and more. In addition, it will feature rear-camera integration, as shown below. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-WWDC-2024-Charging.jpg" alt="" width="1576" height="777" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954826" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Vehicle-Software-Update.jpg" alt="" width="1574" height="782" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954816" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Rear-Camera.jpg" alt="" width="1574" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954815" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple's website</a> continues to say that the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay will arrive in 2024, but it has yet to provide a more specific timeframe, and it did not provide any timing-related updates in the WWDC coding sessions. Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed next-generation CarPlay vehicle designs</a> late last year.<br/>

		<title>iOS 18 Apple Intelligence Feature Will Have Waitlist During Initial &#039;Limited Preview&#039;</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Intelligence features that will be introduced later during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> beta testing process will have a waitlist at first, according to code in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; found by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-Apple-Intelligence-hero-240610.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954530" /><br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, Apple Intelligence is codenamed Graymatter. There are references to a waitlist, with specific strings that say "Join the Graymatter Waiting List" and "Joined Waitlist." There is also wording that refers to it as a "limited preview."<br/>
<blockquote>"While Graymatter is in limited preview, you may experience unusually slow responses when not in a supported region."</blockquote><br/>
Apple plans to introduce Apple Intelligence during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-ios-18-beta/">iOS 18 beta testing period</a> this summer, so the limited preview and waitlist may be something that Apple will use during the beta testing period.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible, however, that there will be a waitlist when Apple Intelligence launches publicly in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; given some of the issues that other AI services like ChatGPT have experienced at times due to demand. While <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users will need an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or later to access Apple Intelligence, it will also be available on all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, which will launch with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; installed, increasing the number of people using the feature at launch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-apple-intelligence-limited-preview/">iOS 18 Apple Intelligence Feature Will Have Waitlist During Initial &#039;Limited Preview&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-apple-intelligence-feature-will-have-waitlist-during-initial-limited-preview.2428769/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> and the Home app weren't focused on much during Apple's WWDC keynote, but there are several new features that are coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/home-app-ios-18-features.jpg" alt="" width="2926" height="1646" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954758" /><br/>
With Customize Access, you can manage how and when people can access your &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; devices like garage openers, alarm systems, and door locks. You can create guest schedules and specific accessories that your guests can use, limiting times that your home is accessible. A home hub is required for this feature.<br/>
<br/>
You can enable Express Mode for unlocking door locks automatically as you approach with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or an Apple Watch, so you don't need to tap your device to the lock to get it to open. You'll need an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or Apple Watch with an Ultra Wideband chip for this to work, along with an Ultra Wideband lock.<br/>
<br/>
Later this year, Apple plans to add support for robot vacuum cleaners. The Home app will support the core functionality of robot vacuums, like power control, cleaning mode, vacuum, mop, and charge status. The vacuums can also be used in automations and scenes, and respond to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> requests.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is adding electricity usage integration into the Home app, but it's only available to select Pacific Gas and Electric Company customers in the United States to begin. With this feature, users can see their home electricity usage from the Home app, along with rate plan.<br/>
<br/>
Electricity usage integration is coming later in 2024, and Apple also plans to add other providers in the future.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-homekit-features/">HomeKit in iOS 18 Includes Guest Access, Hands-Free Unlock, Electricity Usage Integration and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homekit-in-ios-18-includes-guest-access-hands-free-unlock-electricity-usage-integration-and-more.2428763/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple and Canon today <a href="https://global.canon/en/news/2024/20240611.html">announced</a> the development of a new mirrorless camera lens designed to capture spatial video for the Vision Pro headset. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/canon-spatial-lens.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="840" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954752" /><br/>
Canon's RF-S7.8mm F4 STM DUAL lens is specifically intended to capture spatial video content, tailored for use with Apple's Vision Pro headset. The new lens is designed for the Canon EOS R7 camera and features dual optics, mimicking the human field of view.<br/>
<br/>
The RF-S7.8mm F4 STM DUAL lens features a high-speed autofocus mechanism, ensuring that even in challenging lighting conditions, videographers can capture clear spatial video. After recording, the footage can be processed using Canon's EOS VR Utility app, which transforms the video into spatial content optimized for the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The announcement marks a significant step in the effort to create more content for the Vision Pro. The RF-S7.8mm F4 STM DUAL lens is set to be available later this fall, with pricing details yet to be announced.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/canon/">Canon</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/canon-lens-for-spatial-video/">Apple and Canon Announce Mirrorless Camera Lens Designed for Spatial Video Capture</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-canon-announce-mirrorless-camera-lens-designed-for-spatial-video-capture.2428759/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

During Apple's keynote event, Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, emphasized that users will have full control over when ChatGPT is used and that data shared with OpenAI would not be logged or stored. "You are in control over when ChatGPT is used and will be asked before any of your information is shared," Federighi said.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these assurances, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk">Musk expressed</a> strong opposition to the integration on his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter). Musk said, "If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation." He continued, "Visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage." He also repeatedly questioned Apple's ability to ensure data security, stating, "Apple has no clue what's actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They're selling you down the river."<br/>
<br/>
Apple and OpenAI have both emphasized that user data will only be shared with explicit consent and that these interactions are designed to be secure. OpenAI noted in a new <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-apple-announce-partnership/">blog post</a> that "requests are not stored by OpenAI, and users' IP addresses are obscured." Users can also choose to connect their ChatGPT accounts to access paid features, but this is an opt-in feature.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been clear in its messaging that the new AI capabilities are designed with user privacy at the core. Apple's approach leverages a combination of on-device processing and cloud computing, ensuring that data is not stored in the cloud. Apple's integration of ChatGPT into its operating systems is part of a broader strategy to enhance the AI capabilities of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/elon-musk-threatens-to-ban-apple-devices/">Elon Musk Threatens to Ban Apple Devices Over ChatGPT Integration</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/elon-musk-threatens-to-ban-apple-devices-over-chatgpt-integration.2428757/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple has replaced the Private Wi-Fi Address option for Wi-Fi networks with a new Rotate Wi-Fi Address option that's aimed at better minimizing tracking.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/rotate-wifi-address-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="2553" height="1436" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954724" /><br/>
Available when accessing the settings of any Wi-Fi network, Apple says the opt-in Rotate Wi-Fi Address feature changes your Wi-Fi address at random times.<br/>
<blockquote>A rotating Wi-Fi address helps reduce tracking by changing your Wi-Fi address at various times. Tracking can happen when your address always appears the same to other devices and people using the same network as you.</blockquote><br/>
The prior Private Wi-Fi Address setting assigned a different MAC address to a device for each Wi-Fi network it connected to.<br/>
<br/>
Rotate Wi-Fi Address, like Private Wi-Fi Address, is separate from the additional Limit IP Address Tracking option that can be turned on for Mail and Safari.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-rotate-wifi-address/">iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia Add &#039;Rotate Wi-Fi Address&#039; Option to Cut Down on Tracking</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-and-macos-sequoia-add-rotate-wi-fi-address-option-to-cut-down-on-tracking.2428755/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[macOS Sequoia is still compatible with several Intel-based Macs, but it does drop support for 2018 and 2019 models of the MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/sequoia.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954485" /><br/>
macOS Sequoia is compatible with the following Macs, according to Apple:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>MacBook Pro:</strong> 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>MacBook Air:</strong> 2020 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac mini:</strong> 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>iMac:</strong> 2019 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>iMac Pro:</strong> 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac Studio:</strong> 2022 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac Pro:</strong> 2019 and later</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">"Apple Intelligence" suite of AI features</a> will require an Apple silicon Mac with an M1 chip or newer. The new AI features can help you write faster, categorize mail, prioritize notifications, and more. A smarter version of Siri powered by Apple Intelligence will also be limited to Macs with an M1 chip or newer.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-announces-macos-sequoia/">iPhone Mirroring</a> will be available on both Apple silicon Macs and Intel-based Macs with the T2 security chip, letting you control your iPhone from your Mac's screen:<blockquote>A user's custom wallpaper and icons appear just like on their iPhone, and they can swipe between pages on their Home Screen, or launch and browse any of their favorite apps. The keyboard, trackpad, and mouse on Mac also let a user interact with their iPhone, and audio even comes through. Users can seamlessly drag and drop between iPhone and Mac, and a user's iPhone remains locked, so nobody else can access or see what the user is doing. It also works great with StandBy, which stays visible, so users can get information at a glance. Additionally, users can review and respond to iPhone notifications directly from their Mac.</blockquote>As for iPadOS 18, the update drops support for the first-generation 10.5-inch iPad Pro, second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and the sixth-generation low-end iPad.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 18 is compatible with the following iPads, according to Apple:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>iPad Pro: 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li>iPad Air: 2019 and later</li><br/>
<li>iPad mini: 2019 and later</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is improving privacy in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, introducing a feature that allows apps to be locked or hidden, which makes them inaccessible without a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> scan.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-lock-apps.jpg" alt="" width="5560" height="3128" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954703" /><br/>
If someone is using your phone and you've locked an app, when they try to open that app, they'll see a popup that says it can't be accessed without secondary authentication. Locking an app can be done by long pressing on it and selecting the Require &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; option (or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>).<br/>
<br/>
Not all apps can be locked, with Apple not providing an option for innocuous apps like Maps, Clock, Calculator, and Stocks, but almost every other app can be locked, including third-party apps. When you lock an app, you have the option to hide it as well, which moves it into a locked, hidden apps folder that requires authentication to open.<br/>
<br/>
Locked or hidden apps are not only unable to be opened, but also hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the operating system. Enabling a lock on an app also shows the apps that have access to it, such as apps that are able to write images to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app. Hiding an app means that you will not receive incoming notifications or calls from it, and it will only be available from a "Hidden" folder in the App Library.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to turn off the locking feature, you can long press on an app icon and choose the "Don't Require &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;" option. Turning the lock on and off requires a &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; scan, so it can't be turned off without your knowledge. Locking and hiding apps is also a feature that works on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-hide-lock-apps/">iOS 18 Lets You Lock and Hide Your Apps for Added Privacy</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-lets-you-lock-and-hide-your-apps-for-added-privacy.2428745/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the interesting new features coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will let you automatically record and transcribe your live phone calls through the Phone app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Phone-App-Icon-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954687" /><br/>
After answering a call or placing a call, you can enable recording. All call participants are notified that the call is being recorded, so there are no surprises and everyone is aware of the recording from the start. As the call is recorded, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is also able to provide a transcript. <br/>
<br/>
The upcoming Apple Intelligence features can generate a summary of key points that were included in the call, so you can look back at what was important at a glance. <br/>
<br/>
Phone call transcription will be available in English (U.S., UK, Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore), Spanish (U.S., Mexico, Spain), French (France), German (Germany), Japanese (Japan), Mandarin Chinese (China mainland, Taiwan), Cantonese (China mainland, Hong Kong), and Portuguese (Brazil).<br/>
<br/>
Other new features for the Phone app include a search interface for call history, autofill for a number when you start typing in digits, and the option to seamlessly switch SIM cards. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to bring the same audio and transcription features to the Notes app, so you can record audio and get a live transcript on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 and later. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-record-phone-calls/">iOS 18 Can Record and Transcribe Your Phone Calls</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-can-record-and-transcribe-your-phone-calls.2428741/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-journal-app.jpg" alt="" width="4800" height="2700" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954669" /><br/>
The all-new insights view offers a comprehensive overview of journaling activities. This includes tracking writing streaks, displaying a calendar with existing entries, and providing fun statistics that encourage users to write more frequently. <br/>
<br/>
The updated Journal app now includes advanced search and sort functionalities. Users can easily locate specific entries and organize their journal for easier accessibility. <br/>
<br/>
Time spent journaling can now be recorded as mindful minutes and users can log their state of mind directly within the Journal app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has introduced new widgets for the Journal app, available on both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> and Lock Screen. These widgets allow users to quickly start a new entry, view their current streaks, and receive writing prompts throughout the day. <br/>
<br/>
The Journal app also gains automatic transcription for audio recordings, allowing users to capture their thoughts and ideas verbally, with the app converting spoken words into text entries. <br/>
<br/>
The app now supports exporting of journal entries, allowing users to save entries offline or share them in printed form.<br/>
<br/>
The Journal app made its debut on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in December 2023, but it remains unavailable in iPadOS 18 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-brings-new-insights-to-journal-app/">iOS 18 Brings New Insights, Widgets, and Health Integration to Apple&#039;s Journal App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-brings-new-insights-widgets-and-health-integration-to-apples-journal-app.2428736/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

And with iOS 18, Apple has taken this feature a step further by adding new 85%, 90%, and 95% charging limit options.<br/>

<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-first-developer-betas-new-software/">first iOS 18 beta</a> is now available for Apple Developer Program members, and a public beta will follow in July.

Users can now swap out the two controls at the bottom of the Lock Screen for a different action of their choosing. Shortcuts to functions like Translate, Notes, and music recognition in Shazam, and more are available. The full list of actions is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here are all the options to replace the camera and flashlight buttons on the Lock Screen on iOS 18 <a href="https://t.co/ZS6j5xWQzF">pic.twitter.com/ZS6j5xWQzF</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1800257722673181161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
