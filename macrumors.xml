		<description><![CDATA[In addition to adding support for alternative app marketplaces and alternative payment methods in the European Union, Apple is making several other changes to comply with the terms of the Digital Markets Act. Apple today outlined some of its upcoming plans in a DMA Compliance Report [<a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/dma/dma-ncs.pdf">PDF</a>].<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/transfer-to-android.jpg" alt="" width="1240" height="698" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940141" /><br/>
Apple is going to make it easier for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to switch over to another operating system in the European Union. Apple says it is working on a solution that will help mobile operating system providers create "more user-friendly solutions" for transferring data from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to a non-Apple phone. The solution will be available by fall 2025, after which point companies like Samsung and Google will be able to offer better tools for transferring data from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
EU &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users will be able to remove Safari from their devices entirely starting at the end of 2024, with an alternate browser able to take the place of Safari. As part of this plan, Apple is developing a browser switching solution for exporting and importing browser data into another browser on the same device. Apple has already began supporting alternative web browser engines, another DMA requirement.<br/>
<br/>
To improve interoperability between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and other smartphone platforms, Apple is allowing third-party payment apps to access the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s NFC chip for contactless payments that are not done through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, plus it is allowing developers to submit requests for additional interoperability.<br/>
<br/>
Interoperability requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they are under the scope of the DMA, and if an effective interoperability solution can be developed.<br/>
<br/>
Developers in the EU are able to <a href="https://www.cedr.com">request additional mediation</a> that goes beyond the standard App Review Board evaluation. Developers who want to contest unsuccessful appeals to the App Review Board can request mediation, a process that Apple says is "EU-based, easily accessible, impartial, independent, and free-of-charge."<br/>
<br/>
All of these changes are limited to developers and users in the European Union as they are required by the Digital Markets Act.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-eu-safari-android-changes/">Apple to Let EU iPhone Users Delete Safari and More Easily Transition to Android</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-let-eu-iphone-users-delete-safari-and-more-easily-transition-to-android.2421315/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912513" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/watchOS-10-Launch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new software for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, debuting &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; Software 17.4. The update comes over a month after the last &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; software release.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-Midnight-Closeup-Feature-Purple-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881769" /><br/>
With &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; Software 17.4, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is able to learn what a user's preferred media service is, eliminating the need to set a third-party app as the default or include an app name when asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to play content.<blockquote>This update enables Siri to learn your preferred media service, so you no longer need to include the name of the media app in your request.</blockquote>Apple has removed the Home app option that let users select a default media service as a result of the new feature addition. The change brings the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; in line with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, which already offer the option to provide a default music service selection to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; when making a song request for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Third-party apps that work directly with the ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌ include YouTube Music, Deezer, Pandora, TuneIn, and iHeartRadio. Streaming music services need to support ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌ for the feature to work, and not all do, such as Spotify. You can play Spotify content on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; by asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, but it routes the song through the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Along with ‌&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌ support for a preferred music service, the ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌ 17.4 update also includes performance and stability improvements.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-4/">Apple Releases HomePod Software 17.4 With Music Preference Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-4-with-music-preference-update.2421308/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; updates can be installed by going to the Settings app on the Vision Pro, selecting the General section, and choosing Software Update. The Vision Pro headset will need to be removed to install new software, with a progress bar available on the front EyeSight display.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is making several improvements to the Vision Pro with the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update. Mobile Device Management is available for businesses, and Persona and EyeSight look better than before.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118110">today clarified</a> that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the European Union can continue to update and use apps from alternative app marketplaces for a 30-day period when leaving the EU.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
With the release of iOS 17.4, Apple published a number of support documents, and one of the pages <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/alternative-ios-app-stores-eu-grace-period/">outlined what happens</a> when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user with apps installed through an alternative app marketplace leaves the EU. At the time, the document said that there would be an unspecified "grace period," but Apple has now updated it to provide exact timing.<br/>
<br/>
EU &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who travel outside of the area can expect to be able to update apps installed through alternative app marketplaces for a 30-day period, but after that, apps will not be able to be updated.<br/>
<br/>
Installing alternative app marketplaces and the apps in those marketplaces is restricted to the European Union at all times, so travelers will not be able to install new apps through a marketplace while out of their home country or one of the 27 countries in the EU. Apps that have been downloaded can continue to be opened and used, even if they can't be updated.<blockquote>If you leave the European Union, you can continue to open and use apps that you previously installed from alternative app marketplaces. Alternative app marketplaces can continue updating those apps for up to 30 days after you leave the European Union, and you can continue using alternative app marketplaces to manage previously installed apps. However, you must be in the European Union to install alternative app marketplaces and new apps from alternative app marketplaces.</blockquote><br/>
Apple makes it clear that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who want to install apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> must be physically located in a country in the European Union and their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> must also be set to a country or region in the EU. Apple uses privacy-focused on-device processing to determine whether a user is eligible to install an alternative app marketplace.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/alternative-apps-30-day-update-period/">iOS Apps From Alternative Marketplaces Can Be Updated for 30 Days Outside of EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-apps-from-alternative-marketplaces-can-be-updated-for-30-days-outside-of-eu.2421304/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

More details from the announcement:<blockquote>With Tap to Pay on iPhone, Venmo business profile and PayPal Zettle users in the U.S. can get set up in minutes and begin securely accepting contactless cards and digital wallets directly on their iPhones. They can also add taxes, accept tips, send receipts, and issue refunds. In addition, funds from sales will settle quickly into a business's Venmo or PayPal Zettle account, helping to streamline operations and manage cash flow.</blockquote>PayPal had already been testing Tap to Pay on iPhone with an early access program, and the feature is now available to all merchants.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/08/apple-announces-tap-to-pay-iphone-feature/">Launched in the U.S. in 2022</a>, Tap to Pay on iPhone allows for iPhone-to-iPhone contactless payments, with no additional point-of-sale hardware from companies like Square or Clover required. The feature allows customers to tap their iPhone or Apple Watch, credit card, or other contactless payment option on the merchant's iPhone. Payment is securely completed using the same NFC technology behind Apple Pay.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has gradually expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to additional countries, such as Australia, France, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the U.K. Other popular payment platforms that support the feature include Square and Stripe.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-paypal-venmo/">PayPal and Venmo Launch Tap to Pay on iPhone for U.S. Businesses</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/paypal-and-venmo-launch-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-for-u-s-businesses.2421297/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Additionally, Amazon has steep discounts on AirTags and iPhone 15 cases.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/magsafe-duo-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939069" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Woot and Amazon.

You'll find an estimated delivery between March 19 and March 21, although those dates may change depending on your location.<br/>
<br/>
The highlight of the sale is the MagSafe Duo Charger for <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-magsafe-duo-fast-wireless-charger%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_1"><strong>&#36;74.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00.

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip</a> launch this Friday. Ahead of time, the first reviews and unboxing videos  for the laptops have been shared by some media outlets and YouTube channels.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/macbook-air-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939665" /><br/>
Key new features added to both MacBook Air models include Apple's M3 chip for faster performance, Wi-Fi 6E support, expanded external display support, an anodization seal that reduces fingerprints on the Midnight finish, and microphone improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Reviews</h2><br/>
<h3>M3 Chip</h3><br/>
Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air are now available with the M3 chip for faster performance and improved power efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
As expected, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/first-benchmark-result-macbook-air-m3/">early benchmark result</a> revealed that the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip in the previous MacBook Air models in terms of CPU performance. These results are consistent with the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Jason Snell shared benchmark results in his <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-review-more-of-a-good-thing/">review on <em>Six Colors</em></a>:<br/>
<br/>

With the M3 chip, the MacBook Air has also gained hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games, along with AV1 video decoding.<br/>

<h3>Two External Displays</h3><br/>
While previous MacBook Air models with Apple silicon officially support only one external display, the new models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-two-displays-lid-closed/">support two external displays</a>. However, a second display can only be used when the MacBook Air's lid is closed.<br/>
<br/>
When the lid is open, the new models support one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz. When the lid is closed, a second display with up to 5K resolution at 60Hz can be connected, according to Apple's tech specs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-MacBook-Air-Two-External-Displays.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="676" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940064" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image Credit: CNET</em></div><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-inch-2024-review-the-everything-laptop/"><em>CNET</em>'s Joshua Goldman</a>:<blockquote>With the M3 MacBook Airs, you can connect two external displays directly to the Thunderbolt USB-C ports, which will also power the MacBook. <br/>
<br/>
However, doing this comes at the cost of the MacBook Air's display; the lid must be closed in order to drive both external monitors. On the surface, this doesn't seem like much of an issue, unless you typically use your laptop's keyboard and trackpad while working on an external display. For me, the bigger hiccup is the loss of Touch ID on the Air's keyboard. You can just open and close the lid to use Touch ID, but I use mine so much during the day that that would get old really fast. The better option is to get Apple's Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, and while you're at it, pick up a Magic Trackpad or Mouse to complete the package.</blockquote>Even more displays can be connected to the MacBook Air with the use of DisplayLink adapters. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Fingerprint Seal for Midnight Color</h3><br/>
Just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/">like the Space Black MacBook Pro</a>, the Midnight MacBook Air now features an "anodization seal to reduce fingerprints," according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.thestreet.com/technology/apple-13-inch-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review"><em>TheStreet</em>'s Jacob Krol</a>:<blockquote>Thus far, it's clear that the anodization blocks most fingerprint smudges, and the M3 looks better than an M2 in the Midnight color. However, Midnight is a harder color to block all of them, as I am still seeing some, specifically on the top and bottom cases of the 15-inch. That being said, on the inside around the keyboard and on or off the trackpad, it does a really good job of stopping them.</blockquote><h3>Wi-Fi 6E</h3><br/>
The new MacBook Airs support Wi-Fi 6E for "up to twice as fast" wireless download speeds compared to the previous models with Wi-Fi 6, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible device and router. The entire current-generation Mac lineup now supports Wi-Fi 6E.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Microphone Upgrades</h3><br/>
Apple says the microphones in the new MacBook Air models offer "enhanced voice clarity in audio and video calls" compared to the previous models. The microphones also gained support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/block-background-noise-facetime-mac/">"Voice Isolation" and "Wide Spectrum" modes</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The European Commission has requested "further explanations" from Apple over its decision yesterday to <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account">terminate the developer account</a> of Epic Games, the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b0655af4-833e-4434-a6f4-5e198f914537">Financial Times</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
The EC said it was investigating under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a new law aimed at curbing the power of the biggest online platforms. Tech companies faced a March 7 deadline to comply with the legislation. The Commission added that it was also evaluating whether Apple's actions might have breached other EU laws. <br/>
<br/>
Apple on Wednesday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/apple-explains-terminating-epic-games-account/">announced</a> the termination of Epic Games Sweden's developer account on a global scale, citing the game developer's recurrent untrustworthy actions. Apple said courts had previously granted Apple the authority to end the accounts of any of Epic's subsidiaries due to contractual infractions.<br/>
<br/>
The move thwarted Epic's plan to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/epic-games-store-ios-eu/">launch an Epic Games Store on iOS in the EU</a> and bring its Fortnite game back to the iPhone, which it claimed was in line with new EU regulations allowing for alternative app marketplaces on iOS. Starting with iOS 17.4, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">allows alternative app marketplaces on the iPhone in the EU</a>, as part of its compliance with the DMA. Epic argues that Apple's account termination violates the DMA and significantly limits competition on iOS devices.<br/>
<br/>
Epic condemned Apple's decision as a violation of competitive principles, interpreting it as evidence of Apple's unwillingness to allow legitimate competition on its platform. The company claimed Apple's action was an attempt to eliminate a major potential rival to the App Store.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's action was the latest in a broader legal conflict that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">started in 2020</a> when Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store for bypassing its payment system rules. In retaliation, Epic launched lawsuits in the U.S. and Australia, accusing Apple of anti-competitive behavior. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/eu-probes-apple-termination-epic-account/">EU Probes Apple&#039;s Decision to Shut Down Epic&#039;s Developer Account</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-probes-apples-decision-to-shut-down-epics-developer-account.2421267/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to release a 20-inch MacBook with a foldable screen in around three years, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
"Apple's only foldable product with a clear development schedule is the 20.3-inch MacBook, expected to enter mass production in 2027," said Kuo, <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1765563986089783322">in a post on X today</a>. He did not provide any additional details about the device.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo is the third source to mention the possibility of a 20-inch MacBook, alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/31/apple-foldable-notebook-2025/">display industry analyst Ross Young</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-20-inch-display-future-macbook-pro/">Korean website <em>The Elec</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
The largest laptop that Apple currently sells is the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The company also once offered a 17-inch MacBook Pro, which was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2012/06/11/apple-quietly-discontinues-macbook-pro-17/">discontinued in 2012</a>. The new foldable MacBook would have a screen that measures around 20 inches diagonally when fully expanded, but Kuo did not provide any details about the device's exact design.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the 20-inch MacBook is Apple's only foldable product with a clear development schedule, suggesting that a foldable iPhone or iPad are not coming any time soon.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/">Foldable MacBook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/20-inch-macbook-kuo/">Kuo: Apple Planning 20-Inch MacBook With Foldable Screen</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-planning-20-inch-macbook-with-foldable-screen.2421253/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Drake Bennett today published an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-03-06/apple-car-s-crash-design-details-tim-cook-s-indecision-failed-tesla-deal">in-depth report</a> examining Apple's decade-long attempt at creating an electric vehicle. The project was reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">canceled last week</a> after many challenges and setbacks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/Apple-car-wheel-icon-Kevin-Lynch-feature-blue-revamp.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839900" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple vice president Kevin Lynch, who oversaw the electric vehicle project in its later years</em></div><br/>
The report described a 2020 prototype of Apple's electric vehicle:<blockquote>The prototype, a white minivan with rounded sides, an all-glass roof, sliding doors and whitewall tires, was designed to comfortably seat four people and inspired by the classic flower-power Volkswagen microbus. The design was referred to within Apple, not always affectionately, as the Bread Loaf. The plan was for the vehicle to hit the market some five years later with a giant TV screen, a powerful audio system and windows that adjusted their own tint. The cabin would have club seating like a private plane, and passengers would be able to turn some of the seats into recliners and footrests.</blockquote>Apple once considered acquiring Tesla to bolster its efforts, the report said:<blockquote>But before sketching out its own designs, Apple considered acquiring Tesla. At that point the electric-car maker's success was far from assured, and its value was less than &#36;30 billion, or a 20th of what it is today. Adrian Perica, Apple's head of corporate development, held a series of meetings with Elon Musk. But Cook, who'd succeeded Jobs three years earlier, shut the deal down while negotiations were still at an early stage.</blockquote>Apple also considered partnering with or acquiring Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Ford, Volkswagen, McLaren, and other automakers, according to the report:<blockquote>Talks with Mercedes-Benz progressed further. For a few months, Apple and the German automaker actively worked on a partnership similar to the Tesla idea, but with a twist. Mercedes would manufacture Apple's vehicle, while it would also sell its own cars with Apple's self-driving platform and user interface. Apple eventually pulled out, in part because the early work gave its executives confidence they could build a car on their own, people involved in the failed deal say.</blockquote>The project was ultimately a "failure" due to indecision, the report said:<blockquote>But Apple never got close to realizing its original vision, or any of its subsequent ones. It didn't get as far as testing a full-scale prototype on public roads. That it didn't is partly thanks to the enormous technical difficulty of its self-driving goals, as well as the punishing economics of the automaking business. The project was also a failure, at the highest levels of the company, to settle on one thing and do it.</blockquote>The report detailed how Apple's COO Jeff Williams and Apple Car chief Kevin Lynch broke the  news of the project's cancellation to employees:<blockquote>The meeting lasted about 12 minutes. Both men thanked the staffers for their work and got straight to the reorg and layoffs. Some employees would immediately get shifted to Apple's AI division, and some would move over to software engineering. A chunk of the team, though, was immediately without a job. Hardware engineers would have the opportunity to apply for roles in other groups, but there aren't spots for everyone. Other employees, such as the hundreds of car-specific engineers, test track technicians, self-driving car testers and automotive safety experts, received emails with their severance packages. As for the Arizona track, Apple is already working to sell it.</blockquote>Other notable details mentioned in the report include that Steve Jobs was apparently first to raise the idea of Apple building a vehicle, and that some Apple employees received a tour of Jay Leno's garage and his car collection early on.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 190 includes fixes and updates for CSS, History, HTML, JavaScript, Media, Networking, SVG, URLs, Web API, and Web Inspector.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Belkin this week released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/belkin-iphone-magsafe-mount-for-apple-tv/">new iPhone Mount with MagSafe</a>, which is designed to attach to a television for use with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> Mount lets you use your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as a camera for your &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Belkin iPhone MagSafe Stand" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MdByMW-lVX0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Apple actually showed off this mount when it introduced &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, but it hasn't been available for purchase until now, and there hasn't been an official solution for mounting an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to a television set.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HR1V2ZM/A/belkin-iphone-mount-with-magsafe-for-apple-tv-4k">Priced at &#36;49.95</a>, the Belkin &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mount has a bracket that is able to attach to a TV or a display that's up to four inches thick, or it can be used with a pedestal as a standalone mount next to a TV.<br/>
<br/>
It's super simple to use the mount, and you just need to pop it on the TV and then stick your MagSafe-enabled &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the mount. You can adjust the tilt from -20 to +30 degrees for the perfect filming angle, and it works in either portrait or landscape mode.<br/>
<br/>
We tested the mount with &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;, but it is also compatible with any Continuity Camera-supported apps. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; activates automatically as the camera in &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; or another supported app, and all you need to do is be signed in with the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> on both devices.<br/>
<br/>
Note that using an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as a camera for an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; requires the second-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K or later with tvOS 17, and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>) running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or later.<br/>
<br/>
Using a TV for &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; is great if you're FaceTiming with multiple people or for SharePlay sessions, and there are options to set up a split-screen layout when using &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today said it has <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account">terminated Epic Games Sweden's developer account</a> worldwide due to the game developer's pattern of untrustworthy behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/app-store-blue-banner-epic-1.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800065" /><br/>
Apple shared the following statement with <em>MacRumors</em>:<blockquote>Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate "any or all of Epic Games' wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games' control at any time and at Apple's sole discretion." In light of Epic's past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.</blockquote>In a letter sent to Epic, lawyers representing Apple said that Epic has proven to be "verifiably untrustworthy." Apple said it cannot be assured that Epic will follow the Apple Developer Program's terms and conditions in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Epic said that it had intended to use the Swedish account to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/epic-games-store-ios-eu/">launch an Epic Games Store on iOS</a> in the EU, and this would have brought the Fortnite app back to the iPhone. Starting with iOS 17.4, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">allows alternative app marketplaces</a> on the iPhone in the EU, as part of its compliance with the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
In a press release, Epic said that Apple terminating the Swedish developer account is a "serious violation" of the Digital Markets Act, and "shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices." <br/>
<br/>
More from Epic's response:<blockquote>In terminating Epic's developer account, Apple is taking out one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store. They are undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices.</blockquote>Epic believes that Apple suspended its Swedish developer account in part due to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney's public criticism of Apple's proposed Digital Markets Act compliance plans. Epic shared a letter it received from the App Store's chief Phil Schiller, who indeed said that Sweeney's "colorful criticism" of Apple's plans, but also Epic's history of "intentionally violating contractual provisions with which it disagrees," strongly suggest that Epic does not intend to follow the Apple Developer Program rules if reinstated.<br/>
<br/>
The legal battle between the two companies <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">began in 2020</a>, after Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store on the iPhone due to Epic introducing a direct payment option in the app for the in-game currency V-Bucks, in defiance of the App Store rules. In what appears to have been an orchestrated move, Epic promptly filed a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of anti-competitive behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Apple had already terminated one of Epic's other developer accounts in 2020 after the company violated the App Store's rules with its Fortnite stunt.<br/>
<br/>
Epic continues to litigate against Apple in both the U.S. and Australia, and it appears that the highly-publicized legal battle is far from over.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/apple-explains-terminating-epic-games-account/">Apple Explains Why It Terminated Epic&#039;s Latest Developer Account</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-why-it-terminated-epics-latest-developer-account.2421220/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Despite now being similar in appearance, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and the MacBook Pro are very different devices, so should you consider purchasing the 13- or 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, which start at &#36;999, to save money, or do you need one of the higher-end 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro models, which cost at least &#36;600 more? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two popular Apple silicon machines is best for you.<br/>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
Both the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro share the same basic design with a flat top and rounded edges on the bottom, but they do have several minor details that differ. For example, while both MacBooks have displays with a "notch" at the top to facilitate the built-in webcam, the MacBook Pro's bezels are noticeably slimmer. The keyboard area of the high-end MacBook Pro is also all-black.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/macbook-air-design.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="912" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-850089" /><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and M3 version of the MacBook Pro are available in Silver and Space Gray, but the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is also offered in Starlight and Midnight color options, so if you are looking for a particular aesthetic with one of these finishes, you will need to get the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. Space Black is exclusive to the MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips.<br/>

</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Dimensions are also a key area of difference between the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is considerably larger and heavier than the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, but it is important to not understate the difference between the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. While the 14-inch MacBook Pro offers a larger display than the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, its marginally larger footprint, added thickness, and an additional 0.8 pounds of weight do make for a noticeably less portable machine if you prefer to travel light.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, the 14-inch MacBook Pro offers a very good balance of portability and performance, so if you need its added capabilities, its size and weight should not hold you back. The 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; also provides a good balance of portability and display area, but users wary of its size should opt for the 13-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="ports_and_connectivity">Ports and Connectivity</h3><br/>
The selection of ports is an area of major difference between the two machines. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; features just two Thunderbolt ports, while the M3 version of the MacBook Pro adds an HDMI 2.1 port and SDXC card slot. When configured with the M3 Pro or M3 Max, the MacBook Pro has a total of three Thunderbolt 4 ports, in addition to its HDMI 2.1 port and SDXC card slot. Both machines feature a 3.5mm headphone jack with support for high-impedance headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/2021-macbook-pro-ports.jpg" alt="" width="1952" height="1156" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821474" /><br/>
All in all, the MacBook Pro is much more versatile in terms of physical connectivity, offering useful features for professionals who use SDXC cards from digital cameras or even simply more USB peripherals.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="display_size">Display Size</h3><br/>
The smaller &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s display is 13.6 inches in size, which is a little smaller than the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro, and markedly smaller than the 16.2-inch MacBook Pro. 13.6 inches is still bigger than the largest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> model, which comes in at 12.9 inches, and even all of the previous &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and smaller MacBook Pro models, meaning that it should be adequate for most users. The 14.2-inch MacBook Pro simply offers a little bit more screen real estate to those who need high-end capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
The 15.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and 16.2-inch MacBook Pro's displays will be better replacements for a desktop machine and provide much more screen space to arrange multiple windows and use professional applications that benefit from additional display area.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="display_technology">Display Technology</h3><br/>
The display technologies of both machines are significantly different. Like most MacBooks in recent years, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has an LCD panel, but owing to its slim bezels and rounded corners, Apple calls it a Liquid Retina display. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models feature Apple's more advanced mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR technology for deeper blacks, better dynamic range, and improved color accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-display.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821240" /><br/>
The XDR display can get much brighter, reaching as high as 1,600 nits of brightness at its peak when showing HDR content. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models also have ProMotion displays, allowing them to vary their refresh rate up to 120Hz. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; does not have a display with a variable refresh rate.<br/>
<br/>
It will be worth getting the high-end MacBook Pro models for viewing and editing HDR content, as well as watching high-framerate video such as sports. The display of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is sufficient for most users and some may not even notice a drastic difference. The MacBook Pro's deeper blacks and smoother on-screen motion simply offer a slightly better experience.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="chips">Chips</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; contains the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; or M3 chip, while MacBook Pro customers can choose between the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips. The M3 Pro and M3 Max are scaled-up versions of the M3 chip that offer additional CPU and GPU cores. See the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max's Geekbench 5 Benchmark scores below:<br/>

<br/>
The M3 Pro and M3 Max provide CPUs with up to eight additional cores and GPUs with up to 30 additional cores. The entry-level &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip is only slightly less powerful than the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max in single-core tasks, but the M3 chips, and particularly the Pro and Max versions, are considerably better in multi-core and graphics tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Apple-M3-chip-series-architecture.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920045" /><br/>
With significantly more transistors, performance CPU cores, and GPU cores, the M3 Pro and M3 Max are powerful chips designed for professionals with demanding workflows. The &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3, on the other hand, are more consumer-oriented chips focused on delivering surprisingly impressive performance and excellent efficiency to keep temperatures down and prolong battery life.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is passively cooled and contains no fan, which can slightly constrain peak performance compared to the MacBook Pro, since the high-end machines have large fans to actively cool the system and push the chips harder.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; only supports a single external display. The limitations of the M3 also mean that &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro devices configured with this chip support up to two external displays when the lid is closed, whereas M3 Pro and M3 Max machines support up to two and four external displays, respectively. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="memory_and_storage">Memory and Storage</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; can be configured with up to 24GB of unified memory and up to 2TB of storage, which should be more than enough for the vast majority of users. For those who need even more memory and storage, the MacBook Pro can be configured with significantly more memory and storage than the top-spec &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 Pro and M3 Max chips in the MacBook Pro also provide up to 150GB/s and 400GB/s memory bandwidth respectively – an enormous increase over the 100GB/s memory bandwidth with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 models.<br/>
<br/>
Buyers should also be aware that the 256GB &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; base models have up to 50 percent slower SSDs than configurations with more storage. This is because the base models only have a single SSD module inside, whereas models with larger amounts of storage have two SSD chips, significantly increasing the overall speed of the machine's storage.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="speakers_and_microphones">Speakers and Microphones</h3><br/>
The 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has a four-speaker sound system that is surprisingly full and balanced for such a small, slim device. The 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and all of the MacBook Pro models take things to the next level with a six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers for dramatically bigger and deeper audio. Apple also describes the MacBook Pro's speaker system as "high-fidelity," which may be invaluable to users who work in professional audio production or simply listen to a lot of music out-loud.<br/>
<br/>

The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has a three-mic array with directional beamforming that is perfect for activities like video calls and voice notes. The MacBook Pro has what Apple calls a "studio-quality" three-mic array with high signal-to-noise ratio and directional beamforming. While they are not as good as a dedicated microphone, the MacBook Pro's microphones are impressive and, at a push, are suitable for production purposes like podcasting.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="battery_life">Battery Life</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has an 18-hour battery life, offering the same battery life as the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro or M3 Max chips, and four hours less than the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip and the 16-inch MacBook Pro. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><br/>
Overall, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is the best option for casual users, offering an excellent balance of features and performance in a highly portable design. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s &#36;999 starting price is much more affordable compared to the MacBook Pro, and with an education discount or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#macbook_air">offer from our Apple Deals Roundup</a>, it is possible to get that price down by at least &#36;100. The additional &#36;600 to get the MacBook Pro likely is not worth it for most ordinary users, and on the contrary, many will prefer the slimmer, lighter design of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and perhaps even its additional color options.<br/>
<br/>

Professionals who require larger and more accurate displays, additional ports, more memory and storage, and a very high level of performance should look to the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, and the higher price points of these machines reflects this. The high-end MacBook Pro models are not targeted at everyday consumers, being clearly tailored to creatives and professionals who rely heavily on the capabilities of their machines. As such, these high-end models should only be a go-to option if you are a power-user or professional who can make use of its advanced features. The 16-inch MacBook Pro, in particular, is also potentially a good desktop replacement machine due to its large display.<br/>

Alternatively, if you are considering the &#36;1,299 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, it may be worth paying more to get the M3 MacBook Pro. For just &#36;200 more, the M3 MacBook Pro offers a considerably better Liquid Retina XDR display with ProMotion, a more powerful chip with active cooling, four extra hours of battery life, better speakers and microphones, an HDMI port and SDXC card slot, and more. In fact, if you configure the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with 512GB of storage to match the M3 MacBook Pro, there is only a &#36;100 between the two machines, so in this instance it is almost always worth getting the more powerful machine, unless maximizing screen size is your only priority.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro/">MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 30+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-buyers-guide-30-differences-compared.2378980/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today adjusted its estimated <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in">trade-in values</a> for select iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch models in the U.S., with the changes reflected on its website.<br/>

Apple slightly increased trade-in values for the iPhone 14 Pro Max, second-generation iPhone SE, Apple Watch Series 4, and first-generation Apple Watch SE, while trade-in values slightly decreased for the entry-level iPad, Apple Watch Ultra, Apple Watch Series 7, and second-generation Apple Watch SE.<br/>
