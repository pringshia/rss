		<description><![CDATA[Do you find yourself frequently scrolling through multiple Home Screen pages on your iPhone to get to the apps you access most often? If so, chances are you've already filled up the first page with some of your favorite apps. But what if you could automatically make all of your most-used apps appear on page one? With the Siri Suggestions widget, you can.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/siri-suggested-apps-iphone-home-screen.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959800" /><br/>
The Siri Suggestions widget intelligently recommends apps based on your usage patterns. By populating your Home Screen with multiple instances of this widget, you can ensure that the apps you need most are always just a tap away. Read on to learn how it's done.<br/>
<ol><br/>
    <li>With your iPhone unlocked, swipe to a Home Screen page with at least two free rows available.</li><br/>
    <li>Press and hold the empty space on the Home Screen until the apps start to jiggle.</li><br/>
    <li>Tap the "<strong>+</strong>" button in the top-left corner of the screen to access the widget gallery.</li><br/>
    <li>Search for "Siri Suggestions" in the widget gallery or scroll through the list to find it.</li><br/>
    <li>Tap the Siri Suggestions widget option, then choose the first option showing two rows of apps by tapping <strong>Add Widget</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/1siri-suggested-apps-home-screen.jpg" alt="siri suggestions" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959818" /><br/>
    <li>Drag the widget to a fresh new page containing no other apps.</li><br/>
    <li>Add another instance of the Siri Suggestions widget by tapping the "+" button in the top-left corner of the screen again, then selecting it in the widget gallery, just like you did for the first one.</li><br/>
   <li>Add a third Siri Suggestions widget in the same way.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/siri-suggestions-home-screen-apps.jpg" alt="siri suggestions" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959829" /><br/>
    <li>Next, tap the row of dots representing your ‌Home Screen‌ pages.</li><br/>
    <li>In the ‌Home Screen‌ grid that appears, touch and drag the page of widgets you just made and move it so that it's the first Home Screen page (the one you see when you unlock your iPhone). The others will move to make way in response to your drag action.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top-right corner of the screen when you're happy with the new arrangement, then tap <strong>Done</strong> again to exit jiggle mode.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/move-home-screen-pages.jpg" alt="Home Screen pages" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959822" /></ol>Don't worry if the widgets first show the same suggested apps as each other – this will correct itself when you swipe away from the page and return to it. That's all there is to it. By following the above steps, you will have quick access to your most-used apps, even if your habits change, ensuring your Home Screen is both dynamic and tailored to your needs.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/siri-suggested-apps-widget-home-screen/">Auto-Populate iPhone Home Screen With Your Most Used Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/auto-populate-iphone-home-screen-with-your-most-used-apps.2432201/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's User Privacy Engineering Manager Katie Skinner and Privacy Product Marketing Lead Sandy Parakilas recently sat down with YouTuber Andru Edwards for a wide-ranging discussion on Apple's privacy policies.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Talking Privacy with Apple - Are Your Secrets Safe?" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YOi0r3vptQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Topics covered include Apple's approach to privacy, the ways Apple contends with privacy laws in different countries, and how Apple deals with government requests, plus there's a good deal of information on the new features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Some of what's discussed covers privacy information that Apple has reiterated over and over again, but there are some interesting tidbits on Apple's adoption of ChatGPT, Maps privacy, the Passwords app, and accessory pairing in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
It's a long discussion at almost 45 minutes, but worth it for those who want a bit more insight into Apple's philosophy on privacy.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-privacy-team-interview-ios-18/">Apple&#039;s Privacy Team Does Deep Dive Into iOS 18 Privacy Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-privacy-team-does-deep-dive-into-ios-18-privacy-features.2432174/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

"We're thrilled the SEC, ACC, and Big Ten are utilizing iPad, as its unique capabilities and versatility make it the ideal solution to support coaches and student-athletes," said Scott Brodrick, an iPad product marketing employee at Apple. "With an unrivaled combination of advanced displays, powerful performance, portability, fast connectivity, all-day battery life and versatile accessories, iPad will let coaches and players make in-game adjustments and empower athletes to compete at the highest level."<br/>
<br/>
The introduction of iPads is a result of upcoming NCAA rule changes that allow for video replay technology to be used on the sidelines of college football games, for the first time.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is rumored to have been working on its own 5G modem for iPhones since 2018, but the project has reportedly faced numerous <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/28/apple-5g-modem-failed-qualcomm-remains-supplier/">challenges and delays</a>. At last, however, the project may be finally getting closer to completion.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/5G-Modem-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886940" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1816132182039232624">short article</a> posted on social media platform X today, well-known Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said two iPhone models with an Apple-designed 5G modem will be released in 2025, including a fourth-generation iPhone SE in the first quarter of the year and an all-new, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">ultra-thin iPhone 17 model</a> in the third quarter.<br/>
<br/>
All existing iPhones that are currently sold by Apple are equipped with Qualcomm modems for cellular connectivity. Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/">extended its 5G modem supply agreement with Qualcomm</a> for iPhone launches through 2026, so Apple's transition to its own in-house 5G chips will likely be gradual over multiple years.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/">acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> in 2019, as part of its efforts to design its own 5G chip. It is unclear if Apple's chip would have any consumer benefits over Qualcomm's modems, but it would reduce Apple's reliance on Qualcomm. In 2017, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/20/apple-qualcomm-1-billion-lawsuit/">Apple sued Qualcomm</a> over alleged anticompetitive practices and &#36;1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates. The two companies <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/">settled the lawsuit</a> in 2019.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">Kuo: iPhone SE 4 and Ultra-Thin iPhone 17 to Use Apple&#039;s Own 5G Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-se-4-and-ultra-thin-iphone-17-to-use-apples-own-5g-chip.2432157/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/07/apple-maps-on-the-web-launches-in-beta/">today announced</a> that it has launched <a href="http://beta.maps.apple.com/">an Apple Maps on the web feature</a>, which is available in a public beta capacity. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> for the web works in Safari and other web browsers, allowing users to get directions without having to open up the Maps app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/apple-maps-on-web.jpg" alt="" width="2496" height="1404" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959915" /><br/>
&zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; on the web works like the &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; app, so users can get driving and walking directions, find places to visit, view ratings and hours, and browse curated Guides. There are also features for ordering food directly from the Maps place card and discovering places to eat, shop, and explore in cities around the world. Apple says that additional options like Look Around will be introduced in the coming months. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; on the web will serve as an alternative to Google Maps, which has long been the most popular web-based mapping option. You can check out &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; on the web <a href="http://beta.maps.apple.com/">on Apple's Maps.Apple.com website</a>. Developers are able to link out to Maps on the web in their apps, so users can get driving directions and see location information.<br/>
<br/>
Maps on the web is available in English at the current time, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120585">it works with</a> Safari and Chrome on Mac and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Chrome and Edge on Windows PCs. Apple plans to add support for additional languages, browsers, and platforms over time. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-maps-now-available-on-the-web/">Apple Maps Now Available on the Web</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-now-available-on-the-web.2432149/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Intelligence Features Still Coming in Later iOS 18 Developer Beta</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/#apple_intelligence">Apple Intelligence</a> is still not available as of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-4/">fourth developer beta of iOS 18</a> this week, leading some to wonder if the features have been delayed. However, we have confirmed that Apple still plans to add some of the new Apple Intelligence features to an upcoming beta this summer. In other words, developers will be able to test the first Apple Intelligence features at some point before iOS 18 is widely released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
Given that public betas of iOS are based on developer betas, Apple Intelligence will likely be added in an upcoming iOS 18 public beta version as well.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in mid-June removed the "this summer" timeframe that initially appeared at the bottom of its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence page for developers</a>, but as we stated above, there is no change in plans from what Apple announced at WWDC. The features will likely be added before the end of August, ahead of iOS 18 being widely released in September.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features will be available in U.S. English only at launch, and they will require an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max. The features will also be available on Mac and iPad models equipped with an M1 chip or newer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence will be able to summarize text, prioritize notifications and emails, and generate custom emoji and images, while the technology will also power a smarter version of Siri with richer language understanding, deeper per-app controls, on-screen awareness, and more. Apple said some of the features, along with support for additional languages and software platforms, will be added "over the course of the next year."<br/>
<br/>
Even when iOS 18 is widely released in September, Apple said some of the Apple Intelligence features will still be considered a "preview" for all users. The full rollout of Apple Intelligence on the iPhone is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/">expected to be completed in 2025</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-intelligence-coming-in-later-ios-18-dev-beta/">Apple Intelligence Features Still Coming in Later iOS 18 Developer Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-features-still-coming-in-later-ios-18-developer-beta.2432148/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> update to its public beta testing group, giving the general public a chance to try out the new operating system's features ahead of its fall launch. The second public beta comes a bit over a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-releases-macos-sequoia-public-beta/">release of the first beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-iphone-mirroring.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956750" /><br/>
Public beta testers can download &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; from the Software Update section of the System Settings app after <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">signing up on Apple's beta testing website</a> and opting into the public beta under the Beta Updates section.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;'s biggest feature is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, which is designed to let you control your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from your Mac using your keyboard and mouse. You can see notifications and use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps even when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is tucked away and locked, and later this year, you'll be able to use the feature to drag and drop apps from your Mac to your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
Window tiling has been improved to make it easier to get multiple windows on your Mac in a way that works for you, Safari can summarize websites and show you highlights, and the Messages app supports scheduling messages and using the Tapback feature with any emoji.<br/>
<br/>
There's a new Passwords app for managing your passwords, logins, and passkeys, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app has a new design, the Notes app supports audio transcription and summarization, and you can also type in any equation and get it solved automatically.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a> to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to give the new features a try ahead of when the software launches this fall. The second beta comes a week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/watchos-11-public-beta/">after the first beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957264" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchos-11-vitals.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; can be downloaded after signing up on <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">Apple's beta software website</a> and upgrading your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to the public beta version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. You'll need to open up the Watch app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, go to General, select Software Update, and choose the &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; Public Beta option under Beta Updates.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj;, Apple added a new Vitals app that can be used to give you a daily overview of your health metrics, letting you know if anything is out of the ordinary. It compares information collected at night like heart rate, sleep, respiratory rate, and oxygen level to your levels over the previous weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Smart Stack has new widgets like Translate and Shazam, plus it's smarter because it is able to suggest widgets based on time, date, location, and daily routine. Interactive widgets let you access app features from the Smart Stack, and it also supports Live Activities.<br/>
<br/>
Training Load is a new way of measuring how the intensity and duration of workouts impact the body over time, with Apple providing an effort level for cardio-based workouts to help you know when to rest and when to push harder.<br/>
<br/>
You can now customize your Activity Ring requirements for different days of the week, and Apple added support for rest days. Taking a break from activity will no longer ruin a streak because you can pause for a day, a week, a month, or more.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include more workout types, Check In for Messages, a revamped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> watch face, improvements to Double Tap, and more, with additional information <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">available in our watchOS 11 roundup</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-releases-watchos-11-public-beta-2/">Apple Releases Second watchOS 11 Public Beta With Vitals App and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-second-watchos-11-public-beta-with-vitals-app-and-more.2432141/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second public beta of tvOS 18, giving the general public a chance to try out the new features ahead of the software's fall launch. The second beta comes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-seeds-first-tvos-18-public-beta/">a week after the first</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-796083" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-design-triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Public beta testers can download the tvOS 18 beta by opening up the Settings app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, choosing the Software Updates section under System, and then toggling on the Get Public Beta Updates option. Signing up on <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">Apple's public beta website</a> is required to get the option to show up.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 18 isn't as feature rich as some of Apple's other updates, but it brings a new InSight feature to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app. InSight is similar to Amazon X-Ray, providing real-time information about actors, music, and more in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> shows and movies.<br/>
<br/>
The Enhanced Dialogue feature uses computational audio and machine learning to better boost vocal clarity over background noise and music, plus it works with built-in TV speakers, AirPods, and other Bluetooth devices. Subtitles have been tweaked to show up automatically when relevant, such as when the TV is muted.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added new screen savers and made it easier to swap between them, plus there's 21:9 aspect ratio support for projectors and an option for Live Captions during <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 18 is limited to public beta testers and developers right now, but it will see a public launch this fall.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/%E9%97%9C%E6%96%BC2h25%E6%96%B0%E6%AC%BEiphone-17%E7%94%A2%E5%93%81%E7%B5%84%E5%90%88%E8%88%87%E8%B6%85%E8%96%84iphone-17%E7%9A%84%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC%E8%88%87%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90-predictions-and-analysis-of-the-2h25-new-iphone-17-1528d0772610">shared alleged specifications</a> for a new ultra-thin iPhone 17 model rumored to launch next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Generic-iPhone-17-Feature-With-Full-Width-Dynamic-Island.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959827" /><br/>
Kuo expects the device to be equipped with a 6.6-inch display with a current-size Dynamic Island, a standard A19 chip rather than an A19 Pro chip, a single rear camera, and an Apple-designed 5G chip. He also expects the device to have a titanium-aluminum frame, but with a lower percentage of titanium than used for iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
The analyst added that while there will not be an iPhone 17 Plus, the new ultra-thin model will not be a replacement for it. Instead, he said the device will be an all-new model, with its main selling point to be its "new design" rather than specs.<br/>
<br/>
With no A19 Pro chip, a single camera, a slightly smaller display than the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and a focus on design over specifications, it sounds like the ultra-thin model will not be the so-called highest-end "iPhone 17 Ultra" after all. It is now unclear exactly where the device will be positioned in the iPhone 17 lineup, but that will likely become clearer as it gets closer to launching. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 series in September 2025, so there is still a lot of runway for more rumors.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">Kuo: Ultra-Thin iPhone 17 to Feature A19 Chip, Single Rear Camera, Semi-Titanium Frame, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-to-feature-a19-chip-single-rear-camera-semi-titanium-frame-and-more.2432134/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Taiwanese research firm TrendForce this week <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240722-12228.html">said</a> it anticipates that Apple will begin releasing iPhones with quad-level cell (QLC) storage by 2026. This technology could pave the way for iPhones with 2TB of storage in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature-White.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911430" /><br/>
QLC is a denser storage technology compared to the triple-level cell (TLC) technology used for storage chips in existing iPhones, and this would allow for higher storage capacity within the same physical footprint. In addition, QLC storage is typically less expensive than TLC in terms of price per gigabyte. However, one downside is that QLC storage typically offers slower read and write speeds compared to TLC storage.<br/>
<br/>
The density and cost advantages of QLC could pave the way for Apple to release a 2TB storage capacity for future iPhones. TrendForce's estimate that Apple will adopt the technology by 2026 means that it could be incorporated into iPhones starting with iPhone 16 models, iPhone 17 models, or iPhone 18 models, so there is still no exact timeframe for this change. A report from supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em> earlier this year claimed that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/1tb-iphone-16-pro-could-face-performance-setback/">evaluating QLC for 1TB models</a> of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, so the technology could end up being used for both 1TB and 2TB storage capacities.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 16 series in September, so we are only a few months away from finding out whether a 2TB storage capacity and QLC storage technology are introduced this year or further into the future.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/">TrendForce</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/iphone-qlc-storage-rumor/">Apple Expected to Adopt Technology That May Pave Way for 2TB iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expected-to-adopt-technology-that-may-pave-way-for-2tb-iphones.2432132/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple stands to benefit significantly from India's recent reduction in import duties on mobile phones and components, aimed at boosting local manufacturing and making high-end smartphones more affordable (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-budget-india-cuts-import-tax-smartphones-boost-apple-2024-07-23/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Apple-BKC-Mumbai-India-media-preview-hero.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-892713" /><br/>
India has announced a 5% cut in import duties on mobile phones, printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs), and mobile device chargers, reducing the rate from 20% to 15%. The move is expected to save Apple &#36;35–50 million annually and supports the company's efforts to increase its manufacturing presence in India. Apple's assembly operations in the country, conducted through its partners like Foxconn, have grown significantly in recent years, with 14% of all iPhones now being produced in India. Foxconn has recently invested in new manufacturing plants in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, further boosting production capacity.<br/>
<br/>
The reduction in import duties is part of India's broader strategy to enhance its role in the global supply chain, particularly in the electronics sector. Apple continues to import a significant number of its premium models, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, into India. The reduced import duties will make these high-end models more affordable for Indian consumers. <br/>
<br/>
The country's official economic survey for 2024 also highlights the positive impact of initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and the Districts as Export Hubs (DEH) program. These programs have attracted substantial foreign investment, leading to increased local manufacturing capabilities.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/">Foxconn</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-expansion-in-india-to-accelerate/">Apple&#039;s Expansion in India Set to Accelerate Thanks to Duty Reductions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-expansion-in-india-set-to-accelerate-thanks-to-duty-reductions.2432130/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
Starting with the 8GB RAM/256GB SSD 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, you can get this model for <a href="https://howl.me/cmJGUyxasoz"><strong>&#36;1,049.00</strong></a> if you're a My Best Buy Plus/Total member, down from &#36;1,299.00.

<br/>
It's worth noting that even if you have to pay the &#36;49.99/year starting fee to join Best Buy's membership, today's MacBook Air deals are so steep you'll still come out paying around &#36;1,099.99 for the entry-level model, which is a match for the typical best price on the computer. The same goes for the other two models as well.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will feature the ability to create playlist artwork in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> using generative AI, beta code suggests.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Apple is seemingly preparing to introduce a new feature in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; that allows users to create customized playlist artwork in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; using Apple Intelligence. The feature, uncovered in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-4/">iOS 18 beta 4</a> code by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/23/apple-music-playlist-artwork-apple-intelligence/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>, will enable users to generate unique images tailored to their playlists using Image Playground.<br/>
<br/>
At the core of this new functionality is a new "Create Image" button, which users will see while editing their playlists. Once tapped, this button will invoke Image Playground, a tool showcased at WWDC earlier this year. Image Playground enables users to generate new images by inputting written commands. These AI-generated images can vary in appearance, offering animation, illustration, and sketch styles, though it does not support the creation of photorealistic images. Users can specify their preferences for the artwork, and &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; will produce several options that match the playlist's theme or content.<br/>
<br/>
Like other Apple Intelligence features, it is currently unavailable in the beta versions of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. Some Apple Intelligence features have been expected to be included in the summer beta releases, although these references were subsequently removed from Apple's website. According to a recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/new-siri-experience-to-debut-spring-2025/">report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, some of these AI features might not launch until 2025. Given that Apple Intelligence has not appeared as of the fourth developer beta, it is unclear how many of its features will make it into the iOS 18.0 release. &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is slated for release in the fall, with a beta preview already accessible to developers and public beta users.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/9to5mac-com/">9to5Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-intelligence-to-generate-playlist-artwork/">Apple Intelligence to Generate Playlist Artwork in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-to-generate-playlist-artwork-in-ios-18.2432123/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has released a new Environment for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, called Lake Vrangla, which is close to Oslo in Norway.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lake-vrangla-environment-vision-pro-1.jpg" alt="" width="1770" height="994" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959756" /><br/>
&zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;'s passthrough cameras are designed to show the wearer their physical surroundings, allowing them to place apps and other digital objects within the room. However, using the Digital Crown, users can switch to full virtual reality and block out the real world using a selection of Environments.<br/>
<br/>
The new Lake Vrangla Environment is available to all users as a simple download, which can be initiated from the Environments tab of the Home View, regardless of whether users are running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1 or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> beta.<br/>
<br/>
Like Mount Hood, the foggy new environment has a night version that offers a calming sunset scene, and any video viewed over the lake will reflect in the water.<br/>
<br/>
This release follows Apple's announcement that the Bora Bora Environment will be included in &zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; later this year. Its arrival will complete the current Environments menu, making all 13 listed options fulfilled and usable.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-vision-pro-lake-vrangla-environment/">Apple Vision Pro Gains New Lake Vrangla Environment</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-gains-new-lake-vrangla-environment.2432114/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone will adopt a new 1/2.6-inch 48MP Ultra Wide CMOS image sensor (CIS) made by Samsung as early as 2026, breaking Sony's years-long monopoly as Apple's CIS supplier, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/iphone_12_pro_sensor_shift.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1118" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764639" /><br/>
Writing in a brief report <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1816057976358330824">published on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Kuo said Samsung has already established a dedicated team within its ranks to work on the camera components with a view to specifically supplying Apple. <br/>
<br/>
For years now, Apple has exclusively sourced CIS for its iPhones from Sony. However, recent developments suggest a strategic shift away from the Japanese supplier due to concerns about reliability and Apple's need to integrate new technologies into its camera system.<br/>
<br/>
If the 2026 production roadmap goes to plan, Apple could be using Samsung-made image sensors in the camera system that features on its iPhone 18 series.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/2026-iphone-48mp-camera-sensor-samsung/">Kuo: 2026 iPhone to Use New Advanced Camera Sensor From Samsung</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2026-iphone-to-use-new-advanced-camera-sensor-from-samsung.2432111/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adobe today updated its Illustrator and Photoshop Creative Cloud apps, introducing a range of new features that streamline productivity. Many of the additions take advantage of generative AI and machine learning to save creators time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/adobe-photoshop-selection-brush-tool.jpg" alt="" width="1170" height="876" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959738" /><br/>
Photoshop has a <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/07/23/supercharge-core-creative-workflows-adobe-photoshops-latest-update">new Selection Brush Tool</a> for selecting areas by brushing over them without having to use the Quick Mask mode. The tool has opacity and hardness settings for feathered edges, allowing for more seamless selections.<br/>
<br/>
The Adjustment Brush Tool, which has been in beta, is also available. It allows for painting on adjustments to brightness, saturation, and more, with options for fine tuning selections. Photoshop's Generate Image text to image feature is also out of beta, and it can be used to generate dozens of ideas in minutes using a text prompt and/or reference images.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/photoshop-generate-image.jpg" alt="" width="1170" height="876" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959739" /><br/>
Other new Photoshop features include an improved Contextual Task Bar, support for bulleted and numbered lists, and an Enhance Detail option for Generative Fill.<br/>
<br/>
Adobe Illustrator has a Generative Shape Fill feature for filling shapes with detail and color. Adobe says that users can match the style and color of their own artwork to create multiple editable and scalable vector graphic options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/adobe-illustrator-generative-shape-fill.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959737" /><br/>
Text prompts are used to fill vector graphics for Generative Shape Fill, and there are options to add styles like 3D, geometric, or pixel art.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Breaking down new Generative Shape Fill (beta) in Illustrator w/ Paul Trani Adobe Creative Cloud" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwoKOvONq38" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Adobe improved the Text to Pattern feature in Illustrator, making it simpler to create, edit, and scale seamless vector patterns. Vector graphics that are generated using the feature are crisper, plus there are new UI controls and better editing options.<br/>
<br/>
With Mockup, designers can see their creations on objects like product packaging and apparel, with the tool automatically adjusting art to fit the edges of the object. Other new features in Illustrator include the Dimension tool for precise sizing, enhanced selection capabilities, and faster pan and zoom speeds.<br/>
<br/>
These new features are available in the latest versions of Illustrator and Photoshop on the desktop.

		<description><![CDATA[Shortly after the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max were released last September, some customers began to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">experience an issue with the devices overheating</a>. Apple eventually mitigated the problem <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">with an iOS 17 update</a>, but it might go a step further with the iPhone 16 models that are set to be released later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature-White.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911430" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone"><em>The Information</em> today</a> cited a source who said that iPhone 16 models will be equipped with a "larger graphite sheet" inside the chassis of the devices, to address potential overheating. This corroborates a rumor from last November that claimed iPhone 16 models would feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">improved thermal management system</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release the iPhone 16 series in September, so the devices should be just a few months away from launching.

		<description><![CDATA[Following nearly two years of rumors about a fourth-generation iPhone SE, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone"><em>The Information</em> today reported</a> that Apple suppliers are finally planning to begin ramping up mass production of the device in October of this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iPhone-SE-4-Vertical-Camera-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959379" /><br/>
If accurate, that timeframe would mean that the next iPhone SE would not be announced alongside the iPhone 16 series in September, as expected. Instead, the report speculates that the device could be released ahead of the Lunar New Year in January 2025. However,<br/>
all three existing iPhone SE models were announced in March over the years, so a March 2025 release seems quite possible too.<br/>
<br/>
Rumored features for the fourth-generation iPhone SE include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an Action button, and a USB-C port. The device is expected to be similar to the base iPhone 14, although reports said it would have only a single rear camera, and it might share the iPhone 16's rear-panel manufacturing process.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple released the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> today, introducing small changes to a number of features throughout the operating system. There are no big additions in this beta, but Apple is continuing to refine existing settings and design choices.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple plans to continue updating &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; over the next few months, with the update set to be released this fall. We've rounded up all of the changes that we've found in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta 4 so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>CarPlay Wallpapers</h2><br/>
Apple added new Light Mode and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a> wallpaper options for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, and the new wallpaper mirrors the wallpapers that have been added on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here are all 8 new CarPlay wallpapers in iOS 18 beta 4<br><br>Lightmode (1/2) <a href="https://t.co/KQGvubg9ym">pic.twitter.com/KQGvubg9ym</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1815816335957327895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<h2>Settings</h2><br/>
Apple has added a new way to access <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> settings in the Settings app. There's now an &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; option paired with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Game Center, and Wallet. &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; settings can still be accessed by tapping on your Apple Account and choosing &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; from that interface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-beta-4-icloud-setting.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959729" /><br/>
<h2>Camera Controls</h2><br/>
In the Camera section of the Settings app, there is a new "Controls Menu" option under Preserve Settings. The Controls Menu preserves the previously used camera tool when expanding the controls menu rather than showing the full list of camera control options when using the Camera app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-controls-menu.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959728" /><br/>
<h2>Hidden Folder</h2><br/>
Apple has changed the design of the Hidden folder in the App Library. Rather than showing an icon of an eye with a line through it, it is now blanked out app squares, which makes it stand out less.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-hidden-folder-change.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959727" /><br/>
<h2>Dark Mode/Light Mode Icons</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; and Light Mode icons are now appropriately synced to the Light and &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; settings on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when you use the "Automatic" setting under Customize. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-light-mode-dark-mode.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959726" /><br/>
With Automatic turned on, the icons now turn dark when &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; is activated and light when &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; is off. This wasn't working in prior betas.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Stocks Icon</h2><br/>
Apple tweaked the design of the Stocks app icon. The lines are subtler, and there is no longer a white haze over the bottom part of the icon.<br/>

<h2>iPhone Mirroring</h2><br/>
This is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> feature more than an &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; feature, but when using &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring with &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta 4, you can change the size of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; window on your Mac's display.<br/>

<h2>Control Center</h2><br/>
There's a new Control Center toggle for Bluetooth, but it is not yet working. Apple also added a Silent Mode/Mute toggle and an Accessibility Eye Mirroring option.<br/>
<br/>

The Open Music Control Center option has been removed.<br/>
<br/>
These changes are also applicable to the Lock Screen Controls.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AssistiveTouch</h2><br/>
There are new Type to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Apple Watch Mirroring options available for AssistiveTouch.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
There are additional references to Apple Intelligence features, which suggests Apple is continuing to prepare to implement Apple Intelligence in the beta in the not too distant future.<br/>
<br/>
