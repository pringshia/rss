		<description><![CDATA[Apple has announced that it will be opening a new retail store in the Hongdae neighborhood of Seoul, South Korea on Saturday, January 20 at 10 a.m. local time.

The wallpaper features an Apple logo in a colorful graffiti style, symbolizing the Hongdae area's artistic and youthful culture. As noted by Michael Steeber <a href="https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/p/a-true-mini-store">in his Tabletops newsletter</a>, the logo has "홍대" (Hongdae) hidden within it.<br/>
<br/>
The store will be located at 140 Yanghwa-ro, near Hongik University, and it will offer Genius Bar appointments and Today at Apple creative sessions.<br/>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/applerefurbishedgoodastwo-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2688" height="1512" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834223" /><blockquote>As Settlement Administrator for the matter, we're sending you this courtesy email to inform you that by January 9, 2024, you will receive a payment notification email that contains a link to claim your payment electronically. Once you receive that email, you will have until May 15, 2024, to claim your payment.</blockquote>Back in 2021, Apple agreed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/apple-refurbished-lawsuit-settlement/">pay &#36;95 million</a> to settle an AppleCare-related lawsuit that accused the company of violating U.S. law by providing customers with refurbished replacement devices instead of new devices when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> repairs were required.<br/>
<br/>
The settlement was approved in April 2022, and Apple sent out some payments <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/25/apple-class-action-refurbished-lawsuit-payments/">starting in August 2022</a>, but a new wave of emails went out to customers today. The lawsuit covered iPhones and iPads purchased between July 20, 2012 and September, 30, 2021 and replaced with a refurbished device.<br/>
<br/>
A second wave of payments that are being sent out to disburse remaining funds after the first payments were received. Only 31 percent of those eligible claimed the first payment, leaving money for a second payment. <br/>
<br/>
While Apple paid &#36;95 million to settle the lawsuit, the company admitted no wrongdoing and has denied that refurbished devices are inferior to new devices.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-refurbished-lawsuit-payments-january-2024/">Second Payment Emails for Refurbished Apple Device Class Action Lawsuit Going Out Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/second-payment-emails-for-refurbished-apple-device-class-action-lawsuit-going-out-tomorrow.2415789/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to start offering Vision Pro demonstrations at U.S. Apple retail stores on Friday, February 2, Apple said today in emails that are going out to select customers. February 2 is the official launch date of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset.<br/>
<br/>

The demo sessions will be available at Apple retail stores in the United States. Apple says that demo times will be offered through the weekend on a first-come, first-served basis, with signups to take place starting at 8:00 a.m. on February 2.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New information regarding Apple Vision Pro demos at Apple Stores<br><br>“Be one of the first to get a demo of Apple Vision Pro.

		<description><![CDATA[The annual CES event kicks off this week, and we sent <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera to hunt down cool new products and technologies that are being previewed this year. CES officially starts tomorrow, but Dan attended CES Unveiled last night, and was able to get an early look at devices from Samsung,<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="CES 2024: Insane New Tech from Samsung &amp; CES Unveiled!" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x8TuG7Or5y8" width="1673" height="807" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Samsung showed off new OLED TVs with an updated anti-reflective coating that makes them much better in bright rooms and with reflective lights, plus there was a new 8K projector and some very impressive transparent OLED screens.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung had a neat 2D/3D display that uses cameras and eye tracking to display content in 3D without the need for glasses, and Dan was also impressed with a customizable music frame that holds artwork but also serves as a speaker for a subtle surround sound system.<br/>
<br/>
At Unveiled, Dan checked out a pet-focused robot vacuum and mop combo from Narwhal, Belkin's Qi2 wireless chargers and StandDock Pro, a Keurig sort of device for ice cream, and some retro Mac power adapters from Sharge.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to watch the full video to see the products in action, and stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em> because we'll be sharing CES videos and articles for the next few days.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/ces-2024-day-1-recap/">CES 2024 Day 1: What&#039;s New From Samsung and CES Unveiled</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-day-1-whats-new-from-samsung-and-ces-unveiled.2415785/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The playlist provides songs from more than 50 artists that are set to "have a breakthrough year."<br/>
<br/>

The predictions playlist is an annual release from Shazam, and the 2024 list includes everything from French pop to contemporary gospel, with content from creators in 21 countries.<blockquote>Have you ever scanned your Shazam history and spotted a big star-someone you discovered months or years before they became a household name? Every day, the app gets millions of requests from users around the world who are curious about the artist behind a song. These Shazams come from all over-TikTok videos, car commercials, coffee shops, overhearing something in the wild-which makes it a powerful tool for predicting tomorrow's heavy hitters. This playlist features 50 emerging artists who, based on Shazam data reviewed by our editors, are poised to have a breakthrough year.</blockquote>Shazam highlighted five artists to keep a close eye on, including Nigerian singer-songwriter Bloody Civilian, hip-hop duo Flyana Boss, South African singer Kenya Grace, indie rock band The Last Dinner Party, and K-pop group RIIZE.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Clear is a to-do list app that was first launched in 2012, and while it has received few updates since that time, it has remained popular with users due to its easy-to-use design and simple layout.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Xw2dVlXzfE" title="Clear: It Had to Be You" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Impending, the team behind Clear, has been working on a major revamp for the last several months, and Clear 2 is launching today. Clear 2 has the same general design and function as the original app, but there are new gestures for more fluid list making, new color themes, an edge-to-edge design, updated fonts, quote packs, sound themes, app icon options, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Creating and managing lists in Clear has not changed. Tap anywhere to add an item to a list, and swipe to either check it off or delete it. A tap at the bottom of the app goes to a list overview, and a second bottom tap leads to personalization options, rewards, the shop, and an archive of completed items.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clear-app-night-theme.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929051" /><br/>
Users can have an unlimited number of lists and items on the list, and the simple design of the app puts the focus on what's upcoming. Items on the list can be dragged and dropped between lists, and a swipe and hold to the left allows a time and a date to be added. Screenshotting a list brings up a share sheet so you can share a text or image version of the contents with a friend.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clear-scene-beach.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1310" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929052" /><br/>
As with the original version of Clear, using the app unlocks collectibles like unique colors for lists, and just using the app will provide users with new themes and fonts to choose from. There are also haptics and sounds when checking items off, adding new items to the list, and using other app features.<br/>
<br/>
Clear is no longer a paid app and it is free to use, and Impending has a clever monetization strategy. There is an entirely optional store with themes, fonts, sound packs, and app icons that change on a daily basis. The cosmetic options available for purchase do not affect the core functionality of the app, but do offer unique customization options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clear-scene-ipod.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1310" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929053" /><br/>
Clear 2 can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for free, and those who have the existing version of Clear will get the update without having to redownload the app. [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clear-todos/id493136154">Direct Link</a>]<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/clear-to-do-app-revamp/">&#039;Clear&#039; To-Do App Gets Total Design Overhaul and New Feature Set</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/clear-to-do-app-gets-total-design-overhaul-and-new-feature-set.2415775/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Under cover of its Vision Pro headset launch date <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">announcement</a>, Apple has revealed that the external battery supports up to 2.5 hours of 2D video playback, half an hour more than it offers in "general use" on a single charge.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-battery-pack.jpg" alt="" width="1640" height="1060" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929544" /><br/>
Apple quietly updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">product page</a> for the device with the extra detail, qualifying its claim of 2.5 hours of "video playback" based on tests "in conjunction with an Environment, using 2D movie content purchased from the Apple TV app." Environments let users transform the space around them, and Cinema Environments can turn a room into a personal movie theater.<br/>
<br/>
The company defines "general use" as performing tasks that include video playback, internet browsing, spatial video capture, and FaceTime. <br/>
<br/>
This is the first time Apple has said anything about the Vision Pro's external battery pack being optimized to run for longer when watching 2D video content, with Apple previously saying only that the battery lasted two hours on a single charge. Apple also previously said the Vision Pro could be used indefinitely if the battery was itself plugged into an external power source, but that text has been removed from the Vision Pro product page.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says Vision Pro users will be able to watch movies and TV shows from Apple TV+, Disney+, Max, and other services on a screen that feels 100 feet wide with support for HDR content. Elsewhere, within the Apple TV app, users will be able to access more than 150 3D titles.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders of the Vision Pro start on Friday, January 19 and the device goes on sale in the United States on Friday, February 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-vision-pro-battery-life-video-playback/">Apple Vision Pro Battery Supports Up to 2.5 Hours of 2D Video Playback</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-battery-supports-up-to-2-5-hours-of-2d-video-playback.2415765/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has announced that its first earnings call of 2024 <a href="https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.aspx">will be held on February 1</a>, one day before the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">Vision Pro launches in the United States</a>.<br/>
<br/>

On the call, Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the company's earnings results for the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year. The executives will almost certainly provide some additional commentary about the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
A live audio stream of the call will be available on Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">Investor Relations page</a>, and a recording will be available later in the day for replay.<br/>
<br/>
The quarter ran from October 1 through December 30 of 2023. During this period, Apple released new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 series of chips, updated the iMac with the M3 chip, and debuted a lower-cost Apple Pencil with a USB-C port. Apple also expanded its online store to Chile during the quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not provided formal guidance since early 2020, but analysts expect the company to report quarterly revenue of around &#36;117.8 billion on average, according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis?p=AAPL">Yahoo Finance</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/02/apple-1q-2023-earnings/">reported &#36;117.2 billion revenue</a> in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
AAPL closed at &#36;181.18 on Friday, down from a 52-week high of &#36;199.62.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-1-earnings-call/">Apple to Hold February 1 Earnings Call Just Ahead of Vision Pro Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-hold-february-1-earnings-call-just-ahead-of-vision-pro-launch.2415764/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Vision Pro ZEISS Lens Inserts to Start at &#36;99</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">announcement</a> of the launch date for its Vision Pro headset earlier today, Apple revealed that the optional optical inserts will begin at &#36;99.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-lenses.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898584" /><br/>
Because of the way the headset fits against the face, it does not accommodate glasses, but Apple has a solution for those who need reading or prescription lenses. Apple is partnering with ZEISS to offer optical inserts that can be customized to each person's vision requirements. <br/>
<br/>
Apple will offer two versions of the ZEISS Optical Inserts at different price points. "ZEISS Optical Inserts — Readers" will be available for &#36;99, while "ZEISS Optical Inserts — Prescription" will be available for &#36;149. The inserts will attach to the Vision Pro lenses magnetically, allowing for precise viewing and eye tracking.<br/>
<br/>
Glasses wearers will need a valid prescription to get the inserts, and not all prescriptions will be supported, so there will be some limitations that might prevent some people from using the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The inserts are the only optional purchase directly for the Vision Pro headset that Apple has announced so far. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/vision-pro-ships-with-dual-loop-band/">Vision Pro headset comes with</a> a Solo Knit Band, a Dual Loop Band, a Light Seal, two Light Seal Cushions, a cover for the front of the device, a polishing cloth, battery unit, USB-C charging cable, and USB-C power adapter. <br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders of the Vision Pro start on Friday, January 19 and the device goes on sale in the United States on Friday, February 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/vision-pro-lens-inserts-to-start-at-99/">Apple Vision Pro ZEISS Lens Inserts to Start at &#36;99</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-zeiss-lens-inserts-to-start-at-99.2415758/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/">Chipolo</a> today announced the launch of a series of "Perfectly Imperfect" CARD Spot wallet trackers, which are identical to its standard Chipolo CARD Spot trackers, but with flaws in the plastic casing.<br/>
<br/>

This limited edition series takes advantage of plastic that would otherwise have been discarded and wasted. The item trackers have a blemish on one side and a "Perfectly Imperfect" engraving on the other side.<blockquote>"Chipolo is excited to introduce the 'Perfectly Imperfect' limited series of CARD Spot trackers, as it's another testament to our dedication to create products that make our lives easier -- both physically, through functionality and mentally, by helping to bring people peace of mind", said Primož Zelenšek, Co-founder and CEO at Chipolo. "Through this campaign, we want to inspire a shift in perspective, encouraging people to embrace their imperfections and recognize the real beauty in what makes each of us irreplaceable."</blockquote>The Chipolo CARD Spot is designed to fit inside a wallet, and it works with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> network. The CARD Spot can be tracked right alongside Apple devices and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app.<br/>
<br/>
Chipolo plans to donate &#36;1 to a non-profit organization for each of the CARD Spots that are sold, and each one is <a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/">priced at &#36;35</a>, the same as the standard CARD Spots. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chipolo/">Chipolo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/ces-2024-chipolo-card-spot/">CES 2024: Chipolo Launches &#039;Perfectly Imperfect&#039; Find My Wallet Trackers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-chipolo-launches-perfectly-imperfect-find-my-wallet-trackers.2415752/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung at CES has announced its popular Smart Monitor M8 is getting a refresh for 2024, with some extra software features seemingly aimed at deepening the display's support for other devices in the company's ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Samsung-Smart-Monitor-M80D.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929427" /><br/>
The upcoming "M80D" model includes a Multi Control feature that allows images and text to be moved between the display and a Galaxy Book, Tablet, or Phone, while a Galaxy Buds owners will be able to pair their earphones for a spatial audio experience with head tracking.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung says it has also added the ability to pair a Galaxy Watch for those looking to perform guided workouts using the display, and an easier way to control monitor settings with the click of a mouse, where previous models only allowed for adjustments via a remote.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, it looks like the iMac-style 4K flat-panel monitor hasn't changed in the hardware department from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/24/samsung-smart-monitor-m8-2023-update/">last year's M8 model</a>, which features 400 nits of brightness, a 60Hz refresh rate (non variable), 99% sRGB, and adaptive picture technology.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the display retains key features like USB-C charging connectivity, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> 2 support, an integrated webcam, and several smart TV features that enable it to be used when not connected to a PC. <br/>
<br/>
Samsung's M8 doesn't support the P3 color gamut and isn't as bright as Apple's 5K Studio Display, but as a more affordable alternative it is likely remain appealing to some Mac users.<br/>
<br/>
The original M8 comes in 27-inch (~&#36;650) and 32-inch (~&#36;700) sizes, although Samsung only mentioned a 32-inch version of the M80D. Regardless, both sizes have a 11.39mm thick chassis, which is 0.1mm thinner than Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, and include a flat back, thin bezels, and a height and tilt adjustable stand. Expect Samsung's refreshed monitor to arrive in sometime later in the year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/samsung-smart-monitor-4k-refresh/">CES 2024: Samsung Unveils Refreshed iMac-Style 32-Inch 4K Smart Monitor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-samsung-unveils-refreshed-imac-style-32-inch-4k-smart-monitor.2415750/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="http://mophie.com">Mophie</a> today unveiled new Juice Pack battery cases designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. Priced at &#36;100, the Juice Pack is designed to add additional battery life to Apple's latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/mophie-juice-pack-iphone-15.jpg" alt="" width="1671" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929067" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; case has a 2,400 mAh battery, while the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; model has a 2,600 mAh battery. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max version has a larger 2,800 mAh battery. At this capacity, the cases won't provide a full charge for any of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, but they will provide a partial charge for long days of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; usage.<br/>
<br/>
When connected to a USB-C charger, the case will direct power to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; first, and when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s battery is full, the case itself will charge. Mophie says that ergonomics and design were taken into account with the Juice Pack, leading to its soft-touch exterior. Raised corners and a high impact protection system are designed to protect the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from scratches and cracks.<br/>
<br/>
Mophie plans to accept pre-orders for the new Juice Pack options starting in February.<br/>
<br/>
Mophie also provided launch details for its first Qi2 devices, which were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/mophie-unveils-qi2-accessories/">announced back in September</a>. The &#36;70 Snap+ Powerstation Mini With Stand, the &#36;130 Snap+ 3-in-1 Stand, and the &#36;70 Snap+ Wireless Charging Vent Mount are set to come out in March and will be <a href="http://mophie.com">available on the Mophie website</a>.<br/>
<br/>

All three products offer support for the Qi2 wireless charging standard and will be able to charge the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models at 15W (12W for the 13 mini), the same speed as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>.<br/>

Mophie's Snap+ Powerstation Mini received a 2024 CES Innovation Award.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming OLED iPad Pro will start at &#36;1,500, rising to between &#36;1,800 and &#36;2,000 depending on size and configuration, representing a major increase in prices compared to Apple's current equivalents. That's according to a new report on the news aggregator account <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223315350204&navType=by">"yeux1122" on the Naver blog</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
This is the second time a Korean source has claimed that Apple's new iPad Pros will be vastly more expensive that the company's existing models. Last March, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">report</a> by <em>The Elec</em> estimated prices starting at &#36;1,500 and &#36;1,800 for the 11-inch and 13-inch models, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
The &#36;2,000 figure for the 13-inch model in the latest report could refer to a new, higher storage capacity offered by Apple, although that would actually present a slightly lower top-end price – the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro maxed out at 2TB starts from &#36;2,100, depending on Wi-Fi or cellular configuration.<br/>
<br/>
If accurate, these price hikes would make the new 11-inch device over 80% more expensive than the existing 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with LED Liquid Retina display, which starts at &#36;799. As for the 13-inch model, assuming a base configuration costing &#36;1,800, it would be around 60% more expensive than the current 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR display, which starts at &#36;1,099. <br/>
<br/>
For further reference, the OLED iPad Pro price estimates far exceed the starting price of some MacBook configurations that Apple currently sells, with the 13.6-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip starting at &#36;1,199. The main reason for the price hikes is believed to be the large proportion of material costs taken up by Apple's OLED panel procurement from the likes of LG and Samsung.<br/>
<br/>
Today's report suggests that Apple will justify the higher prices by increasing storage and emphasizing the benefits in quality of OLED over existing iPad screens, particularly the higher contrast and brightness offered at an equivalent or lower level of power consumption. The report also implies that Apple will promote the new devices' thinness and lightness compared to rival tablets and/or previous-generation iPads.<br/>
<br/>
MagSafe charging is a possibility for the upcoming iPad Pro models, and the devices will also be accompanied by a refreshed version of the Magic Keyboard that includes a larger trackpad to make the iPad Pro look more like a laptop than the current model, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.</a><br/>
<br/>
New ‌iPad Air‌ and ‌iPad Pro‌ models and accompanying accessories are expected to launch around the end of March, which is also when Apple plans to release iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4. Apple is likely to hold a spring event to introduce the new devices, according to Gurman.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/oled-ipad-prices-to-start-1500-dollars/">OLED iPad Pros Could Start From &#36;1,500, Rising to as Much as &#36;2,000</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oled-ipad-pros-could-start-from-1-500-rising-to-as-much-as-2-000.2415745/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to be facing an uphill battle to reverse falling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales in China, with last year's double-digit decline projected to deepen through 2024 owing to strong interest in Huawei's latest home-grown lineup, according to analyst expectations (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-08/iphone-sales-in-china-to-fall-double-digits-jefferies-says">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/huawei-mate-pro-60.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929400" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Huawei Mate 60 Pro</em></div><br/>
In an investor note on Sunday citing industry checks, Jeffries analyst Edison Lee said Apple in December suffered a 30% year-on-year decline in &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales in the country while the rest of the market grew, with Huawei seeing the fastest growth thanks to its latest Mate 60 lineup.<br/>
<br/>
Jefferies estimates Huawei shipped 35 million smartphones last year, with only supply constraints preventing it from hitting even bigger heights spurred by a "patriotic fervor" surrounding the phone. <br/>
<br/>
Released in September just weeks before the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, Huawei's Mate 60 Pro uses a new China-made 7-nanometer processor tailored for the local market, showcasing the kind of advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities that US sanctions were originally designed to prevent. <br/>
<br/>
Jeffries forecasts Apple will see a similar double-digit fall in &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales for 2024, indicated by discounts on Apple's smartphone lineup across various online merchants, which are expected to cut into the average selling price without stimulating volume growth.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's efforts to counter the slump are also likely to be hampered by China's decision last year to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/china-expanding-government-iphone-ban/">ban iPhones</a> from the offices of multiple government agencies and state companies.  China has a huge number of state-owned enterprises in power generation, seaport construction, mining, manufacturing, education, and investment markets. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Huawei's comeback is predicted to continue, with the Chinese company continuing to develop and extend its own operating system, HarmonyOS, designed to rival iOS and Android.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/huawei/">Huawei</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/iphone-sales-down-huawei-resurgence-china/">China iPhone Sales Likely to Continue Losing Ground to Huawei in 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/china-iphone-sales-likely-to-continue-losing-ground-to-huawei-in-2024.2415740/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At CES this week, <a href="https://www.belkin.com">Belkin</a> is making a number of Apple-related announcements, including confirmation that several wireless chargers based on the new Qi2 standard derived from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> are just about ready to come to market. Belkin is also making announcements about several wired charging products with GaN technology and an innovative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> stand that keeps you in the camera frame as you move.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/belkin-ces-2024-announcements.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929184" /><br/>
Belkin's initial Qi2 chargers were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/31/belkin-qi2-wireless-chargers/">announced In August</a> and have been working their way through Qi2 certification among the first products supporting the standard. These products include the BoostCharge Convertible Qi2 Wireless Pad to Stand and the BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with Qi2, as well as a similar 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad without the Apple Watch charger. As Qi2 chargers, all of these devices support up to 15-watt charging for iPhones, just like with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/belkin-qi2-convertible.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908388" /><em>BoostCharge Convertible Qi2 Wireless Pad to Stand</em></div><br/>
The Convertible Qi2 Wireless Pad to Stand collapses to a flat pad for convenience and travel, but can then be extended to a stand mode at adjustable angles for easy viewability such as with StandBy mode. It comes with a 5-foot USB-C cable and a 20-watt USB-C power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
The BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with Qi2 is a flat charging pad with one 15-watt Qi2 spot for charging an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and a second 5-watt Qi spot for another phone or AirPods. A detachable Apple Watch charging puck offers fast charging on supported Apple Watch models, and a 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cable is included along with a 30-watt USB-C power adapter on most SKUs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/belkin-qi2-wireless-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908387" /><em>BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with Qi2</em></div><br/>
The BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad with Qi2 offers a similar setup with a flat design, a 15-watt Qi2 pad, and a 5-watt Qi pad for AirPods or another device, but does not include an Apple Watch charging puck. A 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cable is included, as is a 30-watt power adapter on most SKUs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/belkin-2-in-1-magnetic-charging-pad.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929182" /><em>BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad with Qi2</em></div><br/>
In addition to the previously announced Qi2 chargers, Belkin is announcing a few more products in its Qi2 lineup at CES, including a tree-style 3-in-1 stand that's very similar to other 3-in-1 chargers Belkin has been offering for a number of years. The new BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand includes a flat base with a charging spot for AirPods, and then an elevated arm with a Qi2 pad for charging an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at up to 15 watts and an Apple Watch puck with fast charging support.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/belkin-qi2-3-in-1-stand.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929176" /><em>BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand</em></div><br/>
Unlike Belkin's past tree-style chargers, this new one includes swivel support on the Qi2 pad to allow you to easily adjust the angle of your phone while it's on the charger. This stand will be priced at &#36;149.99 and is launching in March.<br/>
<br/>
Finally for the Qi2 family, there's the BoostCharge Pro Magnetic Power Bank, which will be available in a 5,000 mAh model for &#36;59.99, an 8,000 mAh model for &#36;79.99, and a 10,000 mAh model for &#36;99.99 starting in March. All three models include Qi2 support for up to 15 watts of wireless charging, with passthrough charging to simultaneously recharge the power bank and an attached phone.<br/>
<br/>

The power banks also include a kickstand to make it easy to prop your phone up while watching video, reading, or chatting. USB-C ports are included for both recharging and for wired charging from the power banks.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to Qi2 wireless charging products, Belkin is also announcing a pair of wired charging products that use GaN technology for more efficient charging in compact designs. First up is the BoostCharge Pro 4-Port USB-C GaN Charger 200W, which includes four USB-C ports to recharge a variety of high-power devices. Two of the ports support up to 140 watts of charging power while the other two support up to 60 watts, but the maximum total output at any given time is limited to 200 watts. This charger will be priced at &#36;129.99 and is launching in March.<br/>

Second, Belkin is introducing the 6-in-1 Core GaN Dock, which it says is 50% smaller than other 6-in-1 solutions. It includes an HDMI port with support for up to a 4K display, a pair of USB-A ports for legacy devices, a pair of USB-C ports (one with 96-watt power delivery), and a Gigabit Ethernet port. It's priced at &#36;139.99 and it is available to order today with a launch coming soon.<br/>

And finally, Belkin is announcing what it says is the world's first accessory to take advantage of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DockKit">Apple's DockKit framework</a> introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> for face and object tracking. The Auto Tracking Stand Pro is a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging stand for your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that includes a motorized base which supports full 360º swivel and up to 90º tilt. Once paired with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; via NFC, the DockKit framework allows your phone and the stand to work together to register your face and then automatically track to keep you in frame as you move.<br/>
<br/>

It works in both portrait and landscape orientations and with both front and rear cameras, and it supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, the native Camera app, and other videoconferencing apps. The stand has a built-in rechargeable battery that allows it to operate for up to five hours while on the go for vlogging and other scenarios where you may not have ready access to fixed power. While connected to wall power, it can charge your phone via &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; at up to 15 watts, keeping everything powered up.<br/>
<br/>
The Auto Tracking Stand Pro will be priced at &#36;179.99 and Belkin is currently listing it as "coming soon" with customers able to sign up to be notified about availability.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/">Belkin</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/ces-2024-belkin-chargers-auto-tracking-stand/">CES 2024: Belkin Launching Qi2 Chargers, GaN Chargers, and First Apple-Certified Auto Tracking iPhone Stand</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-belkin-launching-qi2-chargers-gan-chargers-and-first-apple-certified-auto-tracking-iphone-stand.2415724/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/">Withings</a>, known primarily for its lineup of iPhone-connected smart scales, today debuted the BeamO, a 4-in-1 home health checkup device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/withings-beamo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929076" /><br/>
The BeamO "multiscope" combines ECG, pulse oximeter, stethoscope, and thermometer sensors into a single device. According to Withings, the BeamO is the "thermometer of the future," able to not only measure temperature, but also provide feedback on heart and lung health.<br/>
<br/>
There are electrodes along the side of the BeamO that allow it to detect blood oxygen levels and heart rate, while also performing a 1-lead ECG (similar to the Apple Watch ECG function).<br/>
<br/>
A temperature scanner detects body temperature from the temporal artery, and with a Piezoelectric disc, it is able to capture chest or back acoustic soundwaves that can be provided to a physician during a telehealth appointment.<br/>
<br/>
Withings says that the BeamO can provide a body checkup in under a minute, alerting users to fever, infection, and possible cardiovascular issues like atrial fibrillation.<br/>
<br/>
BeamO is set to launch in June 2024, and it will cost &#36;250.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/withings/">Withings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/ces-2024-withings-beamo/">CES 2024: Withings Launches &#039;BeamO&#039; Home Health Scanner</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-withings-launches-beamo-home-health-scanner.2415723/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Canadians may soon be eligible to receive a payment from Apple following the company's iPhone battery throttling controversy in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-6s-MacRumors-YouTube.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929156" /><br/>
Apple has agreed to pay up to &#36;14.4 million (CAD) to settle a class action lawsuit in Canada that alleged the company secretly throttled the performance of some iPhone models, and the British Columbia Supreme Court will decide whether to approve the proposed settlement on January 29, according to a <a href="https://www.smartphoneperformancesettlement.ca/">website set up for the case</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If the settlement is approved, those eligible will be able to submit a claim for a payment of up to &#36;150 (CAD) per affected iPhone from Apple. The exact payout amount will depend on the total number of claims that are submitted. Apple has denied the allegations described in the lawsuit, and the settlement does not represent an admission of fault.<br/>
<br/>
The class includes any current or former resident of Canada (excluding Quebec) who owned and/or purchased an iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and/or iPhone SE with iOS 10.2.1 or later installed or downloaded, and/or an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 11.2 or later installed or downloaded, before December 21, 2017.<br/>
<br/>
More information about submitting a claim will be provided on the settlement's website if it is approved — no action is required at this time for those who wish to pursue this option. Those who wish to <a href="https://www.smartphoneperformancesettlement.ca/en/opt-out">opt out</a> of the class action to retain their rights to sue Apple over these allegations must do so by no later than January 10.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was sued in multiple Canadian provinces over iPhone battery throttling in 2018, including Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. The cases were filed shortly after Apple revealed that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/">started throttling the maximum performance of some iPhone models with "chemically aged" batteries</a>, when necessary, to prevent the devices from unexpectedly shutting down. Apple introduced this new power management system in iOS 10.2.1, but it initially failed to mention the change in that update's release notes, leading to public outcry. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/">Apple eventually apologized</a> about its lack of transparency, and temporarily lowered the price of iPhone battery replacements to &#36;29 until the end of 2018.<br/>
<br/>
Apple agreed to pay up to &#36;500 million (USD) to settle a similar class action lawsuit in the U.S., and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/06/apple-starts-iphone-batterygate-payouts/">payments of &#36;92.17 per claim started going out this week</a> to those who submitted claims in that case, marking the end of the so-called "batterygate" saga there.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/">iPhone Slowdown</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/apple-iphone-batterygate-settlement-canada/">Apple Agrees to Pay Canadian Customers Following iPhone Throttling Controversy</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-agrees-to-pay-canadian-customers-following-iphone-throttling-controversy.2415721/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
