		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=46ox5uok">today informed developers</a> about a number of new developer activities that are taking place in November, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> activities, additional Vision Pro labs, technology consultations, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757303" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-developer-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="572" /><br/>
Apple in September began offering a range of "Meet with the Apple Experts" resources for developers, and the labs that are available this month are a continuation of that effort.<br/>
<br/>
There are a range of &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; activities where developers can learn about app discovery, engagement, custom product pages, subscription best practices, and more, plus opportunities for developers to try the Vision Pro at test labs in Cupertino, London, Munich, New York City, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, or Tokyo.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also offering activities focused on the Vision Pro, with the aim of helping developers learn to design and build apps and games for the headset. Developers can opt in to one-on-one consultations as well, getting advice on app design, new technologies, and other topics.<br/>
<br/>
The sessions are held in multiple time zones around the world, with some of them online and some in person. Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/events/view/upcoming-events/?shouldHideClosedEvents=true">full list of Expert sessions</a> is available on its developer website.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-developer-labs-workshops-november/">Apple Invites Developers to Labs, Workshops and Vision Pro Sessions Held in November</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-invites-developers-to-labs-workshops-and-vision-pro-sessions-held-in-november.2410230/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest 16-inch M3 MacBook Pro models are able to fast charge at 140W over USB-C with a 240W USB-C cable, according to a support document <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212755">that was updated today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/USB-C-60w-240w-charge-cable.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911066" /><br/>
2021 and 2022 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M-series chips are limited to faster 140W charging with the USB-C to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> 3 cable that Apple provides due to USB-C limitations, with the USB-C ports offering only up to 100W.<br/>
<br/>
The 2023 16-inch MacBook Pro can charge at the full 140W through &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; or through a USB-C port when a 140W+ power adapter is paired with a 240W cable, such as the 240W USB-C cable that Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU2G3AM/A/240w-usb-c-charge-cable-2-m">began selling in September</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This update is only applicable to 16-inch models as 14-inch models can fast charge with a 96W charger, which USB-C ports were already able to provide for older machines.<br/>
<br/>
The option to fast charge a 16-inch M3 MacBook Pro at 140W over USB-C gives MacBook Pro owners more options when it comes to charging, though it is worth noting that the 240W cables are limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/16-inch-m3-macbook-pro-usb-c-fast-charge/">16-Inch M3 MacBook Pro Can Fast Charge Over USB-C With 240W Cable</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/16-inch-m3-macbook-pro-can-fast-charge-over-usb-c-with-240w-cable.2410224/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MacBook Pro models with the M3 and M3 Pro chips are available starting today, and <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera was in New York so he popped over to the Grand Central station <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> to pick up a new machine to demo to <em>MacRumors</em> readers.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wt94CT7YBL4" title="Apple’s NEW Space Black M3 Pro MacBook Pro Hands-On!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Dan purchased the M3 Pro MacBook Pro, which is a model that hasn't gotten a lot of attention. Apple provided reviewers with new Macs equipped with M3 and M3 Max chips, but we've heard little about the new M3 Pro. For context, the M3 Pro has 150GB/s memory bandwidth, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Pro had 200GB/s.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also tweaked the 12-core M3 Pro to have six performance cores and six efficiency cores rather than the eight performance cores and four efficiency cores the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro chip has, which will impact overall performance. Dan's MacBook Pro is the 16-inch &#36;2,499 version with a 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU, 18GB Unified Memory, and a 512GB SSD.<br/>
<br/>
On Geekbench 6, the M3 Pro earned a single-core score of 3085 and a multi-core score of 15155. Comparatively, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro chip that has a 12-core CPU and 19-core GPU earned a single core score of 2643 and a multi-core score of 14206.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 Pro outperforms the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro, but not by a lot. Single-core speed is up 16.7 percent, while multi-core speed is up 6.7 percent. Note that this is one benchmark result so there could be some variance, but it is in line with what we expected.<br/>
<br/>
GPU performance is nearly flat. The M3 Pro MacBook Pro earned an OpenCL score of 51093, while the equivalent &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro version had a score of 50302 for a difference of 1.6 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Other than the M3 chips, there's not much new with the MacBook Pro models. The M3 Pro and M3 Max come in a Space Black color, which is much darker than expected in person, and it is indeed resistant to fingerprints as Apple promised.<br/>
<br/>
The only other new feature is a slight change to the brightness of the display, which is 600 nits for SDR content, up from 500 nits. You won't see any other changes, with the machine offering the same design and internal specs.<br/>
<br/>
We'll have a video of the M3 Max MacBook Pro coming up in the future, as those machines will start delivering to customers later this week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/m3-macbook-pro-hands-on/">Hands-On With the New M3 Pro MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-the-new-m3-pro-macbook-pro.2410222/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside iOS 17.1.1, Apple released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 17.1.1 software to fix a bug that could cause some &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; speakers to respond slowly or fail to complete requests.<br/>
<br/>

Today's update comes a couple of weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-1/">release of the HomePod 17.1 update</a>, which added Enhance Dialogue for the original &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ software is installed automatically on the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌ unless the feature is disabled‌‌‌‌, but the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ can also be manually updated in the Home app by following the instructions in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/homepod-software-update/">HomePod‌‌ update how to</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-homepod-17-1-1-software/">Apple Releases HomePod 17.1.1 Software With Fix for Siri Response Bug</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-homepod-17-1-1-software-with-fix-for-siri-response-bug.2410215/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new firmware for the Beats Fit Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> earbuds. The Beats Fit Pro and &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; can now be updated to firmware version 6B27, up from the prior 5B66 firmware that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/beats-fit-pro-powerbeats-pro-firmware-update/">came out in May</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/beats-fit-pro-feb23-open.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-885885" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what's included in firmware updates for the Beats Fit Pro and &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj;, so we don't know what improvements or bug fixes the firmware offers.<br/>
<br/>
There's no standard way to upgrade the ‌Beats‌‌ software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the earbuds are connected to an iOS device. Putting the Beats‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting them to a power source, and then pairing them‌‌‌‌‌ to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> should force the update after a short period of time.<br/>
<br/>
If we find any notable changes after the firmware update is installed, we'll share details, but the software likely includes performance improvements and bug fixes rather than outward-facing changes.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/beats-fit-pro-powerbeats-pro-firmware-update-2/">Apple Releases New Firmware for Beats Fit Pro and Powerbeats Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-beats-fit-pro-and-powerbeats-pro.2410214/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌‌.1.1 can be downloaded for free through the Apple Watch app on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or later by opening it up and going to General &gt; Software Update. To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery and it needs to be placed on a charger.<br/>
<br/>
Today's update addresses an issue that is causing some Apple Watch models to drain battery more quickly than expected. Complaints about Apple Watch battery started after the launch of watchOS 10.1, and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/04/watchos-update-to-fix-battery-drain-issue/">confirmed in a memo</a> over the weekend that the battery problems would be fixed in a software release.<blockquote>This update provides important bug fixes and addresses an issue that could cause the battery to drain more quickly for some users.</blockquote>Apple is already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-beta-1-to-developers/">testing watchOS 10.2</a>, an update that is expected to be released alongside iOS 17.2 in December.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-watchos-10-1-1/">Apple Releases WatchOS 10.1.1 With Fix for Apple Watch Battery Drain Bug</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-watchos-10-1-1-with-fix-for-apple-watch-battery-drain-bug.2410213/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

Employees were told about a development pause last week, with engineers asked to focus on fixing flaws and boosting software performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's software chief Craig Federighi has been making an effort in recent years to ensure that software bugs are addressed, sometimes resulting in features that need to be delayed. Sources that spoke to Gurman said that with the upcoming software updates, the software engineering management team working under Federighi found too many bugs that were missed in internal testing, leading to a week-long sprint to address the issues.<br/>
<br/>
During that week period, all development on future features was stopped to allow engineers to work solely on improving the existing software. Apple is lifting the pause this week so that work on new capabilities for iOS 18 and its sister updates can continue.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last month finished the first "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>" versions of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. Work on further development was paused, with Apple also taking a brief break from working on iOS 17.4, expected to be released next March. Given that work on future software was only paused for a week, no release delays are expected next year. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-engineers-ios-18-bug-fix-focus/">Apple Briefly Paused Work on New Features for iOS 18 and macOS 15 to Clean Up Bugs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-briefly-paused-work-on-new-features-for-ios-18-and-macos-15-to-clean-up-bugs.2410180/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Choosing a new Mac often involves consideration of the many Apple silicon chips now on offer, so our comprehensive guide covers their generations, variations, and performance benchmarks to help you decide which is best for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Mac-Chip-Comparison-Buyers-Guide-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-902570" /><br/>
After iterating for over a decade in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Apple in 2020 brought its custom silicon chip technology to the Mac, enabling major performance and power efficiency improvements. Since then, Apple silicon has expanded to every Mac model, spurring new designs and capabilities that were previously impossible.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Apple-M3-chip-series.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920046" /><br/>
<br/>
Understanding the distinctions between Apple silicon chips will help you make an informed decision when selecting the right Mac for your needs. There have been three generations of Apple silicon for the Mac, each with up to four different chip variants. The main differences between the four different chip variants are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>M1, M2, and M3</strong>: Standard Apple silicon chip with a balance of performance and power-efficiency. </li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Pro, M2 Pro, and M3 Pro</strong>: Apple silicon chip with additional high-performance CPU cores. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Pro feature twice the memory bandwidth of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 chips (200GB/s), while the M3 Pro features 50% more memory bandwidth than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 chips (150GB/s).</li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Max, M2 Max, and M3 Max</strong>: Doubles the GPU cores of the &zwnj;M1 Pro&zwnj;, &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro, or M3 Pro and features up to twice the memory bandwidth (400GB/s) of the &zwnj;M1 Pro&zwnj; or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro chips for better graphics performance. M3 Max also adds extra CPU cores.</li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Ultra and M2 Ultra</strong>: Encompasses two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/">M1 Max</a> or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips for double overall CPU and GPU performance, as well as twice the memory bandwidth (800GB/s).</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="apple_silicon_generations">Apple Silicon Generations</h3><br/>
With the introduction of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; series of chips in 2022 and M3 series of chips in 2023, Apple made some key improvements over the initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> series from 2020.<br/>
<br/>

Deciding how many CPU cores you need depends on the specific tasks and workflows you intend to perform on your Mac. For example, if you primarily engage in basic tasks like web browsing, document editing, and media consumption, an eight-core CPU should suffice. On the other hand, if you work with demanding workloads like software development, opting for a higher core count can provide significant performance benefits. Similarly, graphics-intense workflows like video editing, 3D modeling, or gaming will benefit from additional GPU cores.<br/>

<br/>
The data on the below table is calculated from Geekbench 6 <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks">results users uploaded to Geekbench</a>. Geekbench 6 scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 2,500 (which is the score of an Intel Core i7-12700 performing the same task).<br/>

The &zwnj;M1&zwnj;, &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, and M3 chips demonstrate performance improvements in single-core and multi-core tasks as you move from the base to the Ultra variants, with the M3 chip showcasing even higher performance across the board. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that benchmarks do not tell the whole story. Benchmarks focus on specific tasks and synthetic workloads, and do not always accurately capture real-world usage scenarios and variations.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="unified_memory">Unified Memory</h3><br/>
Apple silicon chips have a unified memory architecture, meaning that the RAM is tied directly to the processor for maximum speed and efficiency. This means that the chip you choose determines what memory option are available, and it is not upgradable at a later date. <br/>

<br/>
Deciding how much RAM you need depends on your specific tasks and usage patterns. 8GB should be enough for most users, but upgrading to 16GB or 24GB could be sensible for users with more intense multitasking requirements. Amounts of memory beyond 32GB are generally reserved for seriously demanding workflows.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><br/>
Overall, if you are new to Apple silicon and are still not sure which chip to buy, use the following rationale:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1, M2, or M3 if...</strong> you need a good balance of price, performance, and battery life and have normal day-to-day computing requirements.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1 Pro, M2 Pro, or M3 Pro if...</strong> you need a performance-focused chip for slightly more intense workflows.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1 Max, M2 Max, or M3 Max if...</strong> you need additional graphics performance for working with images, videos, graphic design, or games.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1 Ultra or M2 Ultra if...</strong> you need the best possible overall performance for extremely intense professional workflows.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
It is generally not worth upgrading from any of the individual &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chips to their direct successors and it may be better to wait for Apple to launch the M4 series of chips at some point in the next couple of years before upgrading if you are already an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; user.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/">MacBook Pro 13"</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13">13" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro">Mac Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1">Mac Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon-buyers-guide/">Apple Silicon Buyer&#039;s Guide: Which Chip Should You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-silicon-buyers-guide-which-chip-should-you-choose.2395320/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to discontinue the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with mini-LED backlighting in 2024, according to a recent report from <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20231103-11903.html">Taiwanese research firm TrendForce</a>, suggesting that the tablet will not remain in the lineup for a reduced price following the launch of the rumored 13-inch iPad Pro with an OLED display next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/ipad-pro-m1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1780" height="1001" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800056" /><br/>
TrendForce:<blockquote>The shipment volume for Mini LED notebooks is estimated to decrease by approximately 39% YoY. Meanwhile, with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro expected to be discontinued in 2024, the shipment volume of Mini LED tablets is expected to decrease by about 15.6% YoY, making these two the only applications expected to decline.</blockquote>In December 2022, oft-accurate display industry analyst Ross Young was first to report that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro would be succeeded by a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/">slightly larger 13-inch model</a> with an OLED display. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">OLED displays, an M3 chip, and an aluminum Magic Keyboard</a> to launch next year.<br/>
<br/>
OLED display technology would allow for the next iPad Pro models to offer increased brightness, higher contrast ratio, greater color accuracy, and lower power consumption compared to the existing models with LCD panels. Young said Apple would be using very thin hybrid OLED displays with a combination of flexible and rigid materials, which could allow for the next iPad Pro models to have a slightly thinner design.<br/>
<br/>
iPad Pro models released since 2017 support ProMotion, allowing for a variable refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz. The switch to OLED would likely allow for the refresh rate to drop down even further to 10Hz or lower to save battery life. iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro models can reach as low as 1Hz while in always-on display mode.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/05/all-ipads-expected-to-be-updated-in-2024/">expected to update the iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad</a> in 2024, but none of those models are expected to switch to OLED next year. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/">TrendForce</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-discontinued-2024-report/">12.9-Inch iPad Pro With Mini-LED Display Expected to Be Discontinued Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-with-mini-led-display-expected-to-be-discontinued-next-year.2410171/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has expanded High Power Mode to the new 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Max chip, according to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/11/m3-macbook-pro-review-peak-performance/"><em>Six Colors</em> editor-in-chief Jason Snell</a>. The feature was previously only available on the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max and M2 Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/High-Power-Mode-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921421" /><br/>
"For some tests, I switched the MacBook Pro into High Power Mode, which is now available on both 14- and 16-inch models in the M3 Max configuration," wrote Snell, in his review of the new MacBook Pros. "I didn't actually find it made much of a difference in the tests I was running, but it sure did make the fans kick in at a very loud volume."<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212852">support document</a>, Apple says High Power Mode allows a MacBook Pro's fans to run at higher speeds, and this additional cooling may allow the system to deliver higher performance for "intensive sustained workloads," such as 8K video color grading.<br/>
<br/>
On macOS Ventura and later, High Power Mode can be enabled in the System Settings app under Battery by clicking on the dropdown menus next to "On battery" or "On power adapter" and selecting the "High Power" option.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M3 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/first-m3-mac-orders-australia-nz/">began arriving to customers</a> over the past day, and some early adopters have discovered that the laptop cannot currently be updated to macOS Sonoma over the air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/No-13-Inch-M3-MacBook-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921296" /><br/>
As <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1721742053170684065">noted by @aaronp613 on X</a>, at least some 14-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 chip shipped with an unreleased build of macOS Ventura 13.5 installed. When users attempt to update to macOS Sonoma in the System Settings app, macOS Ventura 13.5 is listed as the latest version available instead of macOS Sonoma 14.1.<br/>
<br/>
One user who experienced this issue is <a href="https://twitter.com/ZONEofTECH/status/1721868285732344224">Daniel Rotar</a>, host of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZONEofTECH/">YouTube channel ZONEofTECH</a>, according to a post he shared on X today. Additional users across <a href="https://twitter.com/nacookan/status/1721867659963412668">X</a> and the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-m3-macbook-pro-and-imac-orders-begin-arriving-to-customers.2410091/post-32702848">MacRumors Forums</a> have mentioned the issue.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok, here’s something weird. <br><br>Our M3 MacBook Pro shipped with Ventura and can’t seem to update to Sonoma at all. Version not compatible. <br><br>Our M3 Pro MacBook Pro shipped with Sonoma. <br><br>Did anyone else get an M3 that shipped with Ventura? <a href="https://t.co/me0kLZjk6f">pic.twitter.com/me0kLZjk6f</a></p>&mdash; Daniel (@ZONEofTECH) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZONEofTECH/status/1721868285732344224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Given that macOS Ventura 13.5 was released in July, it seems that Apple began stockpiling the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip several months ago. <br/>
<br/>
It's unclear when Apple will address this problem, but in the meantime, software researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolas09F9">Nicolás Álvarez</a> <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-m3-macbook-pro-and-imac-orders-begin-arriving-to-customers.2410091/post-32702982">said</a> that affected users can <a href="https://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/54/11/042-41700-A_6GDS7ETYNV/zxpkgymp3w9bm3py7ybs9n9ud27qwnwx7u/InstallAssistant.pkg">download the Install Assistant</a> for the M3-compatible version of macOS Sonoma 14.1 and manually install the update. It is also possible to enable macOS public betas to get the update to appear.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> As noted <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/07/m3-macbook-pro-imac-sonoma-fails/">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>, this issue appears to affect the new iMac with the M3 chip as well.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239">macOS Ventura</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/14-inch-macbook-pro-m3-macos-sonoma-update-issue/">M3 MacBook Pro Ships With macOS Ventura, Can&#039;t Yet Be Updated to macOS Sonoma Over the Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-macbook-pro-ships-with-macos-ventura-cant-yet-be-updated-to-macos-sonoma-over-the-air.2410150/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting today, Apple's refreshed M3 iMac and MacBook Pro models with M3 and M3 Pro chips are available for same-day or next-day pickup at Apple Stores, with no pre-order required. Online orders are also beginning to arrive to customers today. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919460" /><br/>
Customers across the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and other regions can now place an order on Apple's website or in the Apple Store app and arrange for in-store pickup at a local retail location.<br/>
<br/>
To order a product with Apple Store pickup, add the product to your bag on Apple.com, proceed to checkout, select the "I'll pick it up" option, enter your ZIP code, choose an available Apple Store location, and select a pickup date. Payment is completed online, and a valid government-issued photo ID and the order number may be required upon pickup.<br/>
<br/>
The refreshed 24-inch iMac includes an Apple-designed M3 Arm-based chip that replaces the M1 chip and brings significant speed and efficiency improvements. The iMac with M3 chip is up to 2x faster than the M1 iMac, with support for up to 24GB of unified memory, Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. There are no major external design changes to the M3 iMac, which is available in a range of bright colors, including green, blue, pink, silver, orange, yellow, and purple. <br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models can be purchased today with the M3 and M3 Pro chips, while models with the new M3 Max chip won't become available until later in November. The MacBook Pro models have slightly brighter display levels when viewing SDR content, and also include support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. Apple offers the MacBook Pro in silver, space gray, and space black aluminum color options, depending on chip configuration.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing for the MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,599 for the 14-inch model and &#36;2,499 for the 16-inch model, while the iMac starts at &#36;1,299.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/m3-imac-macbook-pro-now-available/">M3 iMac and MacBook Pro Models Now Available for Same-Day Pickup</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-imac-and-macbook-pro-models-now-available-for-same-day-pickup.2410137/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/242690316/testing-new-experimental-generative-ai-features">today announced</a> that it is testing two new generative AI features designed to improve the YouTube viewing experience. A select number of YouTube users will have access to these new additions during Google's testing period.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/google-ai-youtube.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921299" /><br/>
For YouTube videos with long comment threads, YouTube will use artificial intelligence to organize them into themes or comment topics to facilitate conversation. Google says that creators can use these comment summaries to jump into comment discussions or draw inspiration for new content.<br/>
<br/>
Topics are pulled from published comments, and will not be created from comments held for review or that include blocked words. The comment test is being done on mobile, so users who have access will see a star topic on a small number of videos in English.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube is also gaining a conversational AI tool that is able to provide answers to questions about the video that you're watching. It can provide background information, offer up suggestions for related content, and more, without interrupting playback. For academic videos, the AI is able to provide quizzes and responses that Google says "encourage deeper understanding."<br/>
<br/>
Conversational AI is available to a small number of people on a subset of videos, and those who have access will see a star icon.<br/>
<br/>
While some users have access to these options for test purposes, YouTube Premium subscribers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/new">can opt in to these new features</a> as the YouTube Premium subscription includes access to experimental features. Comment topics are available to premium members today, while the conversational AI option will be available in the coming weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Google says that the AI features are experimental and that the company "may not always get it right," which is why these tests are available to a limited number of customers as Google collects feedback.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/generative-ai-tools-youtube/">Google Experimenting With New Generative AI Features for YouTube</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-experimenting-with-new-generative-ai-features-for-youtube.2410105/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/final-cut-pro-for-mac-and-ipad-get-powerful-updates/">today announced upcoming updates</a> for Final Cut Pro, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac apps set to gain new features that Apple says will streamline workflows.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/final-cut-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921303" /><br/>
Final Cut Pro on the Mac will be updated with organizational refinements like automatic timeline scrolling. Users will be able to keep their clips in view during playback, with the view able to be adjusted using keyboard shortcuts or the Zoom option.<br/>
<br/>
The organization of the timeline will be viewable at a glance, and it will be easier to differentiate clips by assigned role using distinct colors. Apple is also adding tools for cleaning up complex timeline sections and fine tuning edits by combining overlapping connected clips into a single connected storyline.<br/>
<br/>
On Apple silicon Macs, exporting projects in H.264 and HEVC will be faster than before as Final Cut Pro is able to send video segments to available media engines for simultaneous processing.<br/>
<br/>
On the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, the updated version of Final Cut Pro will include voiceover capabilities that will let creators record narration and audio directly into the timeline with the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. In pro camera mode, stabilization will now improve shaky footage for smoother video, and there are new options for combining connected clips.<br/>
<br/>
Editing is being sped up through new keyboard shortcuts for voiceover and grouping clips, plus there are new color-grading presets and titles.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[When new products launch, Apple fans in Australia and New Zealand are always the first to get their hands on updated devices because of their time zone. It is Tuesday, November 7 in those two countries, which means customers who ordered a new M3 MacBook Pro or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> are now beginning to receive their shipments.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919851" /><br/>
Apple customers will soon be sharing photos and first impressions of the New Macs on Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, and the <em>MacRumors</em> forums. If you've received a new Mac, make sure to let us know your thoughts in the comments below!<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced the new Macs at its "Scary Fast" event on October 30, which was the first nighttime event that Apple has held. Apple debuted the M3-series chips, and it also marked the first time that standard, Pro, and Max Apple silicon chips have been introduced at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models can be purchased with the M3, M3 Pro, or M3 Max chip, while the 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; has the M3. Today's orders will feature the M3 and M3 Pro machines, as the MacBook Pro models with M3 Max had delivery dates ranging from November 9 to November 13 when Apple first began accepting orders. We won't see customers with the initial M3 Max MacBook Pro orders until later this week.<br/>
<br/>
Apple made no design updates to the MacBook Pro or the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; when it refreshed the chips inside. The MacBook Pro models also received a minor display update to increase the SDR brightness by 100 nits, while the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; also got support for Wi-Fi 6E, more maximum memory, and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
Built on 3-nanometer technology, the M3 chips have a next-generation GPU with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, along with Dynamic Caching for improved GPU utilization. According to Apple, the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips are up to 50 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>, &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro, and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
New Zealand does not have any Apple retail stores, so customers in Australia will be the first to be able to pick up one of the new Macs in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>. We are not expecting supply shortages, and the updated machines should be readily available for those who want one. Note that Apple Stores offer stock configurations, so customers who want to upgrade the memory, SSD, or chip will need to order a custom machine online.<br/>
<br/>
Following New Zealand and Australia, sales and deliveries of the new Macs will kick off in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and finally, North and South America. Make sure to stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em> because we'll have a hands-on and unboxing tomorrow, as well as deeper looks at the performance of the new machines.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/first-m3-mac-orders-australia-nz/">First M3 MacBook Pro and iMac Orders Begin Arriving to Customers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-m3-macbook-pro-and-imac-orders-begin-arriving-to-customers.2410091/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A minor iOS 17.1.1 update is likely to be released for the iPhone this week, as a protected account with a proven track record shared the build number 21B91 for the update today on X, formerly known as Twitter. The account typically shares build numbers for upcoming iOS updates less than a week before they are released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-17.1.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920500" /><br/>
Last week, we were first to report that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/ios-17-1-1-is-coming/">internally testing iOS 17.1.1</a>, based on evidence of the software version in our website's analytics logs. The update will almost certainly be focused on bug fixes and security patches.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear exactly which bugs will be addressed in iOS 17.1.1. The update might include the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/">fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple rolled out in the iOS 17.2 beta, and it could resolve an issue where <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/ios-17-1-shutdown-bug-no-fix/">some iPhones temporarily shut off overnight</a> for users still experiencing that. Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/">promised to fix a BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup in an unspecified update coming later this year.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 remains in beta testing, and it is expected to be released in December. That update includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">many new features and changes</a>, including Apple's promised Journal app, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<br/>
<br/>
We also reported that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/04/watchos-update-to-fix-battery-drain-issue/">preparing to release a watchOS update soon</a> with a fix for excessive Apple Watch battery drain. It's likely that update will be watchOS 10.1.1, but it could be watchOS 10.2 if Apple needs more time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/ios-17-1-1-likely-to-be-released-this-week/">Apple Likely to Release iOS 17.1.1 This Week With iPhone Bug Fixes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-release-ios-17-1-1-this-week-with-iphone-bug-fixes.2410080/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
