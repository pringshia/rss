		<description><![CDATA[Apple announced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> three years ago today at its "Hi, Speed" event alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro, offering a small form-factor version of its smart speaker for the first time, with a price tag of just &#36;99.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/homepod-mini-thumb-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-770560" /><br/>
Less than half a year after announcing the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/">discontinued</a> the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, leaving the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; as the company's only smart speaker until earlier this year when Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-announces-new-homepod/">relaunched the full-size HomePod</a> form factor. The newly reintroduced &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; offers a large number of features that were previously exclusive to the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;, including an Apple Watch S-series chip, a U1 ultra wideband chip, Thread support, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/homepods-now-feature-temperature-humidity-sensor/">temperature and humidity sensor</a>, and a larger backlit touch surface that illuminates from edge to edge.<br/>
<br/>
Apple refreshed the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; with color in 2021, adding Blue, Yellow, and Orange options, but the device has remained otherwise unchanged since its introduction. It is now among the oldest devices that Apple still sells, surpassed only by the Pro Display XDR and second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>What Next for the HomePod mini?</h3><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> was first to highlight Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/07/new-homepod-mini-and-high-end-homepod/">work on a second-generation HomePod mini</a> in August 2022. Gurman has since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/22/gurman-apple-not-working-on-new-homepod-mini/">expressed skepticism</a> about what a new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; could offer since "the latest &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; doesn't include any major new functions that aren't already in the &#36;99 mini." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/f1602608757.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="445" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-763787" /><br/>
A second-generation &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; could conceivably introduce a lower-latency Handoff experience with the second-generation ultra wideband chip, improved sound and microphones, and the S7, S8, S9, or S10 chip. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> requests are now processed locally on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> thanks to the improved performance of the S9 chip, so bringing the same hardware to the next-generation &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; could considerably boost &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s responsiveness. A new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; could also see specification upgrades, such as Wi-Fi 6E support.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; currently contains the S5 chip from the Apple Watch Series 5 and first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>. 2024 will likely see the introduction of the S10 chip in the next-generation Apple Watch, so that's the most advanced chip Apple could feasibly give the device if it launches before late 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The 2023 &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; contains the S7 chip, the same chip used in 2021's Apple Watch Series 7. Despite the introduction of the S8 chip in late 2022 in the Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Ultra, and second-generation &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj;, Apple elected to use the S7 chip. This suggests it isn't certain that Apple will use its latest S-series chip in the second-generation &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/s9-chip-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1501" height="844" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913379" /><br/>
The S6, S7, and S8 chips are all fundamentally the same and based on the A13 Bionic chip. The S9 chip, on the other hand, is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/apple-watch-series-9-updated-chip/">based on the A15 Bionic chip</a>, leading to major performance and efficiency improvements. The S6, S7, or S8 chip would still be a notable upgrade for the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;, but the S9 or S10 chip would offer even more substantial enhancements.<br/>
<br/>
It also seems highly likely that a new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; will come in a refreshed selection of color options. The current device is available in Space Gray, Blue, Yellow, White, and Orange. With the reintroduced full-size &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, Apple swapped Space Gray for Midnight, so a similar switch seems likely for the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; at a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Release Date</h3><br/>
In February, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that Apple will begin mass shipments of the second-generation &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/homepod-mini-2-shipping-next-year/">in the second half of 2024</a>, which seems likely given the age of the current model and apparent active development on a new version for over a year.<br/>
<br/>
It is also possible that Apple could wait to introduce a new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; until the debut of a third-generation full-size &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, especially if it includes new features. Apple is developing an updated version of the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; that will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">7-inch display</a>, according to &zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj;. The &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a 7-inch display is expected to come out <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/homepod-with-screen-delayed-next-year/">next year at the earliest</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/homepod-mini-now-three-years-old/">HomePod Mini Now Three Years Old: Here&#039;s What to Expect From the Next Generation</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-mini-now-three-years-old-heres-what-to-expect-from-the-next-generation.2407441/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>'s screen assembly will be rotated to reduce the effect of "jelly scrolling" that some users complain about with the current model, according to a Weibo leaker with an early track record for disclosing accurate information about Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ipad-mini-9.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-818328" /><br/>
The account, known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/NnyGqvZHU#comment">Instant Digital</a>," claims that in addition to reduced jelly scrolling, the new &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will also feature the A16 Bionic chip and front camera improvements.<br/>
<br/>
"Jelly scrolling" refers to screen tearing, which can cause text or images on one side of the screen to appear to be tilted downwards because of a mismatch in refresh rates. It can cause one side of the display to look as if it is responding faster than the other side in a visual disturbance that is hard to ignore once noticed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the phenomenon is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/28/apple-jelly-scrolling-normal-behavior/">normal behavior</a> for LCD iPads. Since LCD screens refresh line by line, there is a tiny delay between when the lines at the top and lines at the bottom are refreshed. But while this may be normal behavior for LCD screens, it can appear more obvious when observed on the ‌‌&zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s smaller screen‌‌.<br/>
<br/>
Users have generally only complained about jelly scrolling when the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/ipad-mini-6-jelly-scroll-issue-vertical/">in portrait orientation</a>. The issue is not reproducible in landscape orientation when scrolling, indicating this is a vertical refresh issue. According to the latest rumor, Apple plans to rotate the screen assembly to reduce the jelly scrolling effect in portrait orientation. Whether it will now become more prominent when the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is in landscape orientation is yet to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
The seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is among several devices that Apple could launch this month, the Weibo user goes on to claim. A modified first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> with a USB-C connector instead of Lightning and the sixth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip are also apparently on the table for announcement toward the end of October. After evidence of a refreshed first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with a USB-C connector was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/ios-17-1-apple-pencil-usb-c/">discovered in iOS 17.1 beta code</a>, Instant Digital said that "Apple has not given up on the original &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, and a USB-C version is expected to be coming soon."<br/>
<br/>
The "Instant Digital" account has shared accurate standalone rumors about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">Yellow iPhone 14 spring refresh</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/">frosted back glass</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/">spatial video capture</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and more. That being said, questions remain about how much of the information shared by the user is original or accurate, but until a more long-term track record is established their rumors are worth highlighting.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Setsuna Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">&#039;Jelly Scrolling&#039; Rumored to Be Reduced on iPad Mini 7 Thanks to Rotated Screen Assembly</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jelly-scrolling-rumored-to-be-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7-thanks-to-rotated-screen-assembly.2407432/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is facing an expanded class action lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco by more than three dozen victims allegedly terrorized by stalkers using Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>, reports <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/apple-airtags-triggered-explosion-of-stalking-reports-nationwide-lawsuit-says/">ArsTechnica</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/airtag-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-798036" /><br/>
The complaint targets Apple alleged negligence in allowing &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; to become "one of the most dangerous and frightening technologies employed by stalkers" since they can be easily used used to determine "real-time location information to track victims."<br/>
<br/>
The complaint is a revised version that was brought before a Californian judge in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/06/women-sue-apple-over-airtags/">December 2022</a> by two women, one of which claims her ex-boyfriend used an AirTag to track her without her consent. Since then, plaintiffs allege that there has been an "explosion of reporting" showing that &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; are often used for stalking.<br/>
<br/>
To evidence its claims, the complaint cites more than 150 police reports in the United States as of April 2022, as well as an upsurge in international stalking cases involving &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj;. Plaintiffs argue that Apple has not done enough to reduce potential harms, which they claim can include financial ruin and in extreme cases murder. <br/>
<br/>
There have been multiple news stories about &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; being used for vehicle theft, stalking, and other nefarious purposes, which has led Apple to make several updates to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/10/airtag-updates-unwanted-tracking/">how AirTags work</a> to prevent criminals from taking advantage of them.<br/>
<br/>
When setting up an AirTag, for example, Apple shows warnings to thwart malicious use. The warning makes it clear that the AirTag is linked to an ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>‌, that using it to track people is a crime, and that law enforcement can request identifying information about the owner of the AirTag, which Apple will readily provide.<br/>
<br/>
With an April 2022 software update, Apple made the AirTag sound louder, also to help cut down on stalking attempts. Apple also added safety features that include Precision Finding, improved display alerts, and louder sounds that are designed to make ‌&zwnj;AirTags&zwnj;‌ more difficult to use for people-tracking purposes. Additionally, Apple released the "Tracker Detect" app that allows Android users to scan for &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; to make sure there are none around.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these updates, plaintiffs have alleged that &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; remain dangerous. For instance, one Georgia resident quoted by <em>ArsTechnica</em> reported that she and her daughter were being stalked by someone using &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; within the past two weeks "without knowing by whom or why." Although she cannot locate the &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj;, she receives daily alerts from Apple and chimes from the &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; that confirm that the &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; are still there. These chimes only signal to the victim that she's being perpetually watched. "Every day, I am reminded that me and my daughter are not safe," added the victim in the complaint.<br/>
<br/>
The complaint alleges that Apple violated federal and state laws by negligently releasing a defective product, and has been unjustly enriched while invading the privacy of those victim unwittingly being tracked on its devices. Plaintiffs are seeking damages to all persons in the US who own iOS or Android devices, which includes classes of users who were stalked, as well as those who were allegedly at risk of stalking. <br/>
<br/>
The complaint also seeks a court order "enjoining Apple from further unlawful, unfair, and/or fraudulent practices with respect to the design, manufacture, and release into the market of its &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj;."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to move to dismiss the lawsuit by October 27, the deadline by which the company must respond to the amended complaint.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232">AirTags</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/airtag-lawsuit-widened-stalking-cases/">California AirTag Lawsuit Widened to Include Dozens More Stalking Cases</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/california-airtag-lawsuit-widened-to-include-dozens-more-stalking-cases.2407426/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has already given order commitments to chip supplier TSMC for its second-generation 3nm chip fabrication process known as N3E, which is expected to be used in all four models of next year's iPhone 16 lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
TSMC's next 3nm node upgrade to N3E is less expensive and has improved yield compared to the Taiwanese foundry's first-generation 3nm process, N3B, which made its debut on the smartphone market with the A17 Pro chip that powers Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models. The N3E process also focuses on enhancing chip performance and power consumption. <br/>
<br/>
According to <em>DigiTimes</em>' sources, the foundry house has already moved N3E to volume production, and plans to have the upgraded version replace N3 starting 2024. Except for Samsung, all major chip vendors will embrace N3E, and TSMC has already obtained order commitments from its customers, the largest being Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is receiving all of TSMC's first-generation 3-nanometer process chips this year. As early as May, Apple was known to have booked nearly 90 percent of the foundry's 3nm production for its devices. Apple is now projected to take 100 percent of TSMC's capacity in 2023, due to delays in Intel's wafer needs owing to later modifications to the company's CPU platform design plans.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC is expected to see 4-6 percent of its overall sales in 2023 to come from 3nm manufacturing, thanks to huge orders from Apple for N3B chips for its iPhone 15 devices. Apple alone is expected to contribute as much as &#36;3.4 billion in sales for the foundry this year.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC also plans to move N3P to volume production in the second half of 2024, according to the report. N3P is said to offer an additional boost to N3E with 5 percent more speed at the same leakage, 5-10 percent power reduction at the same speed, and 1.04x more chip density.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips based on TSMC's N3E node, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">according to Jeff Pu</a>, an often-accurate analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with the A16 Bionic chip, so a jump to the A18 chip for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus would be significant.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the iPhone 16 lineup is around a year away from launching, Pu is probably making an educated guess about the marketing names, so it remains to be seen if Apple actually moves forward with A18 and A18 Pro branding.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/apple-obtains-orders-for-iphone-16-tsmc-chips/">iPhone 16 Series Chip Technology Moves to Volume Production</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-series-chip-technology-moves-to-volume-production.2407417/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The new experience provides more detail, improved navigation, custom-designed 3D models of popular landmarks, immersive turn-by-turn walking directions powered by augmented reality, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Look Around, which was first introduced in iOS 13, is also expanding to both countries starting today. Look Around provides 3D street-level imagery in cities where it is available, and it is similar to Google's Street View.<br/>
<br/>
Apple users in the above countries received notifications of the rollout this morning, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> expert Justin O'Beirne also <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps-expansion-20-release">catalogued the expansion</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This is the twentieth time that Apple has expanded its new map data since its public launch in September 2018. It has since expanded to the U.K., Ireland, Canada, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, France, Germany, and select other countries and territories.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/greece/">Greece</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/denmark/">Denmark</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/apple-maps-redesign-expands-denmark-greece/">Apple Maps Redesign Expands to Denmark and Greece</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-redesign-expands-to-denmark-and-greece.2407415/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft's revised offer to buy Activision Blizzard has been approved by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) after its initial acquisition attempt was blocked by the UK antitrust regulator. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/microsoft-purchases-Activision.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833586" /><br/>
Under the revised deal, French video game publisher Ubisoft will be given the rights to distribute Activision's games on consoles and PCs over the cloud.  <br/>
<br/>
The CMA <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/microsoft-concession-a-gamechanger-that-will-promote-competition">said</a> the reworked deal would "preserve competitive prices" in the gaming industry and provide more choice and better services. "We've made sure Microsoft can't have a stranglehold over this important and rapidly developing market," the regulator added. <br/>
<br/>
The approval brings an end to Microsoft's nearly two-year battle to secure the takeover. The company entered into a &#36;68.7 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard in January 2022, but the CMA <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-blocked/">blocked</a> it over concerns it would be anticompetitive in the cloud gaming market.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft was unable to finalize the deal globally until approval was granted.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard was approved by regulators in several other regions and territories including Brazil, Chile, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, South Africa, and most recently, the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
Activision is one of the most popular video games publishers in the world, and the deal represents one of the biggest shake-ups in the games industry in recent history. The studio is the maker of hit titles such as Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft hopes the takeover will boost demand for its Xbox console and allow it to add more titles to its Xbox Game Pass streaming service, where members pay a subscription fee to access a catalog of titles via the cloud.<br/>
<br/>
Xbox Game Pass is available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> through Safari, but not the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. While Apple does allow all-in-one gaming subscription services to be on the platform, every game offered on the service must be submitted individually for approval through the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌ review process.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-to-buy-activision-blizzard/">Microsoft&#039;s &#36;69 Billion Deal to Buy Activision Blizzard Cleared By UK</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsofts-69-billion-deal-to-buy-activision-blizzard-cleared-by-uk.2407413/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Astropad today announced a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> app called <a href="https://astropad.com/slate/">Astropad Slate</a>, which can be used to control the Mac with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>. Astropad Slate is available as a public beta, and because it's still in testing, it is free for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/astropad-slate-ipad.jpg" alt="" width="1999" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916747" /><br/>
There are several Mac functions that can be performed with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. It works as a cursor for controlling the desktop mouse, with a tap on the screen serving as a click. Handwriting done on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will be translated into typed text on the Mac. Astropad Slate supports the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover gestures on newer iPads, and there is a simulated hover option on older iPads, plus you can use two-finger touch gestures for actions like scrolling and zoom.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/872784238?h=548327e593" width="560" height="364" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
You can also use the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as a pen tablet with Mac apps that support drawing, sketching, and other creative work. The Astropad Slate app basically turns the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; into a no-screen drawing tablet so you can focus on your work on the Mac. A Mac and an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can be connected using Wi-Fi, Peer-to-Peer networking, or an appropriate USB cable. Requirements include iPadOS 15 or later and macOS 11 or later.<br/>
<br/>
The Astropad Slate app can be accessed by signing up for the beta <a href="https://astropad.com/slate/">on the Astropad website</a>. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Lighting company <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/">Nanoleaf</a> today announced the launch of new Essentials lights that are aimed at replacing some of the standard bulbs that are installed in ceilings, plus it is introducing a new series of products in partnership with Umbra.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/nanoleaf-downlight.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916707" /><br/>
The <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/essentials/bulbs/?category=GU10&amp;standard=matter&amp;size=3">Essentials Matter GU10</a> and the Essentials Matter Recessed Downlight are compatible with smart home platforms that support Matter, which includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>. The lights can be added to a &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; setup as long as a Matter hub like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> is available. The Essentials lights are also Thread enabled and will integrate with other Thread products for improved connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
Nanoleaf's Recessed Downlights are four inches in size and can replace standard downlights that you may have in your home, while the GU10 bulbs can replace light fixtures that use that bulb style. Like all Nanoleaf Essential lights, the Downlights and GU10 bulbs support 16 million colors as well as a range of different white temperatures.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/nanoleaf-gu10.jpg" alt="" width="3988" height="2243" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916708" /><br/>
The lights can be controlled through the Nanoleaf app or through the Home app when added to &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj;, and can be activated through automations to have lights turn on at specific times or work in tandem with other smart home devices. Multiple bulbs can be grouped together so you can change the lighting in entire rooms at one time.<br/>
<br/>
Nanoleaf today also announced that it is partnering with Umbra on two new Smart Lamps that are compatible with Matter. The Cono Portable Lamp and the Cup Lamp have unique designs created by Umbra with lighting technology supplied by Nanoleaf. The Cono and Cup Lamps work like other Nanoleaf lights, supporting millions of colors and working with scenes, automations, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/cono-lamp-nanoleaf.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916711" /><br/>
The Cono Portable Lamp has a built-in battery that lasts for up to five hours so it can be taken from room to room, while the Cup Lamp is a desktop lamp with a USB charging port and a cup base that is able to hold desk accessories.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated the public-facing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624">vintage and obsolete products list</a> on its website. The page confirms that all first-generation Apple Watch models are now obsolete, as we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/original-apple-watch-now-obsolete/">reported earlier this month</a> based on an internal memo. Obsolete products are no longer eligible for repairs or service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Watch-Series-1-Vintage-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1966" height="1106" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916758" /><br/>
Another addition to the page is the Apple Watch Series 1, which is now classified as vintage. Introduced alongside the Apple Watch Series 2 in September 2016, the Series 1 was a more affordable model that lacked the Series 2's built-in GPS, brighter display, and improved water resistance. It was also only available with an aluminum case, whereas the Series 2 had aluminum, stainless steel, and ceramic case options. In the U.S., the Series 1 started at &#36;269, compared to &#36;369 for the Series 2.<br/>
<br/>
Apple considers a product to be vintage once five years have passed since it was last distributed for sale. Apple discontinued the Series 1 in September 2018 after introducing the Apple Watch Series 4, so that five-year mark has now been reached. Vintage products are no longer guaranteed to be eligible for repairs at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, with service subject to parts availability.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, the Apple Watch SE is the budget model, with pricing starting at &#36;249.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/apple-watch-series-1-vintage/">Remember the Lower-Cost Apple Watch Series 1?

		<description><![CDATA[Apple and its Wi-Fi chip supplier Broadcom have reached an agreement with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), putting an end to a years-long legal battle over wireless communication patents, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-caltech-lawsuit-idCAKBN31C1S5">Reuters</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-Wi-Fi-Chip-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-883034" /><br/>
The terms of the settlement have not been shared, but Caltech will be dropping its lawsuit against Apple and Broadcom with prejudice, preventing Caltech from refiling in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Caltech sued Apple and Broadcom <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/05/30/caltech-vs-apple-broadcom-wifi-lawsuit/">way back in 2016</a>, accusing the two companies of infringing on a series of Wi-Fi patents covering encoding and decoding circuitry for improving data transmission and performance. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Mac, and Apple Watch were all targeted in the suit for using Caltech technology.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/03/apple-countersues-caltech-settles-dot-23/">ended up countersuing</a> in an attempt to have the patents invalidated, a tactic that was unsuccessful. In 2020, a jury decided that Apple and Broadcom had indeed infringed on Caltech's patents, and Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/29/apple-caltech-patent-infringement/">ordered to pay &#36;838 million</a>, while Broadcom was told to pay &#36;270 million.<br/>
<br/>
The two companies combined were ordered to pay &#36;1.1 billion, which would have been one of the largest payouts in U.S. history for a patent dispute. Apple and Broadcom <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/04/apple-dispute-with-caltech-granted-new-trial/">appealed the decision</a>, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ultimately decided that while the two companies had infringed on Caltech patents, the damages award was not justified. The prior court had used a two-tier system to award damages based on different royalty rates, which the appeals court said was "legally unsupportable."<br/>
<br/>
A new trial was ordered, which would recalculate the amount that Apple and Broadcom would need to pay to Caltech. Rather than undergoing a second trial, Apple, Broadcom, and Caltech back in August told the court that a potential settlement was in the works, and now the settlement is official.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/broadcom/">Broadcom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/caltech/">Caltech</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/">Patent Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/apple-caltech-wi-fi-lawsuit-settlement/">Apple Settles 7-Year Wi-Fi Chip Patent Dispute With Caltech</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-settles-7-year-wi-fi-chip-patent-dispute-with-caltech.2407352/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be equipped with Qualcomm's latest cellular modem, according to technology analyst Jeff Pu, enabling faster and more power efficient 5G connectivity for the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913688" /><br/>
In a research note this week with investment firm Haitong International Securities, Pu said the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be equipped with <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/technology/modems/snapdragon-x75-5g-modem-rf-system">Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 modem</a>. However, he expects the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to retain the Snapdragon X70 modem used for the entire iPhone 15 lineup. Apple has typically used the same Qualcomm modem across all models for each generation of iPhones, excluding the low-end iPhone SE, so this would be a change in strategy for the company.<br/>
<br/>
Announced in February 2023, the Snapdragon X75 features improved carrier aggregation and other technology advancements for faster 5G download and upload speeds compared to the X70. The modem's combined mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G transceiver takes up 25% less circuit board space, and uses up to 20% less power, according <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23600171/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem-rf">to <em>The Verge</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Snapdragon X75 also supports the latest "5G Advanced" standard, which is described as "the next phase of 5G" and an "evolution towards 6G." 5G Advanced will include artificial intelligence and machine learning enhancements for improved 5G performance, and it will also expand 5G to additional types of devices and use cases.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is likely to market the iPhone 16 Pro models as featuring "5G Advanced," much like the iPhone 6s gained support for "LTE Advanced" in 2015.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to have been working on its own 5G modem for iPhones since 2018, but the project has reportedly faced development challenges, and the modem is not expected to be announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-modem-in-2025-kuo/">until 2025 or later</a> should it ever materialize. In the meantime, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/apple-extends-deal-with-qualcomm-as-modem-delayed/">extended its 5G modem agreement with Qualcomm</a> through 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Apple should announce the iPhone 16 lineup in September 2024, so there is still plenty of time remaining until the devices launch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-5g-advanced-rumor/">iPhone 16 Pro Expected to Support &#039;5G Advanced&#039; With Qualcomm&#039;s Snapdragon X75 Modem</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-expected-to-support-5g-advanced-with-qualcomms-snapdragon-x75-modem.2407339/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhones will not adopt resin coated copper (RCC) foil for their printed circuit boards until 2025, <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/最快需至2025年iphone主板才會採用rcc材料-it-will-take-until-2025-at-the-earliest-for-the-iphone-mainboard-to-61abc0d30883">according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo says that Apple will not adopt this technology in 2024 because of its "fragile characteristics" and "inability to pass drop tests."<br/>
<br/>

If Apple and its supplier Ajinomoto can improve the RCC material before the third quarter of 2024, the high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 models could use it. Resin coated copper does not sound exciting, but it has the potential to slim down the size of circuit boards, freeing up space inside of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that can be used for larger batteries or other technology. Kuo says that it also makes the drilling process easier for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; manufacturing because RCC is fiberglass-free.<br/>
<br/>
Late last month, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-looking-to-save-space-with-thinner-pcbs/">Weibo circuit expert</a> claimed that Apple would adopt RCC for circuit boards starting in 2024, but it appears that we might not see the shift until 2025.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/rcc-thinner-circuit-boards-2025/">Kuo: iPhones Won&#039;t Adopt RCC for Thinner Circuit Boards Until 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphones-wont-adopt-rcc-for-thinner-circuit-boards-until-2025.2407338/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days event has ended, many of the week's best sales have expired. However, we're tracking a few Apple products that remain at their best-ever prices even after the end of the sale, including the AirPods 2, 15-inch MacBook Air, and 9th generation iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/last-minute-prime-day.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916640" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
<h2>15-Inch MacBook Air</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/15inch-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916649" /><br/>
<br/>
An overall highlight of Prime Day has been a &#36;250 discount across the entire 15-inch M2 MacBook Air lineup, and all of these sales are still around. The 256GB model is down to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75NSLJY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;1,049.00</strong></a> and the 512GB model is down to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C76D4RWJ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,249.00</strong></a>, and both are record low prices.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75NSLJY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;250 OFF</div>15-Inch MacBook Air for &#36;1,049.00</div></a></div><h2>AirPods</h2><br/>

<br/>
There were quite a few AirPods deals earlier in the week, but the only notable deal that has stuck around is on the AirPods 2. You can get these earbuds for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;89.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00, which is one of the lowest prices of the year and an overall second-bet price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;40 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for &#36;89.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you're still shopping for the newest model of the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, there is a sale on this model, it's just not at its all-time low Prime Day price. You can pick up these earbuds for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00, which is still a good deal on the newest model of AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;199.99</div></a></div><h2>iPad</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ipad-purple-prime-day.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916648" /><br/>
<br/>
The major iPad deal that has stuck around post-Prime Day is on the 9th generation iPad (64GB Wi-Fi), which is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;249.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;329.00. This is a match of the best price we've ever tracked on the tablet, and the 256GB Wi-Fi option is on sale too, just not at a record low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;80 OFF</div>iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for 249.00</div></a></div><h2>Anker</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week published a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213680">support document</a> with some valuable tips for buying a preowned iPhone online or in person.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/iphoneseblack.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-737527" /><br/>
Apple starts off by touting that the iPhone "lasts longer than other smartphones," making a preowned iPhone a "great way to own an iPhone." Apple says it provides "industry-leading device support for software updates," although Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/software-support-pixel-8-pixel-8-pro/">recently announced</a> that its latest Pixel 8 phones will receive full Android updates for seven years, whereas iOS 17 only supports iPhone models released up to five years ago.<br/>
<br/>
When buying a preowned iPhone online, it is very important to choose a trusted seller, as the device cannot be physically inspected at the time of purchase. If possible, make sure the iPhone is not Activation Locked, as this would prevent you from using the device unless you know the previous owner's Apple ID and password.<br/>
<br/>
For in-person purchases, Apple shared a helpful checklist for inspecting a preowned iPhone. Apple explains how to check for damage, how to find out if parts have been replaced, how to view the battery's health, how to find out if the iPhone is locked to a carrier, how to ensure hardware like the camera and microphone are functional, and more.<br/>
<br/>
While some of the tips are obvious, Apple's support document might be worth bookmarking if you plan to buy a used iPhone in the future.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/apple-preowned-iphone-checklist/">Apple Shares Checklist With Important Tips for Buying a Used iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-checklist-with-important-tips-for-buying-a-used-iphone.2407322/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will release its first MacBooks based on TSMC's 3nm fabrication process in 2024, not this year as some rumors have suggested. That's according to a new five-year global notebook shipments forecast published by <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231011VL209/digitimes-research-2023-notebook-shipments.html">DigiTimes</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/m3-feature-black.jpg" alt="" width="1810" height="1018" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-827879" /><br/>
Predicting an end to a two-year decline in the notebook market, the report forecasts a 4.7% shipment growth in 2024 driven by the easing of inflation and the introduction of new products, including new MacBooks powered by 3nm-based chips. From the report:<br/>
<blockquote>In 2023, the share of notebooks built using Arm-based processors will likely decrease rather than increase because Apple, which adopts in-house designed Arm-based CPUs for most of its notebook lineups, is expected to experience a significant decline in shipments in 2023 as the US brand vendor plans to transit to CPUs built by a 3nm node at TSMC for performance upgrading in 2024.</blockquote>In July, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said October of this year could see the announcement of the first Macs with the M3 chip. Given that Apple launched new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models in January, and more recently new 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, ‌Mac Studio‌, and ‌Mac Pro‌ models in June, Gurman said the first beneficiaries of the new M3 chip would likely be the next ‌iMac‌, 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, and 13-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
However, more recently in September, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">said</a> that it seemed Apple will not launch new MacBook models with M3 series chips before the end of this year. Kuo only ruled out new MacBooks though, which appears to leave open the possibility of a new iMac coming this year. The current model featuring the M1 chip has now been on sale for over two and a half years.<br/>
<br/>
<em>DigiTimes</em> itself recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/new-14-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-2023/">suggested</a> Apple would make a MacBook Pro announcement before the holidays. The Taiwan-based outlet earlier this month claimed Apple is preparing to ship new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with more power-efficient mini-LED displays before the year is out. That report did not mention the processor the models would be based on, but Gurman has previously said the next version of these two machines will feature M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, and that they will "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">probably</a>" launch by the middle of 2024 at the latest. <br/>

The as-yet-unannounced M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated with TSMC's 3nm process for performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the current 5nm-based ‌M2‌ chip, which debuted in June 2022. It will also likely feature an all new GPU with hardware ray-tracing, first introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro's A17 Pro chip last month.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/apple-first-m3-macbooks-in-2024/">Apple&#039;s First M3 MacBooks Coming Next Year, Claims Shipment Forecast</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-m3-macbooks-coming-next-year-claims-shipment-forecast.2407293/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There appears to be a curious phenomenon that is causing some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models to turn off temporarily at night, which can interrupt alarms and other &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-passcode-green.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886806" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/175dic1/2_different_iphones_alarms_didnt_go_off_this/">thread on Reddit</a>, a user complains that two separate &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; alarms in his home failed to go off. Several other users also chimed in with similar issues, and it turns out that some of the issues could be linked to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; turning off at night. From Reddit:<blockquote>Hijacking top comment. Check your battery settings and see if there is a gap during the night. Yesterday a lot of iPhones turned off for a few hours during the night. In my case the phone turned back on 1 minute before the alarm</blockquote>Some other people noted having to put in their passcodes in the morning, an indication that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; restarted or shut off during the night. <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/10/iphone-restart-overnight/">9to5Mac</a></em> highlighted these issues earlier this week, and we've also experienced the problem here at <em>MacRumors</em>, as have <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphones-spontaneously-rebooted-last-night.2407082/">multiple users on the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>. From <em>MacRumors</em>:<blockquote>So my iPhone 15 Pro Max with iOS 17.0.3 spontaneously rebooted last night (10. October around 01:00 AM CET). The same happened to 3 of my friends with the same iPhone and same iOS, and to someone else with an iPhone 13 Mini, also on the same iOS.</blockquote>You can tell if your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; turned off at night by opening up the Settings app, navigating to Battery, and checking the charging status over the past 24 hours. If there's a gap, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was turned off for a period of time.<br/>
<br/>
The problem affects <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, but it is also impacting other devices, suggesting that it's something in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. Not all users are experiencing the shutdown issues, nor does it appear to be happening every night.<br/>
<br/>
It is not yet clear what is going on, and Apple has not commented.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/iphone-models-turning-off-at-night/">Some iPhone Models Mysteriously Shutting Off at Night</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-iphone-models-mysteriously-shutting-off-at-night.2407266/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple-Backed Right to Repair Bill Signed Into Law in California</title>

		<description><![CDATA[California this week officially adopted new right to repair legislation, with California Governor Gavin Newsom this week <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/10/10/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-10-10-23/">signing SB 244 into law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895789" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Self-Service-Repair-Program-iPhone.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
The Right to Repair law requires companies to provide customers with the tools to diagnose and repair consumer electronics and appliances. Apple in August sent a letter urging California to adopt the bill, despite the fact that Apple has lobbied against other Right to Repair legislation.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already launched a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/">Self Service Repair program</a> for iPhones and Macs, with the repair program providing customers with repair kits, repair manuals, and components for repairs. Apple also has repair programs for independent repair shops, such as the Apple Authorized Service Provider option and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/29/apple-independent-repair-program/">Independent Repair Provider program</a>.<br/>
<br/>
California's law requires service and repair facilities that are not authorized repair providers to disclose whether they're using replacement parts that are not from the device manufacturer, which would prevent Apple repair stores from using non-Apple parts without making that explicitly clear. As legitimate repair parts must come from Apple, the repair law in California is to Apple's benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Manufacturers are also not required to make tools, parts, and documentation available for any component that would disable or override antitheft security measures, which encompasses Apple features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Independent repair shops have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/06/apple-independent-repair-shops-contracts/">in the past complained</a> that Apple forces them to sign invasive contracts, and the kits that Apple sells for self-service repair are not much more affordable than simply getting a repair direct from Apple, but California's law does ensure that customers have options other than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
SB 244 requires that Apple and other companies provide components, repair manuals, and other repair information to be available for seven years after the sale of any product that costs more than &#36;99.99. It is applicable to products sold after July 1, 2021.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/california/">California</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/right-to-repair/">Right to Repair</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/california-right-to-repair-law/">Apple-Backed Right to Repair Bill Signed Into Law in California</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-backed-right-to-repair-bill-signed-into-law-in-california.2407256/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[T-Mobile will be forcing customers on older smartphone plans to move to newer, more expensive plans, according to information that has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174uelk/megathread_forced_plan_migration_for_older_plans/">shared on Reddit</a>. The migration will be automatic, but customers can contact support to ask to opt out of the migration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/t-mobile-logo-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893072" /><br/>
Those who had the prior Magenta and One plans will be upgraded to Go5G, while those on the Magenta 55+ plan will be upgraded to Go5G+. Simple Choice and Select Choice users will be moved to Magenta or Essentials Select.<br/>
<br/>
With these migrations to new plans, customers will see price increases of &#36;5 to &#36;10 per line depending on current plan. Those on the Simple/Select Choice plans, for example, will see a &#36;10 per line price increase.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who miss the notification about the upcoming plan changes can still ask to revert back for a short period, though customer service will attempt to push customers to new plans with one-time credits.<br/>
<br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://tmo.report/2023/10/breaking-t-mobile-will-force-customers-onto-newer-plans-unless-you-opt-out/">The Mobile Report</a></em>, customer support representatives will attempt to convince users about the benefits of the new plan. "We are not raising the price of any of your plans; we are moving you to a newer plan with more benefits at a different cost," T-Mobile instructs employees to say.<br/>
<br/>
Customers will begin receiving notifications about the upcoming plan changes on October 17, both through text messages and emails. Migration timing will vary based on bill cycle.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/t-mobile-plan-migration/">T-Mobile Automatically Upgrading Users to More Expensive Plans, But There&#039;s an Opt-Out Option</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-automatically-upgrading-users-to-more-expensive-plans-but-theres-an-opt-out-option.2407252/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Both Apple and Google came out with new high-end flagship smartphones this autumn, debuting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max and the Pixel 8 Pro, respectively. As with any expensive smartphone, the cameras in both produce amazing images, but there are some notable differences that can be seen in our comparison video and article.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RdKdQ_bMW4c" title="Camera Comparison: Google Pixel 8 Pro vs iPhone 15 Pro Max" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max has a triple-lens camera system with 48-megapixel Main (wide) camera that can be set to three focal lengths, a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and a 12-megapixel Telephoto lens that supports up to 5x optical zoom. The Pixel 8 Pro also has a triple-lens camera system with 50-megapixel Wide camera, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and a 48-megapixel Telephoto camera also with 5x optical zoom.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-3.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916454" /><br/>
The Google and Apple camera systems have similarities in available lenses and technologies like portrait mode, night mode, HDR, and more, but there are different software algorithms that are at work under the hood, and that's what brings in some of the biggest differences that we're seeing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-9.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916455" /><br/>
When it comes to landscape images that show a lot of sky, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max looks more natural. The colors are more accurate and the differences between sky and cloud are more pronounced for an overall better looking image. The Pixel 8 Pro trends toward a more blue tint for sky images, and it also has a tendency to overexpose in some shots. You'll also notice that the Pixel photos tend to be brighter, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> photos are downright moody.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-10.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916456" /><br/>
There are definite themes to color temperature, saturation, exposure, and other factors. Several of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max images feel oversaturated compared to the Pixel 8 Pro, with Apple giving deeper blacks and more vibrant colors, while Google's images have a brighter feel with contrast bumped down. In the taxi image, for example, the cars were not that shade of yellow that Apple produced, but both images look good and choosing a favorite will depend on whether you prefer images that are more saturated or brighter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-11.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916457" /><br/>
Apple's 5x Telephoto lens is limited to 12 megapixels and it does not have the wide aperture of the Main lens, so it should not be a surprise that the images that come out of it look different in terms of sharpness and saturation. 5x images from the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max and the Pixel 8 Pro look similar in most instances, but the Pixel 8 Pro seems to have more pronounced textures because the images are brighter with the contrast bumped up a bit more than what we're getting with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-15.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916458" /><br/>
Apple's 5x zoom lens has an edge when it comes to portrait mode because it can capture 5x portraits, while the Pixel is limited to 2x portraits. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; really wins out in terms of background blur, and even in portraits with other lenses, Apple is doing better with color, skin tone, and blur. The Pixel's portrait images sometimes come out better in situations with lower light.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-18.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916459" /><br/>
As for night shots, iPhones have always been a bit ahead in terms of a natural look, and that hasn't changed. The nighttime images from the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are more true to life, while the Pixel 8 Pro is much brighter and doesn't have the same nighttime mood.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-16.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916460" /><br/>
Apple's video stabilization has always been tough to beat, and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max produces better video than you get with the Pixel 8 Pro. Google has caught up somewhat with its latest smartphones, but Apple remains a step ahead. For pros, Apple also has an option for ProRes Log recording, so you can record a flat image that can be used with custom LUTs in post-processing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/phone-15-pro-max-vs-pixel-22.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916461" /><br/>
Google has added some fun AI features to its camera that Apple can't compete with. Best Take, for example, sorts through multiple group photos that have been captured and finds the best shot. You can go change each person's face, swapping in from another in the series so that each person is smiling and looking at the camera. Magic Editor lets you erase objects in an image and uses generative AI to fill in the blank spot, and the Audio Magic Eraser can pull out unwanted sounds.<br/>
<br/>
