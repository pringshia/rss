		<description><![CDATA[Apple's 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE has dropped to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8RVB8%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a> today on Amazon, down from &#36;249.00. This is just &#36;10 higher compared to its all-time low price on the wearable. This deal is available in the Silver Aluminum Case with Winter Blue Sport Loop and Starlight Aluminum Case with Starlight Sport Loop, and only Amazon has the discount.<br/>
<br/>

This is another near all-time low price that's just &#36;10 away from the lowest price on the Apple Watch SE, and it's available in Silver and Starlight Aluminum options.<br/>

This model of the Apple Watch SE launched in September 2022 and remains Apple's most affordable Apple Watch. The Apple Watch SE lacks some of the upgraded features you'll find in some Series 9 or Ultra 2 models, like temperature sensing and ECG functionality, but it will otherwise provide you with all key Apple Watch features, and at the cheapest price possible.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Canva has <a href="https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/affinity/">acquired</a> Serif's Affinity suite of creative apps, marking a significant stride in its competition against Adobe with a deal valued at several hundred million dollars (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/canva-acquires-affinity-design-suite-in-push-to-rival-adobe"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>

Canva is an Australian online design company valued at &#36;26 billion. Its platform offers user-friendly design tools aimed at non-professionals and has a user base of over 175 million people worldwide. The acquisition of the Affinity apps marks a change of strategy for Canva, targeting professional designers and creatives who have traditionally relied on Adobe's suite of products.<br/>
<br/>
Affinity's software, encompassing photo editing, vector illustration, and desktop publishing tools, has been been lauded for its performance, affordability, and one-time purchase model â€“ a stark contrast to Adobe's subscription services. The apps have garnered a strong following among Mac users in particular.<br/>
<br/>
The acquisition includes the transition of Serif's 90-person team to Canva, ensuring continuity in the development and support of Affinity apps. Cliff Obrecht, Canva's co-founder and Chief Operating Officer, emphasized that Affinity's portfolio is the "final piece in our jigsaw," indicating how the apps are expected to complement Canva's existing array of AI-powered design solutions and collaborative online workspaces.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/affinity-photo/">Affinity Photo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/affinity-designer/">Affinity Designer</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/affinity-publisher/">Affinity Publisher</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/canva-acquires-affinity-apps/">Canva Acquires Serif&#039;s Affinity Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/canva-acquires-serifs-affinity-apps.2422854/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chinese tech giant Tencent has agreed to make some of its most important apps available on Apple's Vision Pro headset ahead of its launch in the country later this year, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-vision-pro-gets-boost-from-chinas-media-kingmaker"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-vision-pro-eye.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-922615" /><br/>
Tencent is one of the biggest multimedia companies in the world and its apps and services are ubiquitous in China. It owns Weibo, WeChat, QQ, WeBank, Tencent Pictures, and games such as Honor of Kings and PUBG. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> and many other entertainment services such as Disney+ are not available in China. "Without Tencent's contribution, Apple would have faced a greater challenge in marketing the Vision Pro in China," the report explains, calling the company's move "critical" to the device's success in the country.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> confirmed that the Vision Pro will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/vision-pro-to-launch-in-china-this-year/">launch in China this year</a>. It is likely to be more expensive in China due to import taxes and could even be marketed under a different name due to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/vision-pro-trademark-issues-in-china/">trademark dispute with Huawei</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also apparently seeking Chinese partners to help it launch and run &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, and Apple Fitness+ in the country. The company has not launched any new services in China since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> in 2017 due to government restrictions.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/chinese-apps-coming-to-vision-pro/">&#039;Critical&#039; Chinese Apps Coming to Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/critical-chinese-apps-coming-to-apple-vision-pro.2422850/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At least one accessory maker is already preparing for the iPhone 16's rumored Capture button, according to an <a href="https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/1772507715694203055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1772507715694203055%7Ctwgr%5E5e7be999487209a61c674e1803ad1f7e3ce7e390%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrumors.com%2F2024%2F03%2F26%2Fiphone-16-pro-case-with-capture-button-cutout%2F">image shared today by Sonny Dickson</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-16-Side-New-Action-Button-Emphasis-Bump.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917543" /><br/>
Dickson showed off a third-party iPhone 16 Pro case that includes a cutout below the power button on the right edge, which is where the Capture button is expected to be located. It is unclear if the accessory maker has direct knowledge of the new button, or if it is simply aware of the rumor, but it is betting on the change happening.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> was first to report about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">Apple's plans to add a Capture button</a> to all iPhone 16 models launching later this year. The button reportedly provides <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">quick access to various camera controls</a> for capturing photos and video. Specifically, it was reported that users will be able to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus on a subject with a light press, and start a video recording with a more forceful press.<br/>
<br/>
The button's touch sensitivity, and the fact it is expected to sit flush with the frame, explains why the case has a cutout for the button instead of covering it.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Sonny-Dickson-iPhone-16-Pro-Case.jpeg" alt="" width="2166" height="1020" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943423" /><em>Image Credit: Sonny Dickson</em></div><br/>
The new button would be ideally positioned on the top edge of iPhone 16 models when recording horizontal video, providing users with an easy-to-reach shutter button. The volume buttons currently serve this purpose when the Camera app is open.<br/>
<br/>
The location of the Capture button will require the mmWave 5G antenna window to be moved to the bottom-left edge on iPhone 16 models sold in the U.S., below the volume buttons. This antenna window does not exist in any other countries, as international models of the iPhone 12 through iPhone 15 are limited to sub-6 GHz 5G.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 16 series in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonny-dickson/">Sonny Dickson</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/iphone-16-pro-case-with-capture-button-cutout/">iPhone 16: Accessory Maker Prepares for All-New Capture Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-accessory-maker-prepares-for-all-new-capture-button.2422849/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Images comparing purportedly accurate dummy models of the iPhone 16 series have been <a href="https://weibo.com/6315816381/O6DBOij3C?pagetype=profilefeed">shared online</a>, providing a closer look at the rumored design of the upcoming devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-16-dummies.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943358" /><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-16-preliminary-weights-dimensions/">larger display sizes</a> this year, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/">multiple sources</a>, while the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will be the same size as the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-16-pro-v-iphone-15-pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1290" height="1290" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943364" /><br/>
The first images show the difference in size between the iPhone 16 Pro and last year's iPhone 15 Pro. The iPhone 16 Pro is said to have a 6.3-inch display, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max will have a 6.9-inch display. In contrast, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max have 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-16-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="366" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943370" /><br/>
Additional images give a better idea of button placement. Apple plans to replace the Mute Switch on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus with the Action button that was previously exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro models. However, the images suggest the Action button will be larger than the one found on the current Pro devices.<br/>
<br/>
It's also worth noting the rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">redesigned rear camera bump</a> on the iPhone 16 dummy. The pill-shaped bump houses the separate Wide and Ultrawide lenses on both the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. The microphone sits next to the lenses, while the camera flash is located on the back of the device outside of the bump.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-16-action-button.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="575" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943366" /><br/>
In addition, all four iPhone 16 models are expected to feature an entirely new button that will be used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/">taking photos and videos</a>. The so-called "Capture button" is located on the same side of the iPhone as the Power button, in the space currently occupied by the 5G mmWave antenna in the United States. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-16-capture-button.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="711" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943371" /><br/>
In the images, the Capture button appears to be almost flush with the iPhone 16 chassis, but rumors say it will be mechanical rather than capacitive. Either way, <em>The Information</em> says that the button will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">respond to pressure and touch</a>. Apple believes the new button will be a major selling point for the â€ŒiPhone 16â€Œ lineup, and it is being introduced to further push the â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ as a camera alternative for shooting horizontal video.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release the iPhone 16 lineup in September.

		<description><![CDATA[Philips Hue parent company Signify today announced an expanded relationship with Samsung, bringing the Philips Hue Sync TV app to additional countries, adding a Music Mode, and introducing a monthly subscription option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/samsung-philips-hue-sync.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943281" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/04/ces-2023-philips-hue-sync-samsung-tvs/">As of last year</a>, Samsung TV owners have been able to download a Philips Hue Sync app that allows Samsung smart TVs to be linked to HomeKit-connected Hue bulbs and lighting products. With the integration, content played on Samsung TVs is synced to the lighting in the room.<br/>
<br/>
When the feature launched, it was priced at &#36;130 for Samsung TV owners, but starting this spring, there will be a lower-priced subscription option. Customers can choose to pay a monthly fee of &#36;2.99 to use the Hue Sync app on up to three TVs, or a one-time fee to unlock it on a single TV. The Philips Hue Sync TV app is launching in Brazil, Hong Kong, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, so Samsung TV owners in those countries can use the functionality.<br/>
<br/>
On compatible 2024 Samsung TV models, there is a new Music Mode option that allows the lights to react to the audio of what's playing on TV rather than the content of the screen. It is compatible with any music played on the TV, and will also be coming to Samsung TVs made in 2022 and 2023 later this year.<br/>
<br/>
For those without Samsung TVs, the &#36;250 Hue Play HDMI Sync Box paired with a streaming device like an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> is the only way to get TV content that's synced to lights, so the Samsung TV app provides a simpler solution for those who have Samsung TVs.<br/>
<br/>
The Philips Hue Sync TV app is available for Samsung Q60 series or higher QLED TVs that were made in 2022 or later.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/">Philips Hue</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/samsung-philips-hue-subscription-sync-app/">Philips Hue Sync TV App for Samsung TVs Gets Subscription Option and Music Mode</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-sync-tv-app-for-samsung-tvs-gets-subscription-option-and-music-mode.2422845/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has yet to reach a generative AI partnership with Chinese company Baidu, according to a <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202403/26/WS6602b2c1a31082fc043bec68.html"><em>China Daily</em></a> report citing sources familiar with the matter. Some earlier reports said the two companies had finalized an agreement <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/">following discussions</a>. It is possible that the negotiations are still ongoing, but this is not confirmed.<br/>
<br/>

If the partnership does happen, Baidu would likely power some of iOS 18's rumored generative AI features in China only. Generative AI models must receive approval from the Chinese government, and Baidu's Ernie chatbot is permitted in the country. Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbots are not available in China.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly held similar generative AI partnership discussions <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-iphone-ai-talks-google-openai-ongoing/">with Google and OpenAI</a> for the U.S. market, and likely other countries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has repeatedly teased that it has generative AI announcements <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">to share later this year</a>, and this likely refers to iOS 18. The software update is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">rumored to include new generative AI features</a> for a range of iPhone features and apps, including Siri, Spotlight, Apple Music, Health, Messages, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, Shortcuts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 will be previewed at Apple's developers conference <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC</a> in June, so we're just a few months away from learning about the company's plans.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-baidu-partnership-reportedly-not-reached-yet/">iOS 18 Rumor: Apple and Baidu &#039;Yet to Reach&#039; Generative AI Partnership</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumor-apple-and-baidu-yet-to-reach-generative-ai-partnership.2422843/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models will come in new "space black" and "rose" titanium colors, claims a new rumor out of China.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iphone-16-pro-colors-graybg.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937186" /><br/>
According to a Weibo post <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1772522408144191732?s=20">shared by leaker ShrimpApplePro on X</a> (Twitter), the Blue Titanium color that iPhone 15 Pro models are currently available in will be dropped from the iPhone 16 Pro lineup in favor of the new rose color. Meanwhile, "space black," which is said to be similar to the iPhone 14 Pro color of the same name, will replace Black Titanium.<br/>
<br/>
The rumor also claims that the Natural and White Titanium colors will be slightly different on the iPhone 16 Pro models. Natural Titanium is said to be returning, but with more of a gray tint to it. Meanwhile, White Titanium will appear more like a "silver white" color, which is also said to be similar to the silver version of the iPhone 14 Pro. <br/>
<br/>
The Weibo user that is the source of the rumor has not previously been tracked by <em>MacRumors</em>. However, ShrimpApplePro claims that the account accurately predicted ahead of launch the Purple color that debuted with the iPhone 14 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Apple switched its "Pro" models from stainless steel to titanium with last year's iPhone 15 Pro series. The iPhone 15 Pro comes in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium, and Natural Titanium, but Apple surprised by not offering a gold option. Gold was available through the â€Œâ€ŒiPhoneâ€Œâ€Œ 5S to the â€Œâ€ŒiPhoneâ€Œâ€Œ 8, and then on the â€Œâ€ŒiPhoneâ€Œâ€Œ XS to the â€Œâ€ŒiPhone 14â€Œâ€Œ Pro. Therefore the rumored new "rose" color could well be the titanium version of a gold-like shade.<br/>

This is the second rumor we have heard about the â€ŒiPhone 16 Proâ€Œ's color options. Last month, the leaker known as "Majin Bu" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-16-pro-two-new-color-options/">claimed</a> that the Pro models would be available in "Desert Titanium" and "Titanium Gray" color options, and those names suggest there could be some overlap with today's rumored rose color and the tweaked Natural Titanium.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shrimpapplepro/">ShrimpApplePro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/iphone-16-pro-new-space-black-rose-colors/">iPhone 16 Pro Could Come in New &#039;Space Black&#039; and &#039;Rose&#039; Colors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-could-come-in-new-space-black-and-rose-colors.2422839/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On March 21, the United States Justice Department <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-sued-by-us-department-of-justice/">sued Apple for antitrust violations</a>, concluding a multi-year investigation into Apple's business practices. The U.S. government is also pursuing antitrust cases against Google, Amazon, and Meta, as part of an expansive look into the practices of major tech companies.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-vs-DOJ-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943221" /><br/>
Apple plans to "vigorously defend" against the DoJ's lawsuit, which seeks to fundamentally change the way that Apple operates. This will be a legal battle that spans multiple years, and we'll keep this guide updated with the latest news as the case progresses.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="dojs_claims">DoJ's Claims</h2><br/>
The lawsuit that the DoJ filed against Apple is broad ranging, and rather than focusing on one or two issues, it aims to establish a long-running history of anti-competitive behavior. The DoJ tries to establish a pattern of business decisions that have suppressed competition, with the DoJ arguing that Apple has time and time again opted to "make its products worse for consumers to prevent competition from emerging."<br/>
<br/>
It is the opinion of the DoJ that Apple has gotten consumers "hooked" on its platform through these choices, making it unreasonably difficult for customers to switch to another smartphone brand. There is no allowance made for customer preference and the idea that people simply like their iPhones - the DoJ positions Apple as a monopolist that has manipulated people into sticking with its ecosystem by blocking competing apps, services, and products.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="suppressing_technologies">Suppressing Technologies</h3><br/>
While the full lawsuit details a long list of ways Apple has allegedly harmed consumers, the DoJ cites five specific examples of Apple blocking technologies that it claims would decrease barriers to switching and give consumers a "higher-quality user experience on any smartphone."<br/>
<br/>
The DoJ is of the opinion that if Apple did not historically limit cloud gaming, digital wallets, and non-Apple Watch smartwatches, that people would freely choose to purchase less expensive alternative smartphones over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The DoJ believes that Apple is not facing pressure from "innovative, cross-platform technologies" because Apple "makes other products worse" rather than making its own products better.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Super apps</strong> - The DoJ defines super apps as those that provide a user with "broad functionality" in a single app and have the benefit of providing a consistent user experience across devices. An example of a super app is WeChat, which is widely used in China for communicating, making payments, and more. The DoJ says that Apple has "denied users access to super apps" in the U.S., but it is worth noting that there is a cultural aspect to these apps, and they just haven't caught on in the U.S. the way they have in China. Mini apps are often frequently referenced too, as Apple did have restrictions on apps offering mini games and other multi-app features (these restrictions were eliminated in iOS 17.4).</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Cloud streaming</strong> - The DoJ suggests that Apple is suppressing cloud streaming games by preventing them from being available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Cloud streaming apps have been usable on Safari, and as of iOS 17.4, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/apple-allows-cloud-gaming-apps-on-app-store/">changed its rules</a> to allow streaming game apps like Xbox Cloud Gaming to offer streaming games through a single &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; app. This argument is no longer entirely relevant, but the DoJ believes that by not allowing cloud gaming apps, Apple prevented consumers from buying cheaper phones. The idea here is that customers had to opt in to expensive iPhones to play "high-compute" games because they weren't available to play using cloud services.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Messaging apps</strong> - The DoJ thinks that third-party apps should be able to send and receive SMS messages, rather than these messages being routed to the Messages app. This would let users switch phones without changing the way they communicate. The filing takes issue with the lack of an iMessage app for Android, Apple's efforts to block the Beeper Mini app, green bubbles, and the adoption of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Smartwatches</strong> - Apple suppresses key functions of third-party smartwatches, preventing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users from getting Apple Watch-like functionality from smartwatches with "better user interfaces and services." The DoJ says that Apple locks customers in to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with the Apple Watch, because the Apple Watch can't be used on other smartphones. A user who wants to switch from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; must also purchase an Android-compatible smartwatch.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Digital Wallets</strong> - Apple does not let banking apps access NFC and provide digital payments services, and customers are not able to choose their "trusted banking apps" as their digital wallet. Apple also prevents developers from creating cross-platform wallets that would make it easier to switch from &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to Android, and alternative wallets could also be used for in-app purchases. The DoJ claims that the payments that banks make to Apple for using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> would otherwise be used for features and benefits for smartphone users.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="privacy_and_security">Privacy and Security</h3><br/>
The DoJ suggests that Apple justifies its anticompetitive conduct with privacy and security concerns.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Apple spends billions on marketing to promote "the self-serving premise that only Apple can safeguard consumers' privacy and security interests."</li><br/>
 <li>Apple selectively compromises privacy and security interests when it is in Apple's financial interest. The examples used here include the lack of end-to-end encryption between Android and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; messages and the making Google the default browser engine when "more private options" are available.</li><br/>
 <li>The safe, secure experience on Mac is evidence that Apple's control over app distribution and creation is "substantially more restrictive than necessary to protect user privacy and security."</li><br/>
 <li>Apple makes the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; less secure if that helps it maintain monopoly power. The DoJ cites unencrypted text messages sent from iPhones to Android phones as an example. "If Apple wanted to," it could let &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users send encrypted messages to Android users.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="the_app_store">The App Store</h3><br/>
The DoJ mentions Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; policies and fees, but it is not the main focus of the lawsuit. While the DoJ was preparing its case, the Apple vs. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> lawsuit took place, and Apple was found not to have a mobile gaming monopoly. That undoubtedly influenced the DoJ filing, but there is wording here<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Apple uses &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules to "extract monopoly rents" from third-party developers.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple prohibits the creation and use of alternative app stores, and has arbitrary enforcement of its own &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules.</li><br/>
 <li>Developers are not able to offer web apps as an alternative to &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; apps because &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users "do not look for or know how to find web apps."</li><br/>
 <li>Apple uses &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules and restrictions to penalize and restrict developers that threaten its monopoly. It does allow apps to use private APIs, and requires web browsers to use WebKit.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple's efforts to restrict super apps and cloud streaming apps may have slowed the development of innovative apps related to education, artificial intelligence, and productivity. It has also kept app developers for creating features prohibited by Apple on other platforms.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="iphone_cost_and_development">iPhone Cost and Development</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Apple inflates the price for buying and using iPhones.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple spent more than twice as much on stock buybacks and dividends as it did on research and development (&#36;30B vs. &#36;77B in fiscal 2023).</li><br/>
 <li>Apple slowed down innovation on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to extract revenue from customers using subscriptions and cloud services.</li><br/>
 <li>Powerful, expensive hardware is unnecessary if consumers can play games through cloud streaming apps.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3 id="services">Services</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Apple's subscription services increase the cost of switching from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to another smartphone. The DoJ references <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, Apple's cloud storage, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a>+ because these are exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. This results in "significant frictions" for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who want to switch.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple uses its "rapidly expanding" role as a TV and movie producer to control content and affect the "flow of speech."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3 id="green_bubbles_and_imessage">"Green Bubbles" and iMessage</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>By using green bubbles, Apple "signals to users" that rival smartphones are lower quality because the experience of messaging non-iPhone users is worse. The DoJ says this is because conversations are not encrypted, videos are grainy, and users cannot edit messages or see typing indicators.</li><br/>
 <li>Non-iPhone users experience "social stigma, exclusion, and blame" for "breaking" chats with where other participants own iPhones. This is "particularly powerful" for teenagers, and "social pressure" causes teens to switch to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
 <li>While the DoJ's comments on messaging largely ignore that Apple plans to bring feature parity with &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, it says that won't be enough because third-party apps still won't be able to be set as the default app for SMS/&zwnj;RCS&zwnj; messages.</li><br/>
 <li>The DoJ speculates that because &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; improves over time, Apple might not support later versions of &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, so cross-platform messages "could soon be broken on iPhones" after Apple adds &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; support later in 2024.</li><br/>
 <li>The DoJ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/apple-confirms-it-shut-down-beeper-mini/">references Beeper Mini</a>, an app that gained access to Apple's iMessage servers by exploiting fake credentials. The DoJ claims that it was a solution that "fixed" the broken cross-platform messaging experience. Apple made &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users less secure because it also supported end-to-end encryption.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="carplay">CarPlay</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> forces an iPhone-centric experience by taking over "all of the screens, sensors, and gauges" in a car in order to use &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; features. The DoJ suggests Apple is leveraging the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user base to exert power over American carmakers and restrict innovation, but Apple has so far not seen a lot of traction with &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; 2 and many car makers, such as Tesla and GM, are opting out of &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="competitors">Competitors</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>The DoJ claims that Apple is the reason that only Google and Samsung remain as meaningful competitors in the premium smartphone market.</li><br/>
 <li>The DoJ blames Apple's market dominance for failed smartphones that include the Amazon Fire Phone and the Microsoft Windows Phone.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="other_doj_claims">Other DoJ Claims</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>The iPod was successful because of the DoJ's antitrust case against Microsoft because it allowed Apple to launch iTunes on Windows PCs. "Microsoft did not charge Apple a 30 percent fee for each song downloaded from the iTunes Store."</li><br/>
 <li>The DoJ holds itself responsible for Apple's success. U.S. vs. Microsoft "created new opportunities for innovation," and without this case, Apple would have had more difficulty achieving success with the iPod and the subsequent &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple made smartphones other than the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; worse by stifling the growth of cloud gaming apps and interactive AI services.</li><br/>
 <li>The DoJ says that Apple copied the idea of a smartwatch from third-party developers.</li><br/>
 <li>The DoJ warns that Apple may "use its power to force its own users (and their data to become its next profitable product."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="dojs_market_definition">DoJ's Market Definition</h2><br/>
The DoJ suggests that Apple violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which says that it is illegal to acquire or maintain monopoly power "through improper means." To make this argument, the DoJ needs to prove that Apple is a monopoly power in a relevant market, and that Apple used anticompetitive conduct to achieve and maintain that monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
Sherman Act claims failed in Epic vs. Apple because &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; was not successful narrowing down the defined market in which Apple had a supposed monopoly. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; argued that the relevant market was apps on Apple devices, but the court decided it was all digital mobile gaming transactions. Apple was not found to have a monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
The DoJ is also using a narrowed market definition that may not hold up. It has created a "performance smartphone market" defined as a "more expensive segment of the broader smartphone market." In this "performance market," Apple's U.S. market share by revenue is over 70 percent. In the "broader smartphone market" in the U.S., Apple has a 65 percent share.<br/>
<br/>
It could be tough for the DoJ to prove that Apple has a monopoly with only a 65 percent share of the market. 70 percent market share is a more solid argument for a monopoly, but the case against Apple won't be as strong as the case against Google. Google, for example, has a 90 percent share of the search engine market.<br/>
<br/>
Apple claims that it operates in a global market, and that the market share that should be considered is the global market share. Apple only has around a 20 percent cut of the global market.<br/>
<br/>
The DoJ also argues that Apple has a larger share "among key demographics" such as higher-income households and among young people.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="what_the_doj_wants">What the DoJ Wants</h2><br/>
The DoJ wants the court to find that Apple has acted unlawfully to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the U.S. smartphone market. It has asked for "relief as needed" to address anticompetitive harm and restore competitive conditions, and a ruling that prevents Apple from continuing to engage in anticompetitive practices.<br/>
<br/>
According to the DoJ, Apple should be prevented from using its control of app distribution to undermine cross-platform technologies, that it should not be able to use private APIs to undermine cross-platform technologies like messaging and smartwatches, and that Apple should be prevented from using the terms and conditions of its contracts with developers, consumers, and accessory makers to maintain a monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apples_response">Apple's Response</h2><br/>
Apple has an official statement on the DoJ's lawsuit:<blockquote>At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love--designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people's privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users. This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple--where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people's technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.</blockquote><br/>
Apple has also held media briefings and shared information on key facts in the lawsuit. Some highlights:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>The DoJ has changed the scope of its case six times due to the results in &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; v. Apple and other lawsuits. Several theories were considered and had to be abandoned because of a lack of evidence.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple says that the lawsuit won't be successful because it does not get the facts right. It would set a dangerous precedent for government interference in technology, and would make the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; less private, less secure, and more vulnerable to malware. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; would not be able to operate as well with other Apple products, and user information would be put at risk.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple claims the DoJ wants to turn the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; into an Android, and that the case goes after the key features that make the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; experience unique.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple does not believe the lawsuit has a basis in antitrust law and seems to be suggesting that Apple has an obligation to design its products in a way that would help competitors.</li><br/>
 <li>In a recent ruling in the AliveCor v. Apple dispute, the court said that it cannot oversee technology and innovation, and it is not for the court to analyze algorithms.</li><br/>
 <li>The DoJ ignored changes to streaming game apps and plans to implement &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, and Apple says that super apps have always been permitted.</li><br/>
 <li>Apple claims the DoJ is trying to fit Apple into the theories that were successful in the antitrust case against Microsoft 20 years back, but Apple does not agree with the parallels. Microsoft had a 95 percent share of the market, and Apple says that business decisions are made to provide consumers with maximum privacy and safety.</li><br/>

Now that the DoJ has filed a lawsuit, Apple will have a 60-day period to respond. Apple plans to move to dismiss the complaint.<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn't happen, the case will move forward. There will be briefings, hearings, and a discovery period. It will be a few months before there are additional filings, and the entire legal process will span for multiple years. Apple says that it plans to vigorously fight the case.<br/>
<br/>
Should the judge assigned to the case rule in the DoJ's favor, there will be appeals and then remedies for the anticompetitive behavior will need to be determined.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-vs-doj/">Apple vs. the U.S. Department of Justice: What You Need to Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vs-the-u-s-department-of-justice-what-you-need-to-know.2422813/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">A18 Pro chip</a> for iPhone 16 Pro models will feature a larger die size for boosted artificial intelligence performance, according to Jeff Pu, an investment analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
In a research note with Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities this week, Pu added that the A18 Pro chip will be equipped with a 6-core GPU, which would be equal to the A17 Pro chip in iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Generative AI</h2><br/>
iOS 18 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">rumored to include new generative AI features</a> for a range of iPhone features and apps, including Siri, Spotlight, Apple Music, Health, Messages, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, Shortcuts, and more. Apple has reportedly considered partnering with companies <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/">such as Google, OpenAI, and Baidu</a> for at least some of these features.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 16 Pro models are rumored to feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">upgraded Neural Engine</a> with "significantly" more cores, which could result in some of iOS 18's generative AI features being exclusive to those models. Pu previously said the larger die size would be related to the Neural Engine, which could power on-device generative AI features.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has used a 16-core Neural Engine since the iPhone 12 series. However, it has still improved the Neural Engine's performance over the years, even when core counts have not changed. For example, Apple says the A17 Pro chip has up to a 2x faster Neural Engine compared to the one in the iPhone 14 Pro's A16 Bionic chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has promised to make generative AI announcements <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">later this year</a>. iOS 18 will be previewed at Apple's developers conference <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC</a> in June, so we're just a few months away from learning about the company's plans.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>6-Core GPU</h2><br/>
With the A17 Pro chip, iPhone 15 Pro models have significantly improved graphics capabilities compared to previous models. Apple said the new 6-core GPU is up to 20% faster and also more power efficient than the 5-core GPU in the A16 Bionic chip. iPhone 15 Pro models also support hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading for improved graphics rendering, which results in more realistic graphics in games.<br/>
<br/>
Pu believes Apple will stick with a 6-core GPU for the A18 Pro chip, so graphics improvements may be more limited for iPhone 16 Pro models this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2><br/>
Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 16 series in September.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/why-upgrade/">added a "Why Upgrade" section</a> to its website, which is aimed at encouraging customers with older iPhones to upgrade to a newer model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-reasons-to-upgrade.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943185" /><br/>
The website allows customers to compare the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, or &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
Each comparison shows what new features someone with an older &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will get when upgrading to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup. With the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11, for example, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; offers 4x better photo resolution, more base storage, Action and Cinematic mode for video, USB-C, a 60 percent faster GPU, 5G, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The site highlights differences in display technology, design, sizing, connectivity, and more. Apple also provides details on the trade-in value of each older &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; so customers know what kind of discount they can get when trading a device in with the purchase of a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
To further soften the costs of upgrading, Apple advertises <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> Monthly Installments and carrier deals that can drop the price of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; to &#36;0. Apple also details the ease of upgrading to a new device with features like Quick Start and eSIM.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the smartphone market in the United States is saturated, and there are few new customers for Apple. Upgraders are an important market segment, and Apple is continually seeking ways to get customers to regularly purchase new iPhones to maintain sales momentum.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-why-upgrade-site/">Apple Outlines &#039;Reasons to Upgrade&#039; Your iPhone on New Website</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-outlines-reasons-to-upgrade-your-iphone-on-new-website.2422789/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.4.1, a minor update for the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; operating system that launched last September. &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4.1 comes three weeks after &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900001" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/sonoma-desktop-wwdc.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
The â€Œâ€Œâ€Œâ€Œ&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;â€Œâ€Œ 14.4â€Œ.1 update can be downloaded for free on all eligible Macs using the Software Update section of System Settings. There's also a macOS 13.6.6 release for those who are still running macOS Ventura.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4.1 update fixes an issue that could cause USB hubs connected to external displays not to be recognized. It also addresses an issue that could cause apps with Java to quit unexpectedly, and it fixes an issue that could cause Audio Unit plug-ins for professional music apps not to open.<br/>
<br/>
All three of these bugs are notable issues that Mac users <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/do-not-update-macos-sonoma-14-4/">have been complaining about</a> since the launch of macOS 14.4. Oracle <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/16/oracle-warns-about-macos-14-4-java-issues/">warned users about the Java issue</a> last week, letting customers know that Apple silicon Mac users relying on Java should hold off on updating to macOS 14.4 if possible, and there were a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/macos-sonoma-14-4-usb-hub-issues-reported/">number of reports about problems</a> with hubs and monitors from customers who had installed 14.4. <blockquote>This update provides bug fixes for your Mac, including:<br/>
- USB hubs connected to external displays may not be recognized<br/>
- Copy protected Audio Unit plug-ins designed for professional music apps may not open or pass validation<br/>
- Apps that include Java may quit unexpectedly<br/>

Specifically, you can find all-time low prices on the iPad Air and M2 MacBook Air during this event.<br/>

Sony's PlayStation 5 Slim console launched last November and Best Buy and other retailers have been hosting solid deals on the hardware for a few weeks now. At Best Buy, you can get the PS5 Slim (Disc Edition) Spider-Man 2 Bundle for <a href="https://howl.me/clUh1erQcL6"><strong>&#36;449.99</strong></a>, down from its launch price of &#36;499.99.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While the Apple Pencil is currently compatible with iPads only, a future version of the accessory may work with Apple's Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Vision-Pro-and-Apple-Pencil-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943128" /><br/>
Apple has internally tested a new Apple Pencil with visionOS support, according to a source familiar with the matter. This would allow the Apple Pencil to be used with drawing apps on the Vision Pro, such as Freeform and Pixelmator.<br/>
<br/>
No specific details are known about this project, but one possibility is that users would be able to draw with the Apple Pencil on a desk or another flat surface, and the drawing would appear in the open visionOS app. This would essentially turn a person's surroundings into a giant canvas, complete with pressure and tilt sensitivity.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/">new Apple Pencil is rumored</a> to launch alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-likely-to-begin-shipping-in-april/">new iPad Pro and iPad Air models in April</a>, but we have not confirmed if it will support visionOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Pencil compatibility with the Vision Pro would also require updated software, but it is unclear which version might add support. The first beta of visionOS 1.2 will likely be made available to developers as early as this week, and Apple is expected to announce visionOS 2 at its annual developers conference WWDC in June.<br/>
<br/>
As with any product that Apple develops, there is no guarantee that the company will move forward with releasing an Apple Pencil with visionOS support.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-pencil-visionon-support-in-testing/">New Apple Pencil With Vision Pro Support in Testing Ahead of visionOS 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-pencil-with-vision-pro-support-in-testing-ahead-of-visionos-2.2422753/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> will feature a landscape-oriented front-facing camera for the first time, according to the Apple leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPad-Pro-2024-Landscape-Camera-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-940262" /><br/>
Instant Digital reiterated the design change earlier today on Weibo with a simple accompanying 2D image. The post reveals that the entire TrueDepth camera array will move to the right side of the device, while the microphone will remain on the top and simply be centered.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the front-facing camera of both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; resides on the top of the device, which means that the camera is positioned to the left when the device is being used in landscape, such as with a Magic Keyboard. Apple relocated the front-facing camera of the 10th-generation â€Œ<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>â€Œ to the side of the device to provide a better experience in landscape and the company has not launched a new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; since then. <br/>
<br/>
In January, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">code discovered in iOS 17.4</a> suggested the next &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s TrueDepth camera array would be moved to the side of the device. "During â€Œ<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>â€Œ setup, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; needs to be in landscape with the camera at the top of the screen," the code read. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Instant Digital suggested that the switch to a landscape front-facing camera could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">also be made on the next-generation iPad Air</a>. How Apple will achieve this switch to a landscape camera on the new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models is unclear, since the second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> connects to both the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; using an inductive magnetic charger located where it seems the camera will need to move to. Both the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are expected to launch within weeks.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/new-ipad-pro-to-feature-landscape-camera/">New iPad Pro Again Rumored to Feature Landscape Front-Facing Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pro-again-rumored-to-feature-landscape-front-facing-camera.2422746/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's compliance with new EU laws designed to rein in the market power of big tech companies is set to be investigated by regulators, the European Commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1689">announced</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933094" /><br/>
The Commission said on Monday that non-compliance investigations have been opened against Apple, Google, and Meta, under the new <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/document/print/en/ip_24_1689/IP_24_1689_EN.pdf">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The probe into Apple will look at whether the company allows developers to "steer" users away from its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, as well as its default web browser choice screen. Google's rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing in Google searches are also being looked at, as is Meta's "pay or consent model."<br/>
<blockquote>The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether the measures implemented by Alphabet and Apple in relation to their obligations pertaining to app stores are in breach of the DMA. Article 5(4) of the DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to "steer" consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers' app stores, free of charge.<br/>
<br/>
The Commission is concerned that Alphabet's and Apple's measures may not be fully compliant as they impose various restrictions and limitations. These constrain, among other things, developers' ability to freely communicate and promote offers and directly conclude contracts, including by imposing various charges.<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
The Commission has opened proceedings against Apple regarding their measures to comply with obligations to (i) enable end users to easily uninstall any software applications on iOS, (ii) easily change default settings on iOS and (iii) prompt users with choice screens which must effectively and easily allow them to select an alternative default service, such as a browser or search engine on their iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
The Commission is concerned that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, in contravention of Article 6(3) of the DMA.</blockquote>The Commission said it is also taking other investigatory steps to gather facts and information to clarify whether Apple's new fee structure and other terms and conditions for alternative app stores and distribution of apps from the web (sideloading) may be defeating the purpose of its obligations under the DMA.<br/>
<br/>
The Commission has also adopted five retention orders addressed to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, asking them to retain documents which might be used to assess their compliance with the DMA obligations. The Commission intends to conclude the proceedings opened today within 12 months. <br/>
<br/>
In cases of infringement, the Commission can impose fines up to 10% of the company's total worldwide turnover. Such fines can go up to 20% in case of repeated infringement under the DMA. The Commission also has the power to adopt "additional remedies" such as "obliging a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it," or banning the company from acquisitions of additional services related to the non-compliance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple earlier this month implemented several major changes to the way the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and apps operate in the EU in order to comply with the DMA. These changes are included in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/">iOS 17.4</a>, but are generally limited to countries that are in the European Union.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/eu-to-investigate-apple-dma-compliance/">EU Opens Non-Compliance Investigations into Apple, Meta, and Google</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-opens-non-compliance-investigations-into-apple-meta-and-google.2422739/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is set to roll out a new system that allows retail store staff to wirelessly update the software on iPhones prior to sale, without having to take them out of their packaging.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Store-Vancouver-Canada.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901784" /><br/>
Writing in the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-24/how-strong-is-the-justice-department-case-against-apple-it-could-be-stronger-lu5ii64n">Power On newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the new proprietary system, called "Presto," relies on MagSafe and other wireless technologies, and "looks a bit like a metal cubby for shoes." It will begin rolling out widely across the U.S. in April, with Apple's intention to have the technology in all U.S. retail stores by early summer, he added.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman first reported on the wireless system in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/retail-stores-to-update-iphones-with-new-system/">October</a>, describing it as a "proprietary pad-like device" on which retail store staff can place a sealed â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ box. The system wirelessly turns on the iPhone inside, updates its software to the latest version available, and then powers it off. <br/>
<br/>
Apple developed "Presto" as a way to avoid selling iPhones in retail stores with outdated software. For example, the iPhone 15 series shipped with iOS 17, but Apple subsequently released iOS 17.0.1 before the devices launched. The point update was required to fix an issue that prevented the transfer of data directly from another iPhone during the initial setup process.<br/>
<br/>
That meant new iPhone 15 owners had to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/warning-update-your-iphone-15-to-ios-17-0-2/">update the devices themselves</a> as part of the setup process, or manually via the Settings app under General â†’ Software Update if they opted to set up the device as new and transfer data later. Following the rollout of "Presto," such a scenario will be avoidable, making the setup process more straightforward for end users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-iphone-in-box-update-system-rollout/">Apple Readying In-Box iPhone Software Update System for Retail Stores</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-readying-in-box-iphone-software-update-system-for-retail-stores.2422738/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 will give iPhone users greater control over Home Screen app icon arrangement, according to sources familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-Home-Screen-Gradient-Blank-Spaces-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943087" /><br/>
While app icons will likely remain locked to an invisible grid system on the Home Screen, to ensure there is some uniformity, our sources say that users will be able to arrange icons more freely on iOS 18. For example, we expect that the update will introduce the ability to create blank spaces, rows, and columns between app icons.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman was first to report that the iPhone would get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-more-customizable-home-screen-rumor/">"more customizable" Home Screen</a> starting with iOS 18. It is already possible to customize the Home Screen and create blank app icons with apps such as Shortcuts and Widgetsmith, but Apple's own personalization options will be more convenient and official.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone users have already been able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/customize-lock-screen-ios/">customize the Lock Screen</a> since iOS 16, and we expect the Home Screen to receive similar treatment with iOS 18. The update will introduce additional customization options for the Home Screen, according to our sources, and this could result in the biggest Home Screen revamp in several years.<br/>
