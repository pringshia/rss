Apple has reportedly been considering producing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Pro models in India for the last couple of years, and has now decided to manufacture the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max models in India. <br/>
<br/>
Initially, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will be imported into the country, but Apple will start local assembly for both the domestic market and exports shortly after launch in mid-September, once the new product introduction (NPI) process is complete.<br/>
<br/>
Training is said to be already underway for thousands of workers at Foxconn's factory in southern Tamil Nadu state as it rushes to produce the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models as close to the global launch as possible.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released an updated version of iOS 17.6.1, with the new software coming a week and a half after the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/07/apple-releases-ios-17-6-1/">original iOS 17.6.1 update</a>. The new version has a build number of 21G101, up from 21G93.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960873" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-17.6.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
iOS 17.6.1 can be downloaded on eligible iPhones and iPads over-the-air by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, the iOS 17.6.1 update addresses an issue that could prevent the enabling or disabling of Advanced Data Protection. It is not clear what is different between the new version of the software and the original version.<br/>
<blockquote>This update includes important bug fixes and addresses an issue that prevents enabling or disabling Advanced Data Protection.</blockquote><br/>
The Advanced Data Protection bug impacted a small number of users. Those who tried to turn Advanced Data Protection on and weren't able to get it enabled saw an error message and it was clear it wasn't active. Affected users who tried to turn it off saw it disabled in the interface, though it was actually still active for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> data.<br/>
<br/>
Both of those bugs have been fixed in the update. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who had the bug that prevented Advanced Data Protection from properly turning off will see a notification that asks them to confirm the decision to turn the feature off after installing iOS 17.6.1. Apple says that the few users who experienced this bug had an expected level of security or more, in the situation where ADP did not turn off as expected.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/apple-re-releases-ios-17-6-1/">Apple Re-Releases iOS 17.6.1 With Advanced Data Protection Bug Fix</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-re-releases-ios-17-6-1-with-advanced-data-protection-bug-fix.2433936/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced the launch of a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com">Podcasts on the web feature</a>, which works in Safari, Chrome, Edge, and Firefox on Macs, PCs, and other devices. Podcasts on the web allows users to search for, browse through, and listen to podcasts with access to the Up Next queue and library when signed in to an Apple Account.<br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> on the web works like the &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; app, and users can subscribe to and get updates for their favorite shows. Apple has long had a podcasts feature that allowed podcasts to be listened to on the web when embedded in an article, but now there is a dedicated website on devices without a Podcasts app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/podcasts-on-the-web.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961962" /><br/>
You can check out Podcasts on the web by going to Apple's <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com">podcasts.apple.com site</a>. Note that if you have the Podcasts app installed on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac, the website will open the app automatically rather than directing you to the web.<br/>
<br/>
Podcasts on the web comes a month after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-maps-now-available-on-the-web/">introduced Apple Maps on the web</a>, which serves as an alternative to Google Maps.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/apple-podcasts-now-available-on-the-web/">Apple Podcasts Now Available on the Web</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-podcasts-now-available-on-the-web.2433933/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 18, currently in beta, Apple is allowing iPhone users to replace the flashlight and camera buttons on the Lock Screen with something more useful, or to make them disappear entirely.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-lock-screen-buttons.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954622" /><br/>
The dedicated flashlight and camera shortcuts you see at the bottom of your iPhone's Lock Screen were introduced in their current form with the release of iOS 11 alongside the iPhone X in 2018, and the two icons have since been a staple, non-customizable feature.<br/>
<br/>
But that's all set to change this September with the launch of iOS 18. The Lock Screen buttons on your iPhone can now be replaced with any Control Center option. This includes system features like Dark Mode, Airplane Mode, Accessibility options, Calculator, and Translate, as well as Shortcuts – making the functional possibilities endless. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-the-ios-18-public-beta/">How to Install the Third iOS 18 Public Beta</a></li></ul><br/>
The change in iOS 18 is part of a broader Control Center redesign, significantly expanding the quick access potential from the Lock Screen. Apple has also opened up this functionality to third-party apps, allowing their icons to be added to the Control Center and, by extension, the Lock Screen buttons. <br/>
<br/>
To maintain user privacy and data security, certain options may require Face ID or Touch ID authentication before granting access from the Lock Screen. This ensures that sensitive information remains protected even with this increased accessibility.<br/>
<br/>
The following steps explain how to switch up your Lock Screen buttons in iOS 18:<br/>
<ol><br/>
    <li>Press and hold on the Lock Screen after authenticating.</li><br/>
    <li>Tap <strong>Customize</strong>.</li><br/>
    <li>Tap <strong>Lock Screen</strong>.</li><br/>
    <li>From there, tap the "<strong>-</strong>" icon to remove apps that are assigned to those buttons. The Flashlight and Camera apps are the default, so they will need to be removed.<br/>

    <li>Next, tap the "<strong>+</strong>" button and choose a new control to add from the scrolling menu of options.</li><br/>
<li>Repeat for the second Lock Screen button if desired.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> illustration app Procreate today <a href="https://procreate.com/ai">announced</a> that it has no plans to bring generative AI to its software, setting itself apart from many competitors who have embraced the technology.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-pencil.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939786" /><br/>
The decision comes at a time when many companies in the digital art space, such as Adobe, are rapidly integrating AI capabilities into their products and services. Procreate's stance is grounded in a commitment to preserving what it describes as the "humanity" of creative work. The company issued a statement on its website that expressed strong reservations about the impact of generative AI on the creative process:<blockquote>Generative AI is ripping the humanity out of things. Built on a foundation of theft, the technology is steering us toward a barren future. We think machine learning is a compelling technology with a lot of merit, but the path generative AI is on is wrong for us.<br/>
<br/>
We're here for the humans. We're not chasing a technology that is a moral threat to our greatest jewel: human creativity. In this technological rush, this might make us an exception or seem at risk of being left behind. But we see this road less travelled as the more exciting and fruitful one for our community.</blockquote>James Cuda, the CEO of Procreate, reinforced the position in a <a href="https://x.com/Procreate/status/1825311104584802470">video posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter), expressing his dislike of generative AI and explaining that Procreate's products are designed with the intention that "a human will be creating something." The announcement appears to have resonated with many digital artists who have expressed concerns about the integration of AI into creative tools.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/procreate/">Procreate</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/procreate-condemns-ai/">iPad Illustration App Procreate Condemns Generative AI</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-illustration-app-procreate-condemns-generative-ai.2433922/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple has supported the National Park Foundation with this annual charitable initiative since 2017. This year, the program runs from today through August 25.<br/>
<br/>
Apple celebrates U.S. national parks every August with special content across <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a>, and other apps.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's rumored tabletop robot has been spotted in its global supply chain for the first time, Taiwan's <a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7240/8170073"><em>United Daily News</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Apple-Robot-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961758" /><br/>
Apple has apparently chosen Hongzhun to play a critical role in the development of the forthcoming device. Specifically, the supplier will be responsible for developing key mechanical components and casings for the tabletop robot. Once the product moves into mass production, Hongzhun will be tasked with producing the mechanical parts on a large scale. Hongzhun is a subsidiary of Foxconn, a longstanding manufacturing partner of Apple. <br/>
<br/>
At its most recent shareholders' meeting, Hongzhun announced its intention to invest in emerging technologies such as robotics and AI, signaling a move away from its traditional focus on producing casings for laptops and game consoles. Hongzhun has prior experience in assembling Foxconn's own "FoxBot" robot.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's robot project, reportedly code-named J595 internally, is described <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a> as a desktop device that combines an iPad-like display with a robotic arm. It is designed to serve as a central hub in Apple's smart home ecosystem, integrating with other Apple products and services like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, and run a variant of iPadOS. It could be introduced as soon as 2026, with an estimated price tag of approximately &#36;1,000.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/">Foxconn</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-robot/">Apple Robot</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/apple-robot-spotted-in-supply-chain/">First Plans for Apple&#039;s Tabletop Robot Spotted in Supply Chain</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-plans-for-apples-tabletop-robot-spotted-in-supply-chain.2433913/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple still plans to refresh its entry-level and mid-tier AirPods later this year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/AirPods-Fourth-Generation-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905652" /><br/>
Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-18/why-is-apple-building-own-modem-company-plays-long-game-in-dropping-qualcomm-lzzk8616">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman reiterated his previous reporting by saying that Apple intends to release two versions at different price points, replacing the current second-generation and third-generation models.<br/>
<br/>
Both models will feature a redesigned look, including a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port, shorter stems similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, along with an updated fit and enhanced audio quality.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end version is expected to include Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), making ANC available at a lower price point for the first time and no longer exclusive to &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said Apple intends to launch a third-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; "later," by which he likely means next year, based on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/17/airpods-4-production-and-launch-timing/">previous reporting</a>.<br/>

What Gurman did not mention in his latest update is the status of new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[The new bronze-like color rumored to be replacing Blue Titanium in Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro lineup may be called "Desert Titanium," according to the leaker known as "Majin Bu."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iphone-16-pro-bronze.jpg" alt="bronze" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961906" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Concept render of new iPhone 16 Pro color</em></div><br/>
Bu referenced the name on Sunday in a <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1825156368195584032">post</a> on X (Twitter) in which they shared an image of camera lens rings purportedly destined for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models.<br/>
<br/>
"The desert titanium color is kind of dark gold, similar to the old purple color, relatively discreet and deep," said Bu. This isn't the first time the leaker has used the name "Desert Titanium" in reference to the new color, which has variously been described as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/16/iphone-16-pro-colors-revealed/">rose or rose-gold</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/new-iphone-16-pro-color-bronze-appearance/">bronze-like</a>. Back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-16-pro-two-new-color-options/">February</a>, Bu said that the "Desert Titanium" will be similar to the Gold color option offered on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, but "deeper and heavier." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/camera-lens-rings-iphone16-pro.jpeg" alt="lens rings" width="1289" height="728" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961904" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Alleged camera lens rings for iPhone 16 Pro models</em></div><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro will introduce "Desert Titanium" as a new color option, replacing the iPhone 15 Pro's "Blue Titanium". It will be available alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/16/iphone-16-pro-colors-revealed/">White, Black, and Natural Titanium</a>. This year's Black Titanium is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/iphone-16-pro-colors-shown-leaked-image/">darker</a>, while Natural Titanium will have a more pronounced gray finish.<br/>
<br/>
One <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/">rumor</a> suggests that Apple is using an improved process for finishing and coloring titanium, which will result in a glossier look than the brushed aluminum finish of the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models. The glossy finish could look much more like the stainless steel that Apple used in prior years, but it will be more resistant to scratches.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Almost all of Apple's built-in apps are getting new features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and that includes the Maps app. The Maps app isn't getting any fun new AI additions, but Apple does have some useful changes in store.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Generic-iOS-18-Maps-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961870" /><br/>
<h2 id="hiking_trails">Hiking Trails</h2><br/>
Apple added topographic maps to the Apple Watch last year, and now detailed topographic maps are also coming to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The Maps app features detailed trail networks and hikes, including all 63 U.S. national parks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-hikes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961875" /><br/>
You can do a search for "hikes" or "hiking routes" in the Maps app to see nearby trail options, with Apple including hike length, elevation, ratings, and other details.<br/>
<br/>
Hikes can be filtered by length, route type (loop, point to point, or out and back), and elevation, and can be saved for offline access.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-hike-filters.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961876" /><br/>
You can zoom into hiking areas to see specific trails, or search for trails. If you tap on a trail, Apple has information that includes length, highest point, lowest point, and distance. You can also see a full overview of the trail's path and get lengths for each section.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-find-trails.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961877" /><br/>
Trails and hikes are separate entities in the Maps app. A search for hikes essentially brings you to the general area where specific trails are located, and you can zoom in with the Maps app to find the trail you want to take.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="custom_routes">Custom Routes</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> supports custom routes in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, so you can plan out a specific hiking route that you want to take. At a trailhead, you can tap on the "Create a Custom Route" option to initiate the custom routing experience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-custom-route.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961878" /><br/>
From there, you tap on the map to begin setting points for your route, and the Maps app will provide length and elevation details. You can also have the Maps app finish a route automatically by tapping on the Reverse, Out and Back, or Close Loop options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-custom-route-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961879" /><br/>
For hikes and trails, the Maps app will not let you create an unsafe route that does not stick to existing trails, so it's difficult to make a dangerous map out into the middle of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
Route creation is not limited to hikes and trails. You can add a pinned spot to a map, tap on the "More" option and choose Create Custom Route.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="search_here">Search Here</h2><br/>
Apple made it easier to search in locations you might be thinking of visiting or those you want to explore by adding a "Search here" button. If you look up a place, such as San Diego, and then tap on search, it'll search in the area that's on your screen rather at your physical location.<br/>
<br/>
If you search for something and then pan around the map, the search will update reliably in the new location. When you zoom in, you'll see a dedicated "Search here" button that gives you more control over where you want to search.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="saving_favorites">Saving Favorites</h2><br/>
If you find a favorite hike, trail, or custom route, you can save it to your Library to save it for later. To do so, find the relevant hike and then tap on the "Add to Library" button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-trail-save-library.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961880" /><br/>
You can rename hikes and add specific information that you might want to revisit later, as well as download the route for offline usage.<br/>
<br/>
Tapping on the "+" button when viewing any location on the map, including a hike, will also add that location to the library.<br/>
<br/>
Favorites are stored in the Maps app and can be accessed by tapping on your profile picture and choosing the Library section.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="library">Library</h2><br/>
All saved content from the Maps app including locations, routes, guides, and pins are stored in the new Library section of the Maps app rather than in separate sections as in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-library.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961881" /><br/>
The Library also shows all of your Recently Added content.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><br/>
You can tap on any place in the Maps app and select the Add a Note option from the menu. From there, you can make a note about what you want to remember about a location.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-maps-add-a-note.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961882" /><br/>
Notes are private and are kept on-device. They are only visible to the note creator.<br/>
<br/>

		<title>Apple is Opening Up the iPhone&#039;s NFC Chip: What You Need to Know</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of iOS 18.1 this fall, Apple will allow third-party developers to support NFC contactless transactions for payments and more. Right now, the NFC chip is locked down, and it's primarily only used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, but a number of new capabilities will be coming when Apple expands access to NFC.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Tap-to-Pay-on-iPhone-avail-FR-transaction.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922462" /><br/>
<h2 id="nfc_capabilities_in_third-party_apps">NFC Capabilities in Third-Party Apps</h2><br/>
With NFC access, banks will be able to offer direct contactless payment options that serve as an alternative to &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, but it app developers will be able to do more, too. Some ways Apple says NFC can be used:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Contactless payments in stores</li><br/>
 <li>Car keys</li><br/>
 <li>Closed-loop transit cards</li><br/>
 <li>Corporate badges</li><br/>
 <li>Student IDs</li><br/>
 <li>Government IDs (coming in the future)</li><br/>
 <li>Home keys</li><br/>
 <li>Hotel keys</li><br/>
 <li>Merchant loyalty and reward cards</li><br/>
 <li>Event tickets</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2 id="security_protections">Security Protections</h2><br/>
Apple is creating several new APIs that will power the contactless transactions. The APIs will use the Secure Enclave in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, with sensitive information stored directly on device.<br/>
<br/>
Developers will have to request access to the NFC and Secure Enclave entitlement, sign a commercial agreement with Apple, and pay associated fees. Apple plans to make sure that only authorized developers who meet regulatory and industry requirements and commit to Apple's security and privacy standards can get access to the APIs.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="default_contactless_app_options">Default Contactless App Options</h2><br/>
Once these features go live, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users can open up the app and then hold the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; near an NFC terminal to make a payment. So if you want to pay at a store using your bank's NFC payment service, you'd open your bank app and then double-click the side button on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to initiate a transaction.<br/>
<br/>
Third-party apps will also be able to be set as default contactless apps in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
Transactions will be verified with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_pay_and_apple_wallet">Apple Pay and Apple Wallet</h2><br/>
The NFC APIs are separate from &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; and Apple Wallet, which is why you will need to open up a third-party app to use its NFC capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="available_countries">Available Countries</h2><br/>
Apple's NFC and Secure Enclave APIs are coming to developers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the UK, and the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Support will come to additional locations in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-opens-iphone-nfc-access-eu/">already opened up</a> the NFC chip in the European Economic Area.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ios_18.1_launch_date">iOS 18.1 Launch Date</h2><br/>
The new APIs will launch in iOS 18.1, which is an update that Apple is testing at the current time. iOS 18.1 will likely be released a few weeks after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and we are expecting to see it sometime in October.<br/>
<br/>
In past years, .1 updates have come out between October 20 and October 25, so the week of October 21 is likely when we will see iOS 18.1 come out.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/">NFC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-nfc-chip-ios-18-1/">Apple is Opening Up the iPhone&#039;s NFC Chip: What You Need to Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-is-opening-up-the-iphones-nfc-chip-what-you-need-to-know.2433801/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LC4CBHVRoNg" title="tvOS 18: Best NEW Features Coming to Apple TV" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li><strong>InSight</strong> - InSight is like Amazon X-ray, providing information about actors, character, and music from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> movies and shows in real-time. If you pause a show that's playing, you can see details on the actors, the song that's playing, and more. If you're using an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as a remote for an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, you can get InSight information right on your phone. Note that this feature only works with &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; content right now.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Enhance Dialogue and Subtitles</strong> - Enhance Dialogue is setting that already exists, but Apple is making it better with machine learning and computational audio improvements. It'll be better at improving vocal clarity over loud music, action scenes, and background noise. Plus Apple updated it so it works with HDMI-connected speakers, when playing content on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, when using AirPods, and with other Bluetooth audio devices. As a bonus, Apple is also improving subtitles, so they'll appear intelligently such as when content is muted or when a TV show or movie is rewound.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>FaceTime Updates</strong> - When you use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> with your &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as the camera, you can now see real-time Live Captions during the call. This works in English in the United States and Canada. Semi-related, there is a new option to use SharePlay so everyone can contribute songs to a party playlist by scanning a QR code.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>New Screen Savers</strong> - Apple is adding new screen saver options, including Portraits (shows your Portrait images), TV and Movies, and Snoopy.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Projector Support</strong> - If you have a projector, you'll be pleased to hear that tvOS 18 adds support for the 21:9 aspect ratio used by most projectors.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Some Android smartphones have been found to contain a hidden security vulnerability that could allow remote access to user data, alarming cybersecurity experts and leading to a halt in the use of these devices by a major intelligence contractor, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/15/google-sold-android-phones-with-hidden-insecure-feature-companies-find/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-837104" /><br/>
The vulnerability, identified by the security firm iVerify, involves a pre-installed application known as Showcase.apk, which, though dormant by default, can be activated to potentially allow unauthorized remote access to the devices. The Showcase.apk application was discovered within certain models of Android phones, including Google Pixel devices.<br/>
<br/>
According to iVerify, the application appears to have been designed for use in retail environments, allowing employees to demonstrate the device's features to customers. However, researchers found that when activated, the application could connect to a server via an unsecured "http" connection, making it vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals. This flaw could enable attackers to execute code remotely, potentially injecting malicious code or spyware and gaining access to sensitive data stored on the device.<br/>
<br/>
Palantir Technologies, a data analysis platform vendor that often works with government agencies and other security-sensitive clients, expressed grave concerns about the implications of this vulnerability. The company has ceased the use of Android phones for their employees as a result.<br/>
<br/>
The presence of this vulnerability on Pixel devices is particularly notable since they are known for receiving timely security updates directly from Google. Google has now announced that it will issue an update to remove the Showcase.apk application from all supported Pixel devices. Distributors of other Android phones will also be officially notified of the issue.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cybersecurity/">Cybersecurity</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/16/android-phones-exposed-to-remote-vulnerability/">Android Phones Exposed to Remote Access Vulnerability</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/android-phones-exposed-to-remote-access-vulnerability.2433786/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to upgrade its entire AirPods lineup this year in one form or another, with a combination of new model launches and upcoming software updates for existing devices. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airpods-school.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905460" /><br/>
Whether you're holding out for the next generation of AirPods or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, or just want to know what new features are on the way for your current earbuds, keep reading for the full lowdown on what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods</h2><br/>
Fourth-generation AirPods are expected to arrive in late 2024, with Apple planning to release two versions at different price points. Both models will feature a redesigned look, including a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port, shorter stems similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, along with an updated fit and enhanced audio quality.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end version is expected to include Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), making ANC available at a lower price point for the first time. They are also likely to have a speaker in the charging case that can play a sound for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> location tracking. This model will be more affordable than the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; (&#36;249) but will not include features like silicone ear tips. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/AirPods-Fourth-Generation-Feature-Red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905655" /><br/>
One of the key aspects the next-generation AirPods are likely to bring over from the second-generation ‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌ is the H2 chip. Both the second- and third-generation AirPods currently feature the H1 chip. The H2 chip is accompanied by Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, which offers faster and more reliable connectivity with Bluetooth accessories, as well as improved power efficiency, which can contribute to longer battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the H2 chip provides an "exceptional acoustic experience" when paired with a new low-distortion audio driver and custom amplifier in the ‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌. The ‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌ offer richer bass and clearer sound across a wider range of frequencies partly due to the computational audio improvements facilitated by the H2 chip, so similar enhancements seem highly likely to come to the fourth-generation AirPods. <br/>
<br/>
The launch of the two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a> models is expected in September or October 2024, which will also see the current AirPods 2 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a> discontinued.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods Pro</h2><br/>
Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> update introduces several enhancements for the current second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, leveraging machine learning and AI. New head gestures will allow users to control &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; hands-free—nodding to answer a call or shaking their head to decline. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Interactions will also enable hands-free management of calls, messages, and notifications without speaking.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; adds Voice Isolation to &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, improving call clarity by filtering out background noise and focusing on your voice, similar to an existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> feature. Additionally, the Adaptive Audio feature, which adjusts sound and noise cancellation based on your environment, will now offer a customizable setting for finer control.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862208" /><br/>
According to Apple, the ‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌ provide the best wireless audio latency ever for mobile gaming, thanks to improvements coming in ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;‌. Improved latency means that you'll see little to no delay when taking an action in the game and hearing the resulting sound, making for a more responsive experience.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will introduce a "hearing aid mode" to &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. Although they already have a Conversation Boost feature, this update further positions them as a potential hearing aid device.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected introduce a redesigned third-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; in 2025, with refined design and better audio quality, along with a faster processor.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods Max</h2><br/>
&zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are the oldest current-generation AirPods product still in Apple's lineup. It's been over three years since Apple launched &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; in December 2020, and only recently have we begun hearing rumors about Apple's plans for a new-generation model that is coming later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will replace the Lightning port found on the current-generation &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; for a USB-C port. This will ensure the headphones comply with European regulations, and will bring consistency across the company's AirPods lineup. This of course means &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; 2 will come supplied with a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, rather than a Lightning to USB-C cable. Apple will also need to offer a USB-C to 3.5mm audio accessory cable so that users can plug &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; 2 into 3.5mm audio ports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/AirPods-Max-Gen-2-Feature-Dark-Red-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-877636" /><br/>
The Bluetooth 5.3 specification can already be found in the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, and the latest Apple Watch models. It is also supported by all Mac models released in 2023. Therefore it's almost inevitable that the second-generation ‌&zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;‌ will similarly feature the latest Bluetooth standard.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to offer second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; in fresh colors, although what those colors might be remains unknown. &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are currently available in Space Gray, Silver, Green, Sky Blue, and Pink, although interchangeable ear cushions allow for many color combinations.<br/>
<br/>
While there are no rumors that claim &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; 2 will feature the H2 chip, it would seem reasonable to expect them to do so. Apple's custom silicon chip is designed specifically for earbuds and headphones, and enables improved computational audio to enhance sound quality on the current-generation ‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌ and improves battery life with better energy efficiency. Without the H2 chip, &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; would also miss out on Adaptive Audio features including Personalized Volume and Conversation Awareness.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Coming to All AirPods Models</h2><br/>
Personalized Spatial Audio is a feature that already exists for movies, TV shows, and music. It uses the TrueDepth camera on your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ to scan your face and ears, developing a personal profile that customizes Spatial Audio just for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Spatial-Audio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1698" height="978" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787199" /><br/>
With ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;‌, Apple is expanding Personalized Spatial Audio to gaming, with the aim of delivering more immersive sound for gameplay. Personalized Spatial Audio for Gaming will support &zwnj;AirPods 3&zwnj; and 4, &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, and &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/16/apple-airpods-lineup-updates-this-year/">Apple&#039;s AirPods Lineup to Get These Updates in 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-airpods-lineup-to-get-these-updates-in-2024.2433764/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
