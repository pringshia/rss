		<description><![CDATA[Apple Vision Pro launches in the U.S. this Friday, and you will be able to try out the headset at your local Apple Store on the same day.<br/>
<br/>

Starting tomorrow at 8 a.m. local time, all Apple Stores in the U.S. will allow customers to sign up for a Vision Pro demo appointment, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/apple-store-vision-pro-demos-details/">expected to last around 20 to 25 minutes</a>. Apple said its first round of appointments will take place from tomorrow through Sunday, with slots to be filled on a first‑come, first‑served basis.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to provide any further information about how to sign up for a demo, but those details will presumably be shared soon.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the Vision Pro starts at &#36;3,499, these free demos will be especially important for customers who want to experience spatial computing without spending a fortune. During the demo, they will learn how to navigate the visionOS operating system, and explore built-in apps such as Apple TV, Photos, and Safari.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/vision-pro-apple-store-demos/">Vision Pro Demo Appointments Begin Tomorrow at All U.S. Apple Stores</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-demo-appointments-begin-tomorrow-at-all-u-s-apple-stores.2418088/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Meta&#039;s VR Headset Can Play iPhone Spatial Videos</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The Meta Quest VR headset will soon be able to play spatial videos captured on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/v62-software-update-spatial-video-playback-gamepad-support-browswer/">Meta announced today</a>. The upcoming v62 update will add support for the feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/meta-quest-spatial-video.png" alt="" width="780" height="439" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933969" /><br/>
Spatial videos can be uploaded to the Meta Quest headset using the Meta Quest mobile app, so that the stereoscopic videos captured on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models can be relived on Meta's device for those who do not have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Spatial videos uploaded to the Meta Quest will be converted to the correct format for playback on the device, and it will be stored in the cloud. Spatial video content can be selected from the Files menu for an immersive viewing experience. Several demo videos are available on the Meta Quest so users can experience what spatial videos are like.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added the ability to capture spatial videos specifically for &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; headset owners. On Apple devices, spatial videos can only be viewed on the Vision Pro headset, which is priced at &#36;3,500. Other products show the spatial videos as standard 2D videos.<br/>
<blockquote>We are thrilled to announce support for spatial video playback on Meta Quest! If you have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can now upload spatial videos (a.k.a stereoscopic videos) to your Meta Quest headset using the Meta Quest mobile app--letting you relive the moment with surprising depth. With this new feature, you can experience your memories and media content like never before.</blockquote><br/>
At &#36;500, the Meta Quest is more affordable than the Vision Pro, so the option to watch spatial videos on a lower-cost device might be appealing to some &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; owners.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/meta-quest-spatial-videos/">Meta&#039;s VR Headset Can Play iPhone Spatial Videos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/metas-vr-headset-can-play-iphone-spatial-videos.2418087/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For a few months in 2022, Snapchat parent company Snap sold <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/28/snap-pixy-drone/">a Pixy selfie camera drone</a>. Sales of the device were lackluster and Snap stopped all plans for further work on the device after a four month period. Still, Snap sold 71,000 of the devices, but now it's <a href="https://support.pixy.com/hc/en-us">recalling all of them</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/pixy-drone-snapchat.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-844080" /><br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24058119/snap-recall-pixy-drone-refund">The Verge</a></em>, the batteries in the Pixy are a fire hazard and Snap has <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/Snap-Recalls-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Sold-for-Pixy-Flying-Cameras-Due-to-Fire-Hazard">issued a recall</a> in partnership with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Pixy's battery can overheat, and there have been four reports of battery issues. One incident resulted in a minor battery fire, and a second resulted in a minor injury.<br/>
<br/>
The Pixy was sold on Snapchat's Pixy website and on Amazon between May 2022 and December 2023, with prices ranging from &#36;185 to &#36;250. Snap also sold extra batteries for &#36;16 to &#36;20.<br/>
<br/>
According to the recall notice, customers who purchased a Pixy Flying Camera should remove the battery and stop charging it. Snap is providing refunds for all customers who bought a Pixy.<br/>
<br/>
To get a refund, customers will need to <a href="https://support.pixy.com/hc/en-us">visit the Pixy support site</a> and follow the instructions. Pixy cameras must be returned to Snap, and batteries must be safely disposed of.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/snap/">Snap</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/snap-recalling-pixy-drones/">Snap Recalling and Refunding All Pixy Drones Due to Fire Risk</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/snap-recalling-and-refunding-all-pixy-drones-due-to-fire-risk.2418075/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The information comes from Apple Watch band collector and <em>MacRumors</em> forums member known as "mikedop," who explained that the pictured Sport Loop units originate from China. mikedop's source referred to the colors as "Navy Blue" and "Emerald," although they noted that these names might not be the official titles. Historically, the exact names of Apple's new color options are often lost in translation prior to their release.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reportedly prototypes around twice as many new color options as it actually releases, so it is not yet known if these ones were approved or not. Apple's annual spring refresh of its accessory colors is likely to launch in early March, perhaps alongside a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> color option.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-bands/">Apple Watch Bands</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/new-colors-heading-for-apple-spring-refresh/">&#039;Navy Blue&#039; and &#039;Emerald&#039; May Be Heading for Apple&#039;s Spring 2024 Accessory Refresh</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/navy-blue-and-emerald-may-be-heading-for-apples-spring-2024-accessory-refresh.2418055/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Max-Vision-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933922" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Max (formerly HBO Max) app on Apple Vision Pro</em></div><br/>
For entertainment, streaming and sports apps like Disney+, IMAX, Max, MLB, NBA, PGA TOUR Vision, and Red Bull TV have all been optimized to take full advantage of the Vision Pro's spatial design elements and immersive capabilities. In addition, soccer fans can subscribe to MLS Season Pass in the Apple TV app.<br/>
<br/>
With the NBA app and an NBA League Pass subscription, for example, Apple says basketball fans can use the Multiview feature to watch up to five broadcasts live or on demand, view real-time stats and scores at a glance, and more.<br/>
<br/>

Other apps optimized for the Vision Pro include Airmail, Box, CARROT Weather, djay, Fantastical, Facades, J.Crew, JigSpace, Lowe's, MindNode, MUBI, Navi, Night Sky, Numerics, OmniFocus, OmniPlan, Parcel, PCalc, Sky Guide, Tides, Voyager by ForeFlight, Wayfair, Webex, Zillow, Zoom, and many others. Microsoft 365 apps like Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, Teams, and Word also <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/announcing-microsoft-365-apps-available-on-apple-vision-pro/ba-p/4042505">natively support visionOS</a>. <br/>

Apple Arcade subscribers will have access to several optimized games for the Vision Pro, including Super Fruit Ninja, LEGO Builder's Journey, WHAT THE GOLF?, Cut the Rope 3, Jetpack Joyride 2, Patterned, Illustrated, Wylde Flowers, and more.<br/>

In addition, more than one million compatible iOS and iPadOS apps will automatically be available on the Vision Pro at launch. These apps have not been optimized for visionOS, so they will have a more iPad-like appearance. In the streaming space, for example, compatible apps that will be available include Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, and Peacock. Other compatible apps include Slack, Todoist, Comcast Xfinity, Sling TV, ESPN, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-vision-pro-over-600-native-apps/">Apple Announces More Than 600 Apps Already Optimized for Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-more-than-600-apps-already-optimized-for-vision-pro.2418054/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> has been finally pictured wearing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset. The photographs accompany a <em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/tim-cook-apple-vision-pro">Vanity Fair</a></em> article about the device, which leads on the digital cover of the magazine.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/vanity-fair-vision-pro-tim-cook.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933869" /><br/>
This is the first time the Apple CEO has been seen wearing the device since its unveiling at WWDC 2023 in June. Given that Cook is usually keen to model and be seen using Apple devices, particularly during keynote events and speeches, it's interesting that the company appears to have been a little more reticent to take the same approach with Vision Pro, until now.<br/>
<br/>
The article includes interview quotes from &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj;, Greg Joswiak, James Cameron, Jon Favreau, and others on their experience with &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;, how the headset was developed, and more. Here are some select quotes from the piece, which was written by Nick Bilton:<br/>
<blockquote>You can actually lay on your sofa and put the displays on your ceiling if you wish," Cook told me. "I watched the third season of [Ted] Lasso on my ceiling and it was unbelievable!" When I got home and hooked up my own Apple Vision Pro, I watched Ford v Ferrari on my ceiling, and with the spatial audio it felt like Ken Miles’s Ford GT40 was in the room with me. "I think meditation is on a different level than anything I’ve ever experienced, and I've meditated for a long time," Cook said. I've always had trouble meditating, and he was right about that too. "And I use it for productivity," Cook told me.<br/>
<br/>

"I would say my experience was religious," the director James Cameron told me when I asked him about his first encounter with the Apple Vision Pro. "I was skeptical at first. I don’t bow down before the great god of Apple, but I was really, really blown away."<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
If there's one consistent grumble about the Apple Vision Pro, it's about the size and weight. It's around 20 ounces, which might not sound like a lot, because you cook with ounces, you don't necessarily wear them. But that's the same as five sticks of butter—imagine walking around with five sticks of butter on your face all day. Carolina Cruz-Neira, a pioneer of virtual reality, told me that the way a device sits on your face really impacts how you respond to the technology. "I’ve been working in VR for over 30 years, and until we can get the scuba diving mask off your face and we make it less noticeable, we’re not going to make this a mass-adoption technology," Cruz-Neira said. "And the size and weight of these scuba diving masks are not going to be solved in a year."<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
"There’s nothing we could have done to make it lighter or smaller," Richard Howarth [Apple VP of industrial design] explained. "This is the state of the art." Everyone else I spoke to at Apple proffered a similar sentiment. "It feels like we've reached into the future and grabbed this product," Joswiak said to me. "You’re putting the future on your face." As did Rockwell, who told me: "We packed just about as much technology as you could possibly pack into that small of a form factor."</blockquote>You can read the full review on the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/tim-cook-apple-vision-pro"><em>Vanity Fair</em> website</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iron-clad grasp on the top spot of <em><a href="https://fortune.com/ranking/worlds-most-admired-companies/">Fortune</a></em>'s "World's Most Admired Companies" shows no signs of weakening, with the tech giant finishing ahead of the 300+ pack for the 17th consecutive year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Logo-Spotlight.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912758" /><br/>
Apple was placed above Microsoft in second place, followed by Amazon in third. All three companies have rounded out the top three for the fifth year in a row. Notably, Nvidia, whose GPU chips are powering servers for generative AI around the world, soared to its highest-ever ranking at number 10. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Fortune</em> ranks companies through a collection of "key attributes of reputation," such as innovation, quality of management, social responsibility, use of corporate assets, financial soundness, quality of products and services, and global competitiveness. Apple topped the list in every category.<br/>
<br/>
As it has in the past, <em>Fortune</em> collaborated with partner Korn Ferry on its survey of corporate reputations. <br/>
<blockquote>To select our 50 All-Stars, Korn Ferry asked 3,720 executives, directors, and securities analysts who had responded to the industry surveys to select the 10 companies they admired most. They chose from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last year’s surveys, plus those that finished in the top 20% of their industry. Anyone could vote for any company in any industry.</blockquote>To see the full ranking of the World's Most Admired Companies, visit <a href="https://fortune.com/ranking/worlds-most-admired-companies/"><em>Fortune</em>'s website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortune-com/">Fortune</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-most-admired-company-17th-year/">Apple Tops &#039;World&#039;s Most Admired Company&#039; List for 17th Consecutive Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tops-worlds-most-admired-company-list-for-17th-consecutive-year.2418046/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is putting the final retail preparations in place for the U.S. launch of its Apple Vision Pro headset on Friday, with dedicated areas in flagship retail stores where customers can test out the device. But Apple's Fifth Avenue retail store in New York appears to be getting special treatment, with a giant replica Vision Pro headset being constructed within the glass cube.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/cube-store-vision-pro-construction.jpeg" alt="" width="1536" height="864" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933856" /><br/>
Photos shared by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/31/apple-vision-pro-fifth-avenue/">9to5Mac</a></em> show scaffolding in front of the glowing Apple logo in the giant skylight above the centerpiece stairway down to the store, where a window display is being erected in the distinctive shape of the Vision Pro goggles. <br/>
<br/>
It's unclear whether the display is unique to "The Cube" or is set to appear in other retail stores around the country, but Apple is certainly hoping to make a splash at possibly Apple's most high-profile U.S. store, and the promotional installation is sure to catch the eyes of passersby and further rouse queueing customers in case they weren't excited enough already.<br/>
<br/>
Steve Jobs originally hired firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson to help with the design of Apple's iconic Fifth Avenue store. He and Peter Bohlin worked closely to create the centerpiece stairway made entirely of glass, the material that would become Apple's signature architectural statement in its flagship stores. The Cube boasted 50,000 visitors a week in its first year, and by 2010 grossed more per square foot than any store in the world. <br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to limit sales of the Vision Pro to customers in the United States to start with, before expanding availability to other countries later in the year. The Vision Pro starts at &#36;3,500, and online pre-orders ship to customers on launch day, February 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-vision-pro-launch-fifth-avenue/">Apple&#039;s Fifth Avenue Store Vision Pro Installation Is Shaping Up to Be a Spectacle</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-fifth-avenue-store-vision-pro-installation-is-shaping-up-to-be-a-spectacle.2418043/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has extended its modem chip licensing agreement with Qualcomm through March 2027, Qualcomm said today during its first earnings call of 2024. Apple's existing agreement has now been extended for two years, so we can expect to see Qualcomm modems in the next several <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> generations.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886940" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/5G-Modem-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple has been working on developing its own 5G modem chip in-house for the last several years. The technology would keep it from having to rely on Qualcomm for 5G chips, but Apple's progress has seen several delays.<br/>
<br/>
In November 2023, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple's work on a modem chip had been postponed until late 2025 or 2026, and it is possible it could see further delays. Apple was initially aiming to have an Apple-designed modem chip ready to go by 2024, but it missed that target. The company then wanted to introduce the modem chip in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> that would launch in spring 2025, but it will not be able to make that goal either.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In an also not surprising development, on the <a href="https://twitter.com/Qualcomm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Qualcomm</a> call, it was mentioned:<br><br>&quot;Apple exercised its unilateral option to extend its global patent license agreement for an additional two years, taking the existing agreement through to March 2027&quot;</p>&mdash; Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BenBajarin/status/1752825042466160735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Gurman said at the time that Apple was "years away" from creating a chip that is able to perform as well or better than chips from Qualcomm.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly run into issues with the Intel code that it has been using from its acquisition of Intel's modem chip business. Apple has had to rewrite code, and adding new features has caused existing features to break. Apple also has to avoid infringing on Qualcomm's patents during its modem development.<br/>
<br/>
The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro models</a> set to be released in 2024 are rumored to be using Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 modem with improved carrier aggregation, and a more power efficient transceiver.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g/">5G</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/">Apple Extends Modem Licensing Deal With Qualcomm Through March 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-extends-modem-licensing-deal-with-qualcomm-through-march-2027.2418014/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Vision Pro Battery Pack Power Cable is Removable</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The cable that connects the Vision Pro battery pack to the headset for power purposes appears to be fixed in place, but it can in fact be removed if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-battery-pack.jpg" alt="" width="1640" height="1060" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929544" /><br/>
Journalist Ray Wong was able to use a SIM card pin to "unlock" the cable, and after he did that, it was able to be removed from the battery pack. There is a small hole located next to the cable, which is apparently a locking mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
The cable that attaches the battery pack to the headset looks similar to a Lightning cable, but it has too many pins to be Lightning. Instead, it is a proprietary cable that won't be able to be connected to other accessories or used for another purpose.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">l used a SIM card push pin to &quot;unlock&quot; the cable connected to the Apple Vision Pro battery pack. It popped right out. <a href="https://t.co/tShScpMlvr">pic.twitter.com/tShScpMlvr</a></p>&mdash; Ray Wong (@raywongy) <a href="https://twitter.com/raywongy/status/1752787114071298255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple likely made the cable removable so that it can be swapped out without the need to replace the entire battery pack should the cable get damaged in some way.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro ships with one battery, and additional modules can be purchased for &#36;199 each. Each battery powers the Vision Pro for somewhere around two to three hours depending on content. The battery also has a USB-C port that can be used with a USB-C cable for charging the battery, with passthrough charging supported.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/vision-pro-battery-removable-cable/">Apple Vision Pro Battery Pack Power Cable is Removable</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-battery-pack-power-cable-is-removable.2417998/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.4 update to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its launch. The public beta comes a day after Apple released the developer beta. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4 introduces some of the features in the iOS 17.4 beta, such as new emoji characters. We don't know what Mac-specific features are included, but nothing new was found in the developer beta. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-seeds-first-public-beta-of-macos-14-4/">Apple Seeds First Public Beta of macOS 14.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-public-beta-of-macos-14-4.2417985/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.0.2 update for the Vision Pro headset, according to developer <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolas09F9/status/1752756819825508519">Nicolás Álvarez</a>. The software comes a week after the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-1/">visionOS 1.0.1 update</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
There is no word on what is included in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.2, and while the Vision Pro has yet to be released, review units are in the hands of members of the media, and they will be able to download and install this update.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.2 <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214070">addresses a WebKit vulnerability</a> that Apple says may have been actively exploited. The issue was also fixed in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.1 for developers, but the fix is in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.2 for those updating from &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that Vision Pro owners will have a day one update to install this software when they begin receiving their headsets on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro will ship with version one of the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; software, but we are expecting to see &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 2 with new features at WWDC in June.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2/">Apple Releases visionOS 1.0.2 Two Days Before Vision Pro Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2-two-days-before-vision-pro-launch.2417983/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Webex <a href="https://blog.webex.com/hybrid-work/seamless-collaboration-webex-on-apple-tv-4k/">today announced</a> the launch of its new Webex app that's designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K. The app is designed to allow hybrid workers to join meetings from the biggest screen they have, which is often a television.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/webex-apple-tv.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="636" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933816" /><br/>
Users are able to scan the QR code on the sign-in screen and log in to the Webex app on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; in order to join a meeting. Participating in a chat will require wirelessly connecting an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K to use the iOS device as a microphone and video camera.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has previously used the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; connection for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, but the functionality is available to third-party apps as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/webex-apple-tv-participants.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="688" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933817" /><br/>
Webex says that users can expect "crystal-clear audio and video," with the app offering a preview of video and microphone status ahead of when a meeting is joined. Calendar integration is available, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Remote can be used for browsing through meetings and accessing in-meeting controls such as the camera on the connected iOS device.<br/>
<br/>
Up to 25 simultaneous attendees can be shown on one screen with the Webex app for the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K, and the app can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> on the device. To use Webex on a TV, users must have a second-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K or later and an iOS device with either <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/webex-apple-tv-4k-app/">Webex Now Available on Apple TV 4K for Video Calls</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/webex-now-available-on-apple-tv-4k-for-video-calls.2417973/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the Mid 2012 model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624">obsolete products list</a> worldwide, according to its website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/13-Inch-MacBook-Pro-Mid-2012.jpg" alt="" width="1842" height="1036" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833351" /><br/>
Released in June 2012, this 13-inch MacBook Pro model was the last Mac with a built-in CD/DVD drive sold by Apple, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/27/apple-discontinues-non-retina-macbook-pro/">remained for sale until October 2016</a> as a lower-priced option. Apple continues to sell an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive">external SuperDrive</a> for customers who need a CD/DVD drive, but a USB-C adapter is required to use it with modern MacBooks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple considers a device to be "technologically obsolete" once more than seven years have passed since the company last distributed it for sale. Apple says MacBooks "may be eligible for an extended battery-only repair period for up to 10 years from when the product was last distributed for sale, subject to parts availability."<br/>
<br/>
On the software side, Apple dropped support for the Mid 2012 model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with macOS Big Sur in 2020.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Vision Pro headset comes with an external battery pack with a capacity of 3,166 mAh, compared to the 3,274 mAh battery found in the iPhone 15 Pro, although the voltages are different so the measurement alone can't be considered equivalent. Reviewers have also reported that there are significant size and weight differences between the two.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-battery-pack.jpg" alt="" width="1640" height="1060" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929544" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a>, the Vision Pro battery is about the width and height of an iPhone 15 Pro, but thicker. Weight-wise, it is also heavier: About 325g, compared to 187g for an iPhone 15 Pro. "It's closer in thickness and weight to two iPhone 15's than it is to one," according to Gruber.<br/>
<br/>
Marques Brownlee in his <a href="https://youtu.be/SaneSRqePVY?feature=shared&t=262">unboxing video</a> also described the battery as "pretty heavy," and compared it to phones with larger capacity 5,000+ mAh batteries that feel "much lighter." We'll probably have to wait for a teardown to find out what the additional weight can be attributed to.<br/>
<br/>
The external battery pack that comes with the Vision Pro is silver, has a proprietary connector for attaching to the headset, and a USB-C port for charging via the included 30W wall charger. The proprietary connector is connected to the Vision Pro by rotating it a quarter turn to lock it into place. <br/>
<br/>
For those considering buying an additional &#36;200 battery pack, one thing to bear in mind is that Vision Pro batteries are not hot-swappable: As Gruber notes, there is no built-in reserve battery in the headset, so when the power cable is disconnected, Vision Pro immediately powers off. A manual reboot is therefore required to switch batteries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the Vision Pro provides up to two hours of battery life overall, and up to 2.5 hours for 2D video playback specifically. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/apple-vision-pro/">several reviewers</a> claim to have gotten up to three hours out of a single charge in general use, with one reviewer saying they were able to watch a three-hour movie on a single charge. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Vision Pro Battery specs:<br><br>3166 MAh<br>35.9 Wh<br>Output 13V 6A max <br>Model number: A2781 <a href="https://t.co/XoSbxhHEHA">pic.twitter.com/XoSbxhHEHA</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1752464226092798125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
In terms of battery life, it doesn't make sense to compare the Vision Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro, given that the former undoubtedly draws a lot more juice to power an array of much more sophisticated cameras, sensors, displays, speakers, and microphones.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Vision Pro launches in the U.S. on Friday, February 2. Apple has said the Vision Pro will launch in additional countries later this year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has failed to properly comply with a court order that requires non-App Store purchasing options be made available to third-party developers, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> has told a judge (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/apple-accused-by-epic-of-failing-to-fix-app-store-as-court-asked">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>

The Supreme Court earlier this month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/">declined</a> to hear separate requests from both Apple and ‌&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;‌ in their three-year-long lawsuit against each other regarding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules. As a result, Apple is able to continue to disallow third-party payment processing within apps, but it must allow developers to direct customers to a non-App Store purchasing option for digital goods.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/">made changes to its U.S. App Store policies</a>, and now allows apps to feature a single link to a developer website that leads to an in-app purchase alternative. However, Apple plans to continue to collect a 12 to 27 percent commission on content bought this way. The commission applies to transactions for digital goods and services that take place on a developers website within seven days after a user taps through an External Purchase Link to an external website.<br/>
<br/>
Epic likely wishes to contest this aspect of the change in particular, as well as Apple's implementation of them. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;‌ CEO Tim Sweeney on January 16 took to X (formerly Twitter) to criticize the‌ changes as soon as they were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/">announced</a>, and said that it would dispute Apple's "bad-faith compliance plan" in District Court. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A quick summary of glaring problems we&#39;ve found so far:<br><br>1) Apple has introduced an anticompetitive new 27% tax on web purchases. Apple has never done this before, and it kills price competition. Developers can&#39;t offer digital items more cheaply on the web after paying a… <a href="https://t.co/YkHuapG7xa">pic.twitter.com/YkHuapG7xa</a></p>&mdash; Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747408148799881390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Epic said in a filing Tuesday that it "disputes Apple's compliance" with previously ordered changes and said it will explain the "non-compliance" in a forthcoming filing.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Apple wants &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; to pay &#36;73.4 million in legal fees after Apple won the antitrust case brought against it by the North Carolinian games maker. Apple bases the claim on Epic's original violation of its developer agreement, when its <em>Fortnite</em> game offered an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/fornite-adds-direct-payment-option-on-ios/">in-app payment alternative</a> on the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌. Epic previously accepted that it would owe damages if it lost its antitrust claims against Apple. Now that it has, Apple has issued the bill.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-non-compliance-court-order-epic/">Apple Failed to Comply With App Store Court Order, Epic Tells Judge</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-failed-to-comply-with-app-store-court-order-epic-tells-judge.2417949/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17.4, currently in beta, Apple is adding audio transcripts to the Podcasts app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, meaning you'll be able to read along to your favorite podcasts as they are spoken.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/podcast-app-transcript.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932875" /><br/>
Apple is adding support for auto-generated transcripts in its Podcasts app, offering users another way to enjoy podcast content rather than simply listening to what is being said. <br/>
<br/>
If you're familiar with lyrics in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, it's very similar. When playing a podcast, simply tap the speech bubble icon at the bottom-left corner of the fullscreen media playback screen. <br/>
<br/>
Tap the auto-generated transcript that appears to make it fill the screen. The transcript automatically scrolls and highlights the text currently being spoken as the episode plays, or you can scroll through the transcript manually, and even tap on a sentence to jump to that point in the podcast. Text selections can also be highlighted for copying and pasting elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>

In addition, a Search button at the bottom of the screen lets you search the transcript for specific words or phrases and jump to that point in the transcript, where you can then tap to skip to the audio track. <br/>
<br/>
Transcripts can also be accessed from the Up Next section in the Home tab. Simply press and hold a podcast episode to reveal the View Transcript option in the dropdown menu. And if you're on the episode details page, tap the ellipsis (three dots) button top-right to reveal the same option.<br/>
<br/>

As of writing, not all podcast episodes have transcripts right now, but Apple says that transcripts for back catalog episodes are being added over time. Transcripts are available in English, French, German, and Spanish, and podcast hosts also have the option to upload their own transcripts rather than using the automatically generated version.<br/>
<br/>
The transcripts feature is coming as part of Apple's iOS 17.4 update, which available to developers at the current time. Apple plans to release it to the public in March. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-search-transcripts-podcasts-app/">iOS 17.4: Using Apple&#039;s New Podcast Transcript Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-using-apples-new-podcast-transcript-feature.2417947/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
