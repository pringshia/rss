		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 will give iPhone users greater control over Home Screen app icon arrangement, according to sources familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-Home-Screen-Gradient.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943009" /><em>Home Screen on iOS 17</em></div><br/>
While app icons will likely remain locked to an invisible grid system on the Home Screen, to ensure there is some uniformity, our sources say that users will be able to arrange icons more freely on iOS 18. For example, we expect that the update will introduce the ability to create blank spaces, rows, and columns between app icons.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman was first to report that the iPhone would get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-more-customizable-home-screen-rumor/">"more customizable" Home Screen</a> starting with iOS 18. It is already possible to customize the Home Screen and create blank app icons with apps such as Shortcuts and Widgetsmith, but Apple's own personalization options will be more convenient and official.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone users have already been able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/customize-lock-screen-ios/">customize the Lock Screen</a> since iOS 16, and we expect the Home Screen to receive similar treatment with iOS 18. The update will introduce additional customization options for the Home Screen, according to our sources, and this could result in the biggest Home Screen revamp in several years.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will announce iOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC in June. Other features and changes rumored for the update include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI functionality</a> for Siri and multiple apps, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">RCS support in the Messages app</a> for improved messaging between iPhones and Android devices, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">design changes</a>, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-home-screen-app-icon-customization/">Sources: iOS 18 Lets Users Customize Layout of Home Screen App Icons</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sources-ios-18-lets-users-customize-layout-of-home-screen-app-icons.2422709/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 will feature a revamped Home Screen that is "more customizable," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-24/how-strong-is-the-justice-department-case-against-apple-it-could-be-stronger-lu5ii64n"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. He revealed this information in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-24/how-strong-is-the-justice-department-case-against-apple-it-could-be-stronger-lu5ii64n"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, but he did not provide any specific details.<br/>

<br/>
With iOS 18, Gurman believes Apple will focus on new "AI tools that help manage your daily life" more than "ChatGPT-like generative AI features."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman reiterated that at least some Apple employees believe that iOS 18 will be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/">biggest software update in the iPhone's history</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> today confirmed that the Vision Pro headset will go on sale in China later this year (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Vision-Pro-Person.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913199" /><br/>
Responding to a question from the press at the China Development Forum in Beijing, Cook confirmed that Apple's first spatial computer will launch in the country in 2024. He added that Apple will continue to increase research and development investment in China. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/tim-cook-visits-shanghai/">Cook visited</a> Apple's new Jing'an store in Shanghai.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first explicit confirmation of a specific country other than the United States that the Vision Pro will launch in this year. Apple says that the Vision Pro will launch in additional countries later in 2024, but the company has not provided a more specific timeframe or, until now, indicated exactly where the headset will become available. Last month, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said he believed the Vision Pro would launch internationally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/">before Apple's annual developers conference WWDC</a>, which typically takes place in the first week of June.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has a new home at Canada's second-largest indoor shopping mall. Following months of construction, the new Apple Square One retail store opened its doors today in Mississauga, Ontario, just west of Toronto. The store is now located above the Food Central food court on the second floor of the mall, across from Sephora.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Square-One-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942854" /><em>The new Apple Square One via <a href="https://twitter.com/theartistchair">Kyle</a></em></div><br/>
The store's first visitors were greeted with a round of applause from Apple's team members. <em>MacRumors</em> reader <a href="https://twitter.com/theartistchair/status/1771534704568623371">Kyle attended the grand opening</a> and shared photos with us, providing a first look at the curved glass facade and expansive interior.<br/>
<br/>
On the positive side, the new store is much larger than Apple's previous location in the mall, which was often overcrowded. The original store closed its doors for good on Thursday evening, after nearly 15 years of serving customers. Another plus is that the store is the first in Canada to offer a dedicated Apple Pickup station where customers can conveniently collect their online orders placed on Apple.com and in the Apple Store app.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Pickup-Square-One.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942858" /><em>Apple Pickup in the new Apple Square One via <a href="https://twitter.com/theartistchair">Kyle</a></em></div><br/>
On the negative side, the store lacks some of Apple's latest retail design elements that were first introduced last year at the relocated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/apple-tysons-corner-store-now-open/">Apple Tysons Corner in Virginia</a> and all-new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/15/apple-battersea-opens-today/">Apple Battersea in London, England</a>, such as a Genius Bar with varied table and seating heights for improved accessibility, and an Apple Watch Studio for mixing and matching case and band combinations. Customers can still receive hardware support from a Genius at the store, and participate in free creative sessions through the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/today/squareone/">Today at Apple program</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The new Apple Square One is the company's fourth modern store in Canada, alongside Apple Fairview and Apple Eaton Centre in Toronto, and Apple Pacific Centre in Vancouver. All of Apple's other stores in Canada have a classic design. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/01/apple-store-update-plans/">leaked document last year</a> revealed that Apple has considered relocating its Sainte-Catherine store in Montréal, Québec as early as 2025, but the company has not publicly confirmed these plans.<br/>
<br/>
"Come say hello," says Apple, on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/squareone/">Apple Square One page</a>. "We can't wait to see you there."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/23/relocated-apple-square-one-opens/">Apple&#039;s First Store in Canada With Dedicated Pickup Station Now Open</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-store-in-canada-with-dedicated-pickup-station-now-open.2422633/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We're getting closer to the launch of new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, while rumors about iOS 18 are continuing to ramp up with this week's surprise revelation that Apple has been talking to Google and others about potentially helping power the generative AI features expected to be a major part of this year's update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/combine_images.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942701" /><br/>
Other news this week saw the release of iOS 17.4.1 and iPadOS 17.4.1 updates with bug fixes, but we're still awaiting an update to address some of the problems introduced in macOS 14.4 earlier this month. We've also been continuing to keep our eye on the iPhone 16 lineup due in September and upcoming AirPods updates, so read on for details on all of these stories!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18: Apple in Talks With Google to Bring Gemini AI Features to iPhone</h2><br/>
Apple is in active discussions with Google to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-google-gemini-ios-18-iphone/">license some of its Gemini generative AI technology for the iPhone</a> starting as early as iOS 18 later this year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. Apple has also been talking to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-iphone-ai-talks-google-openai-ongoing/">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/">Baidu</a> about their generative AI models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/google-gemini.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941761" /><br/>
iOS 18 is widely rumored to include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features for Siri</a> and a range of built-in Apple apps on the iPhone, including Messages, Apple Music, Health, Shortcuts, Pages, Keynote, Numbers, and others.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New iPads Likely to Begin Shipping in April</h2><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-likely-to-begin-shipping-in-april/">new iPad Pro models with OLED displays will likely begin shipping to customers in April</a>, according to Ross Young, CEO of display industry research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
Young expects Apple to announce new iPads <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-likely-to-begin-shipping-in-april/">in late March or early April</a>. Alongside the new iPad Pro models, he also expects an updated 10.9-inch iPad Air and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">first-ever 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> to be released.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases iOS 17.4.1 Update for iPhone</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-releases-ios-17-4-1/">released iOS 17.4.1 for the iPhone and iPadOS 17.4.1 for the iPad</a>. The minor software updates includes bug fixes and security improvements, such as a fix for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/ios-17-4-1-qr-code-scanning-bug/">QR code issue on the iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.4.1-Feature-Joe-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940545" /><br/>
We're still waiting on the first beta of iOS 17.5 to be released as of the time this newsletter was sent out. That update is expected to introduce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">new Web Distribution option for qualifying iPhone apps in the EU</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Every iPhone 16 Rumor We've Covered So Far</h2><br/>
While the iPhone 16 series is still months away from being unveiled, there are already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/every-iphone-16-rumor-weve-covered-so-far/">many rumored features and changes</a> for the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
We've recently updated our list of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/every-iphone-16-rumor-weve-covered-so-far/">every iPhone 16 rumor that we have covered so far</a>, so be sure to check it out for the latest expectations. One recent rumor is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/">even thinner bezels</a> for the iPhone 16 models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 16 series in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>macOS Sonoma 14.4: Reasons Not to Update</h2><br/>
Since Apple unveiled macOS Sonoma 14.4 earlier this month, the transition to the latest software update has not been entirely smooth for everyone, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/do-not-update-macos-sonoma-14-4/">number of issues have been reported by users</a> that significantly impact their daily workflow.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Reasons-to-Not-Upgrade-to-macOS-Sonoma-14.4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941874" /><br/>
If you anticipate that any of these problems could significantly impact your daily operations or productivity, it may be prudent to delay updating to the latest version of macOS Sonoma until Apple addresses these concerns with a subsequent fix. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>The MacRumors Show: Apple's Four Upcoming AirPods Models</h2><br/>
On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/the-macrumors-show-four-new-airpods/">latest episode of <em>The MacRumors Show</em> podcast</a>, our hosts Hartley Charlton and Dan Barbera discussed circulating rumors on four upcoming models of AirPods, including two variants of fourth-generation AirPods, a very minor refresh of the AirPods Max, and next-generation AirPods Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/The-MacRumors-Show-FOUR-New-AirPods-Models-Coming-Soon-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942663" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/the-macrumors-show-new-ipad-air-upgrade/">Last week's episode</a> saw Dan and Harley discussing whether the next-generation iPad Air models will be a big enough upgrade for customers. Apple is expected to release a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air, but no major design changes are expected for the mid-range tablet. Key new features expected include the M2 chip and a landscape front camera.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The latest 13-inch and 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models have been available for two weeks now, and <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera has been using the 15-inch version since it launched. Over on our YouTube channel, Dan shared a review now that he's been able to spend some quality time with the machine.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="The Honest Truth About Apple's M3 MacBook Air" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YYAzLxLuMjg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is a perfect all-around laptop, and the Air models are what we recommend for most people. In fact, the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is more machine than the average consumer likely even needs. For web browsing, sending emails, and other simple tasks, a more affordable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is more than enough, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/best-buy-macbook-air-all-time-low/">M1 MacBook Air is even available</a> at a super low &#36;650 price right now.<br/>
<br/>
For photo editing, video editing, and tasks that require a little more power, even the base model M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with 8GB Unified Memory is more than enough for many people. Upgrading the memory will give you a bit more leeway in terms of future proofing, and adding more storage is a good idea if you need space for file storage, games, and apps.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, the M3 has faster CPU and GPU speeds, hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading for 3D rendering and games, Wi-Fi 6E support, and support for two displays in clamshell mode. If you need these options, or don't mind shelling out a bit more money for a machine that will last longer, it's worth getting the M3, but we also think the more affordable &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models are perfectly great for many people.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/m3-macbook-air-review/">Review: Two Weeks With the M3 MacBook Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-two-weeks-with-the-m3-macbook-air.2422577/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has ended a project to develop microLED displays in-house, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/apple-scraps-plan-to-design-display-for-watch-in-house-cuts-jobs">according to <em>Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></a> in a reversal of his prior reporting on the development of the technology. Apple invested billions in developing microLED displays, with plans to first add microLED to the Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-watch-ultra-2-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939712" /><br/>
MicroLED was too expensive and too complex for Apple to design, so Apple is now reorganizing its display engineering teams and laying off employees in the U.S. and Asia. Some of the displaced employees may be able to find other roles in the company, and others will be provided with severance.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors that Apple had canceled plans for an Apple Watch with microLED <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled-for-now/">first surfaced in February</a> when supplier ams OSRAM said that a "cornerstone project" related to microLED had been canceled. Soon after, there were rumors that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/microled-apple-watch-potential-supplier-lost/">ended its relationship</a> with Kulicke &amp; Soffa, another company in the advanced display market.<br/>
<br/>
Both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/kuo-says-microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled/">analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/blog/apple-cancels-microled-project">Display Supply Chain Consultants</a> confirmed that Apple had canceled work on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a> after these rumors, but Gurman claimed that Apple was still working on the device. In <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fmarkgurman%2Fstatus%2F1763297383046365515&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">a now-deleted tweet</a>, Gurman said that ams OSRAM was "one supplier" on the project, and that there were several other suppliers Apple was working with. "I doubt it was canceled," he wrote. <br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> and <em>ETNews</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-still-dedicated-microled-apple-watch-ultra/">also suggested</a> that ams OSRAM was replaced due to a performance drop and that Apple had another supplier lined up, but it appears that information was incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
MicroLED technology uses microscopic LEDs for individual pixels. It's more energy efficient than traditional LED, offers improved contrast, and has faster response times. Colors are brighter and better, and there's no risk of burn-in as there is with OLED. Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/kuo-says-microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled/">said to have abandoned the project</a> because it was not economically viable.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman claims that Apple will stick with OLED display technology for the Apple Watch "for now," but that the company is "eyeing microLED for other projects down the road." Apple is "identifying" potential new suppliers and processes for microLED, but it "won't likely happen anytime soon."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-ends-microled-apple-watch-development/">Apple Drops Plans to Develop MicroLED Displays for Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-drops-plans-to-develop-microled-displays-for-apple-watch.2422569/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon has further discounted Apple's brand new 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, now reaching &#36;95 off the original price. Only one model is on sale: the 256GB 15-inch M3 MacBook Air in Starlight is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX251F4X%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,204.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,299.00.<br/>

<br/>
This is the best price we've seen to date on the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, and it beats the previous record low price seen on Amazon by about &#36;30. Amazon provides an estimated delivery date of Monday, March 25 for the fastest option and Wednesday, March 27 for free delivery.<br/>

<br/>
This version of the 15-inch MacBook Air just launched earlier in the month, alongside updated models of the 13-inch size as well. Both of the new MacBook Air machines include the M3 chip and focus on internal upgrades. Apple did not change the design of the MacBook Air with the 2024 update, using the same design that was first introduced in 2022. <br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Steve-Jobs-Business-Card.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942677" /><br/>
The business card is from 1983, and it has been authenticated by well-known memorabilia grading service PSA, according to the auction listing. It features Apple's old six-color logo, and it lists the company's former address of 10495 Bandley Drive, in Cupertino, California. Jobs is listed as the Chairman of Apple's Board of Directors.<br/>
<br/>
RR Auction believes this sale has set a new record-high price for a signed business card.<br/>
<br/>
Jobs passed away in 2011 at the age of 56. Throughout his career, he was reluctant to sign autographs, so items with his signature on them often sell for large sums of money. Last year, for example, a check signed by Jobs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/11/steve-jobs-check-100k-auction/">sold for over &#36;100,000 at auction</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/steve-jobs/">Steve Jobs</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/steve-jobs-signed-business-card-auction/">Steve Jobs Signed Business Card Fetches Over &#36;180,000 at Auction</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/steve-jobs-signed-business-card-fetches-over-180-000-at-auction.2422557/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/apples-four-new-airpods-models-coming-soon/id1602394741?i=1000650131936">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss Apple's rumored plan to refresh the entire AirPods lineup with a series of new models. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9iStGe7ItWM?si=PFQjoZlYbtHwdZan" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The fourth-generation AirPods will reportedly feature a new design with a better fit, improved sound quality, and an updated charging case with a USB-C port. For the first time ever, Apple is also apparently planning to offer a higher-end version of the AirPods with active noise cancelation and a speaker in the charging case to play a sound for easy location via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> are expected to be a minor refresh, simply swapping the Lightning port of the current model for USB-C and adding Bluetooth 5.3 support. New color options are also a possibility, but it looks like Apple's most premium audio device will continue to miss out on the H2 chip, Adaptive Audio, improved Active Noise Cancellation, skin-detect sensors, sweat and water resistance, the ultra wideband chip, Precision Finding, and support for additional charging methods. <br/>
<br/>
Both the fourth-generation AirPods and the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are expected to launch in late 2024. Further in the future, Apple is expected to launch the third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> with an updated design that is focused on improved comfort and a faster chip.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has held discussions with Baidu about using the Chinese company's generative AI model to power some of the iPhone's rumored generative AI features, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-held-talks-with-chinas-baidu-over-ai-for-its-devices-76879b7f"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. As previously reported, Apple is also said to have held similar discussions <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-iphone-ai-talks-google-openai-ongoing/">with Google and OpenAI</a>, the company behind the popular ChatGPT chatbot.<br/>
<br/>

If these partnerships move forward, it is likely that Baidu would power some of Apple's generative AI features in China, while other companies like Google or OpenAI would serve as partners in the U.S. and other countries. China requires generative AI models to receive local regulatory approval, and Baidu's Ernie chatbot is on the approved list, but Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbots are not available in the country.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has repeatedly teased that it has generative AI announcements <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">to share later this year</a>, and this likely refers to iOS 18. The software update is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">rumored to include new generative AI features</a> for a range of iPhone features and apps, including Siri, Spotlight, Apple Music, Health, Messages, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, Shortcuts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 16 models are rumored to feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">upgraded Neural Engine</a> with "significantly" more cores, which could result in some of iOS 18's generative AI features being exclusive to those models. iPhone 15 models have a 16-core Neural Engine.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 will be previewed at Apple's developers conference <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC</a> in June, so we're just a few months away from learning about these generative AI plans.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/">Apple&#039;s Potential Partners for iOS 18 Generative AI Features Include Google, OpenAI, and Baidu</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-potential-partners-for-ios-18-generative-ai-features-include-google-openai-and-baidu.2422541/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An unpatchable vulnerability has been discovered in Apple's M-series chips that allows attackers to extract secret encryption keys from Macs under certain conditions, according to a newly published <a href="https://gofetch.fail/files/gofetch.pdf">academic research paper</a> (via <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/hackers-can-extract-secret-encryption-keys-from-apples-mac-chips/">ArsTechnica</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/m1-vs-m2-air-feature-toned-down.jpg" alt="" width="2112" height="1188" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-855090" /><br/>
Named "<a href="https://gofetch.fail">GoFetch</a>," the type of cyber attack described involves Data Memory-Dependent Prefetchers (DMPs), which try to predict what data the computer will need next and retrieve it in advance. This is meant to make processing faster, but it can unintentionally reveal information about what the computer is doing.<br/>
<br/>
The paper finds that DMPs, especially the ones in Apple's processors, pose a significant threat to the security provided by constant-time programming models, which are used to write programs so that they take the same amount of time to run, no matter what data they're dealing with.<br/>
<br/>
The constant-time programming model is meant to protect against side-channel attacks, or types of attacks where someone can gain sensitive information from a computer system without directly accessing it (by observing certain patterns, for example). The idea is that if all operations take the same amount of time, there's less for an attacker to observe and exploit.  <br/>
<br/>
However, the paper finds that DMPs, particularly in Apple silicon, can leak information even if the program is designed not to reveal any patterns in how it accesses memory. The new research finds that the DMPs can sometimes confuse memory content, which causes it to treat the data as an address to perform memory access, which goes against the constant-time model.<br/>
<br/>
The authors present GoFetch as a new type of attack that can exploit this vulnerability in DMPs to extract encryption keys from secure software. The attack works against some popular encryption algorithms that are thought to be resistant to side-channel attacks, including both traditional (e.g. OpenSSL Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, Go RSA decryption) and post-quantum (e.g. CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium) cryptographic methods.<br/>
<br/>
In an email to <em>ArsTechnica</em>, the authors explained:<br/>
<blockquote>Prefetchers usually look at addresses of accessed data (ignoring values of accessed data) and try to guess future addresses that might be useful. The DMP is different in this sense as in addition to addresses it also uses the data values in order to make predictions (predict addresses to go to and prefetch). In particular, if a data value "looks like" a pointer, it will be treated as an "address" (where in fact it's actually not!) and the data from this "address" will be brought to the cache. The arrival of this address into the cache is visible, leaking over cache side channels.<br/>
<br/>
Our attack exploits this fact. We cannot leak encryption keys directly, but what we can do is manipulate intermediate data inside the encryption algorithm to look like a pointer via a chosen input attack. The DMP then sees that the data value "looks like" an address, and brings the data from this "address" into the cache, which leaks the "address." We don't care about the data value being prefetched, but the fact that the intermediate data looked like an address is visible via a cache channel and is sufficient to reveal the secret key over time.</blockquote>In summary, the paper shows that the DMP feature in Apple silicon CPUs could be used to bypass security measures in cryptography software that were thought to protect against such leaks, potentially allowing attackers to access sensitive information, such as a 2048-bit RSA key, in some cases in less than an hour. <br/>
<br/>
According to the authors, the flaw in Apple's chips cannot be patched directly. Instead, the attack vector can only be reduced by building defenses into third-party cryptographic software that could result in an extreme performance degradation when executing the cryptographic operations, particularly on the earlier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chips. The DMP on the M3, Apple's latest chip, has a special bit that developers can invoke to disable it, but the researchers aren't yet sure what kind of penalty will occur when this performance optimization is turned off. <br/>
<br/>
As <em>ArsTechnica</em> notes, this isn't the first time researchers have identified threats in Apple DMPs. Research documented in 2022 discovered one such threat in both the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and Apple's A14 Bionic chip for iPhones, which resulted in the "<a href="https://www.prefetchers.info/about/">Augury</a>" attack. However, this attack was ultimately unable to extract the sensitive data when constant-time practices were used.<br/>
<blockquote>"GoFetch shows that the DMP is significantly more aggressive than previously thought and thus poses a much greater security risk," the researchers claim on their website. "Specifically, we find that any value loaded from memory is a candidate for being dereferenced (literally!). This allows us to sidestep many of Augury's limitations and demonstrate end-to-end attacks on real constant-time code."</blockquote>DMP-style attacks are not common, and the researchers informed Apple of the vulnerability in December 2023. Users concerned about the vulnerability are advised to check for GoFetch mitigation updates that become available in future macOS updates for any of the encryption protocols known to be vulnerable. Apple representatives declined to comment on the record when <em>ArsTechnica</em> asked about the paper.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/">Apple Security</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/">Encryption</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-silicon-vulnerability-encryption-keys/">Apple Silicon Vulnerability Allows Hackers to Extract Encryption Keys</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-silicon-vulnerability-allows-hackers-to-extract-encryption-keys.2422535/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ipad-purple-prime-day.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916648" /><br/>
According to an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118614">Apple Support document</a>, a bug in iOS 17.4 impacted the camera on the 6th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, 7th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, 10.5-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and second-generation 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, preventing camera apps from being able to scan QR codes. Apple says that customers affected by this issue should update to iPadOS 17.4.1 to fix the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to iPadOS 17.4.1, Apple was suggesting that &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; users unable to scan QR codes with the Camera app and other third-party apps use the Code Scanner function in the Control Center.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's release notes did not mention the bug fix, perhaps due to the limited number of &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models that are impacted. iPadOS 17.4.1 also added other unspecified bug fixes and security improvements.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/ios-17-4-1-qr-code-scanning-bug/">iPadOS 17.4.1 Fixes QR Code Scanning Bug</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-17-4-1-fixes-qr-code-scanning-bug.2422469/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of Justice today <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-apple-monopolizing-smartphone-markets">announced</a> it has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1344546/dl?inline">filed an antitrust lawsuit</a> against Apple. The lawsuit alleges that Apple illegally maintains a monopoly in the smartphone market with the iPhone and the device's locked-down ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbpkMKZUuxU" title="Apple is Being Sued by U.S. Department of Justice!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
In a statement shared with <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple said the lawsuit is "wrong on the facts and the law," and the company vowed to "vigorously defend" itself:<blockquote>At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love—designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people's privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users. This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people's technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.</blockquote>The complaint was filed today in a U.S. District Court in New Jersey by the Justice Department and 16 other U.S. state and district attorneys general. Apple is accused of violating various U.S. federal and state antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act.<br/>
<br/>
In its press release, the Justice Department highlighted some of the allegations:<blockquote>- <strong>Blocking Innovative Super Apps</strong>. Apple has disrupted the growth of apps with broad functionality that would make it easier for consumers to switch between competing smartphone platforms.<br/>
- <strong>Suppressing Mobile Cloud Streaming Services.</strong> Apple has blocked the development of cloud-streaming apps and services that would allow consumers to enjoy high-quality video games and other cloud-based applications without having to pay for expensive smartphone hardware.<br/>
- <strong>Excluding Cross-Platform Messaging Apps.</strong> Apple has made the quality of cross-platform messaging worse, less innovative, and less secure for users so that its customers have to keep buying iPhones.<br/>
- <strong>Diminishing the Functionality of Non-Apple Smartwatches.</strong> Apple has limited the functionality of third-party smartwatches so that users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones.<br/>
- <strong>Limiting Third Party Digital Wallets.</strong> Apple has prevented third-party apps from offering tap-to-pay functionality, inhibiting the creation of cross-platform third-party digital wallets.</blockquote>Apple's anticompetitive conduct also affects "web browsers, video communication, news subscriptions, entertainment, automotive services, advertising, location services, and more," according to the Justice Department.<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan Kanter, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division:<blockquote>For years, Apple responded to competitive threats by imposing a series of "Whac-A-Mole" contractual rules and restrictions that have allowed Apple to extract higher prices from consumers, impose higher fees on developers and creators, and to throttle competitive alternatives from rival technologies. Today's lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets.</blockquote>The entire complaint spans <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1344546/dl?inline">88 pages</a>, so there is a lot of information to unpack. Stay tuned for more coverage throughout the day.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-sued-by-us-department-of-justice/">Apple Sued by U.S. Department of Justice, Says Lawsuit is &#039;Wrong&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sued-by-u-s-department-of-justice-says-lawsuit-is-wrong.2422451/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
