		<description><![CDATA[Following this past weekend's sighting of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/">NBA superstar LeBron James carrying an unreleased Beats speaker</a> reminiscent of the former Beats Pill, F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo has also been seen <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6eY884oXAH/">teasing the unreleased speaker</a> at this week's Grand Prix stop in Miami.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/beats-pill-f1-daniel-ricciardo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949043" /><br/>
Details on the unreleased speaker remain unknown, but it features a similar pill-shaped design to the rest of the Pill family and includes a lanyard that has not been present on previous models. The most recent model in the Pill family was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/beats-pill-discontinued/">discontinued in 2022</a>, and this new one will likely include a USB-C port, updated Bluetooth specs, and other improvements.<br/>
<br/>
Beats has yet to officially announce the upcoming Beats Pill, so a release date similarly remains unknown.<br/>
<br/>
The Beats Pill teases come as part of a busy week for Apple's speaker and headphone brand, as Beats this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-4-launch/">introduced the Solo 4 on-ear headphones</a> and announced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">all-new Solo Buds earphones</a> that will be launching in June.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[At some point in the last 24 hours, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> seems to have forgotten how to relay the time. When asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; "what time is it?" &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is unable to answer and directs users to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-and-Mini-feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-882635" /><br/>
"I found some web results, I can show them if you ask again from your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;," is &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s full response to the time question. If you ask what time it is in a specific location, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is able to respond, and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac provides the time as usual when asked.<br/>
<br/>
This is a bug that Apple will be able to fix server side, so it will likely be addressed quickly. In the meantime, to get the time from &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; without having to swap to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, include your location.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has long been ridiculed for failing to understand requests and not providing the expected information, and small bugs like this are a bit embarrassing as Apple prepares for a major AI update.<br/>
<br/>
For the last several months, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has also been struggling with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> commands, and there have been many complaints from smart home users. Asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to "turn off the lights in the living room," for example, often results in the lights being turned on or turned off in another room entirely. Hopefully some of these issues will be solved with a &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; overhaul in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and its sister updates.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> Apple seems to have fixed the issue somewhat. Asking "what time is it?" provides the time, but &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is still not able to give the time if you ask "what's the time?" or "can you tell me the time?"<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today confirmed that it will be bringing all of the app ecosystem changes made to iOS in the European Union to iPadOS in the fall. Earlier this week, the European Commission said that iPadOS is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/eu-says-ipados-digital-gatekeeper-dma/">also a gatekeeper platform</a> under the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/ipad-pro-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940265" /><br/>
EU developers will be able to distribute <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> using alternative app marketplaces or websites, and all of the same terms will apply. The Core Technology Fee will be charged for apps that are distributed outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and have more than one million first annual installs, though there are exceptions for small developers, which Apple also announced today.<br/>
<br/>
With iPadOS being added to the mix, Apple has also confirmed that users who install the same app on both iOS and iPadOS in a 12-month period will only generate one first annual install for that app rather than two, which should help developers keep below the CTF threshold.<br/>
<br/>
As with the changes to iOS, the upcoming changes to iPadOS only apply to developers who distribute apps in the European Union and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; users in the EU. For the rest of the world, there are no changes and apps will continue to be available only from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/ipados-eu-app-changes-fall/">Apple Confirms iPadOS Will Get Same EU App Changes as iOS This Fall</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-ipados-will-get-same-eu-app-changes-as-ios-this-fall.2425320/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Tweaks EU Core Technology Fee to Avoid Bankrupting Unexpectedly Viral Apps</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that it is tweaking the terms of the 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee (CTF) that apps distributed using the new EU business terms must pay, introducing a solution that would keep small apps that go viral from being charged unreasonable fees. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
First, independent and small developers who earn no revenue at all will not have to pay the CTF. Students, hobbyists, and freeware app developers who distribute free apps and earn no money will not be charged the fee. Developers will need to declare their non-commercial status on an annual basis, and to maintain this status, developers must have no revenue in or out of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for their app product.<br/>
<br/>
Second, to address fears of the CTF causing outrageous fees for an app that suddenly goes viral, Apple has implemented a three year on-ramping process for small developers. The three year period begins when a developer agrees to the new &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; business terms, and during this time, if an app goes viral and exceeds the one million annual install threshold that triggers the CTF, the CTF won't be charged if the developer earns less than 10 million euros in global business revenue, and the fee is reduced after that.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Under 10 million euros: No CTF during the three year period.</li><br/>
 	<li>Between 10 million and 50 million euros: CTF must be paid, but it is capped at one million euros per year for the three year period.</li><br/>
 	<li>Beyond 50 million euros: Benefit is no longer available, and the full CTF has to be paid.</li><br/>
<li>After three years: Developers will pay for each first annual install after the initial one million first annual installs per year.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Note that this ramp up period is only available to small developers who have not previously exceeded one million first annual installs, and it is calculated based on global business revenue rather than just &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; revenue. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says that 99 percent of developers will not be subject to the CTF to begin with, but the new ramp up period will go further to make sure that small developers who get a breakout hit will have time to scale their businesses before having to pay fees.<br/>
<br/>
Back in March, developer Riley Testut spoke with Apple officials at a workshop on the Digital Markets Act, and he asked what would happen if a young developer had an app go viral and unwittingly racked up millions in fees. Testut asked the question because when he was a high school student, he released GBA4iOS outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. It was unexpectedly downloaded more than 10 million times, and that would have bankrupted him had he been subject to the Core Technology Fee.<br/>
<br/>
In response, Apple VP of regulatory law Kyle Andeers said that Apple was working on a solution because the company is not trying to stifle innovation. Apple believes that a free app going viral and being subject to exorbitant fees will be a rare occurrence, but the changes will keep that from happening. The CTF update will also be a welcome change for those who want to release entirely free apps outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The CTF is only applicable to apps that have opted in to the new &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; business terms in the European Union. Apps in the EU are now able to be distributed through alternative app stores and developer websites without having to rely on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models were its most purchased smartphones in the U.S. in the first quarter of this year, according to the latest <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/iphone-15-winners-and-losers">Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) report</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/iPhone-14-vs-iPhone-15-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-863031" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max accounted for 22% and 23% of all iPhones sold in Q1 2024, for a 45% combined share. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Plus took a 9% share of all iPhones sold, while the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> were the third most popular, each taking 14% of the share. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max share hardly changed compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and Pro Max the same quarter a year ago. However, Apple saw sales of the base model &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; decline relative to a year ago. The overall mix of &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models was lower, accounting for 68% of all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales. <br/>
<br/>
By contrast, in Q1 2023 the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; series had a 7% higher share of all iPhones sold, taking 75% combined. The percentages suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus were more popular than the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus over the equivalent quarter the previous year. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CIRP-iphone-14-15-quarters-compared.jpg" alt="" width="1127" height="827" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948990" /><br/>
Noting the change, CIRP comments:<br/>
<blockquote>We see this as a continuation of a trend from the past couple of quarters, as the lower- priced current models give up some share to older models. The once flagship, now base iPhone 15, is no longer the leading-edge choice, as the Pro and Pro Max models take that role.</blockquote>Last week, CIRP released a report indicating that new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; activations are down to a low not seen in the U.S. smartphone market <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/25/iphone-activation-market-share-decline/">for the last six years</a>. <br/>
<br/>
CIRP said that Apple's installed smartphone base was higher than recorded activations, but Apple's share of new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; activations fell from 40% to 33% over the past year, suggesting a shift away from the higher market shares Apple enjoyed in previous years.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/">CIRP</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/cirp-iphone-15-vs-14-sales-q1/">iPhone 15 and 15 Plus Proving Less Popular With Buyers This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-and-15-plus-proving-less-popular-with-buyers-this-year.2425315/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When Apple released iOS 17.3 in January, it introduced a Stolen Device Protection feature to provide iPhone users with added security. This article explains what it does, why you might want to turn it on, and how to go about doing so.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926120" /><br/>
In 2023, reports began emerging about a new method thieves were using to steal iPhones and access users' highly sensitive data. Thieves would surreptitiously spy on their victims in public while they entered their passcode, before going on to steal the device. With the passcode known to them, criminals could empty bank accounts, steal passwords, and make the iPhone untraceable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Enter, Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
To make it harder for a thief to access passcode-protected data on a stolen iPhone, Apple in iOS 17.3 included Stolen Device Protection. With the feature enabled, Face ID or Touch ID is required to access passwords in iCloud Keychain, Lost Mode settings, options for erasing the device, and making purchases in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the new biometric requirements, the feature also imposes a one-hour security delay on actions like changing an Apple ID password. In other words, if someone tries to change Apple ID login information, Face ID authentication is required, and then an hour must pass before the password can be changed. The only time this wait period is not imposed is when the device at a trusted location like home or work.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Actions Requiring Face ID/Touch ID With Stolen Device Protection Enabled</h2><br/>
 <ul><br/>
 <li>Viewing/using passwords or passkeys saved in iCloud Keychain</li><br/>
 <li>Applying for a new Apple Card</li><br/>
 <li>Viewing an Apple Card virtual card</li><br/>
 <li>Turning off Lost Mode</li><br/>
 <li>Erasing all content and settings</li><br/>
 <li>Taking certain Apple Cash and Savings actions in Wallet</li><br/>
 <li>Using payment methods saved in Safari</li><br/>
 <li>Using your iPhone to set up a new device</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Note that these actions do not have a passcode backup, so you can't use a passcode to avoid using Face ID or Touch ID. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Actions Requiring 1-Hour Delay With Stolen Device Protection Enabled</h2><br/>
Actions that require biometric authentication and have a one-hour security delay include the following:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Changing your Apple ID password</li><br/>
 <li>Updating select Apple ID account security settings, including adding or removing a trusted device, trusted phone number, Recovery Key, or Recovery Contact</li><br/>
 <li>Changing your iPhone passcode</li><br/>
 <li>Adding or removing Face ID or Touch ID</li><br/>
 <li>Turning off Find My</li><br/>
 <li>Turning off Stolen Device Protection</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>How to Enable Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
Note that Stolen Device Protection is only available on iPhones that are able to run iOS 17, which includes the iPhone XS and newer. Also, make sure your iPhone is up-to-date and running iOS 17.3 or later (Settings ➝ General ➝ Software Update). Here's how to enable the feature.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Face ID & Passcode</strong> (or <strong>Touch ID & Passcode</strong>, depending on iPhone model).</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[AI safety and research company Anthropic has <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/team-plan-and-ios">announced</a> the launch of its Claude iOS app, offering users easier access to the conversational agent from their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/claude-ios-app.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948971" /><br/>
Similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, the Claude chatbot operates by processing large amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like responses. Its architecture is based on machine learning techniques including large language models (LLMs). <br/>
<br/>
Whereas ChatGPT is foremost designed for versatility and scalability, Anthropic says its focus is on creating a "steerable" AI so that users can direct the model's style and content more effectively, thereby mitigating potential harmful outputs and biases from the outset.<br/>
<br/>
The AI company says its Claude iOS app features:<br/>
<blockquote><ul><li>Seamless syncing with web chats: Pick up where you left off across devices.</li><br/>
<li>Vision capabilities: Use photos from your library, take new photos, or upload files so you can have real-time image analysis, contextual understanding, and mobile-centric use cases on the go.</li><br/>
<li>Open access: Users across all plans, including Pro and Team, can download the app free of charge.</li></ul></blockquote>According to Anthropic, early testers report that the Claude app is exceptional for brainstorming ideas on the go, getting quick answers to questions, or analyzing scenes and images from the real world. <br/>
<br/>
In March, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family">announced</a> that its Claude 3 language model surpassed ChatGPT and Google's Gemini in various critical industry benchmarks. According to the company, Claude 3 excelled in areas including graduate-level reasoning and multilingual math and coding, among other metrics. <br/>
<br/>
Anthropic also highlighted that their most advanced version of Claude 3, named Opus, demonstrated capabilities close to human level, particularly in delivering quick responses, making it well-suited for complex and urgent tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Claude for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> is a free download available from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/claude/id6473753684">Direct Link</a>] Users can get 5x more Claude usage than its free plan allows and access Anthropic's most powerful model (Claude 3 Opus) by upgrading to a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude">paid Pro plan</a>, which is &#36;20 per month.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/claude-ai-iphone-app-launch-anthropic/">Anthropic Announces Claude AI Chatbot App for iPhone and iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anthropic-announces-claude-ai-chatbot-app-for-iphone-and-ipad.2425307/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's atrial fibrillation (AFib) history feature on Apple Watch has been <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFDA/bulletins/399d551">qualified</a> by the FDA under its Medical Device Development Tools (MDDT) program, the first digital health technology feature of its kind to do so.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/watchos-9-afib-history.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-849842" /><br/>
Since 2022, Apple Watch has supported AFib History, which allows users diagnosed with atrial fibrillation to view an estimate of how frequently their heart is in this type of irregular rhythm. <br/>
<br/>
The feature analyzes pulse rate data collected by a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor to identify episodes consistent with AFib and provides the user with a retrospective estimate of AFib burden (a measure of the amount of time spent in AFib during past Apple Watch wear). Apple says the feature is intended for individuals aged 22 years or older who have been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.<br/>
<br/>
The AFib History feature received FDA clearance in the United States just prior to its announcement by Apple, after being validated in a clinical study. The MDDT program under which the feature was <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/178230/download?attachment">approved</a> today is the FDA's method of qualifying tools that medical device sponsors can choose to use in the development and evaluation of medical devices.  <br/>
<br/>
According to the FDA, the Atrial Fibrillation History feature is:<br/>
<ul><li>The first digital health technology qualified under the MDDT program, providing a non-invasive way to check estimates of atrial fibrillation (AFib) burden within clinical studies.</li><br/>
<li>Designed to be used as a biomarker test to help evaluate estimates of AFib burden as a secondary effectiveness endpoint within clinical studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of cardiac ablation devices to treat.</li><br/>
<li>Designed to be used throughout the clinical study, both before and after cardiac ablation devices, to monitor a study participant’s weekly estimate of AFib burden.</li></ul><em>(Via <a href="https://www.myhealthyapple.com/fda-qualifies-afib-history-mddt/">MyHealthyApple.com</a>.)</em><div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fda/">FDA</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/apple-watch-afib-history-evaluate-medical-devices/">Apple Watch AFib History Feature Qualified by FDA to Evaluate Medical Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-afib-history-feature-qualified-by-fda-to-evaluate-medical-devices.2425302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google paid Apple &#36;20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine for Safari on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/google-s-payments-to-apple-reached-20-billion-in-2022-cue-says">Bloomberg</a></em>. The information was revealed in court documents Google provided in its antitrust dispute with the United States Department of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916340" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/safari-google-search.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" /><br/>
The DoJ has accused Google of having a monopoly on search, and in the lawsuit against Google, the search engine deal with Apple has been a major focus. In November, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-google-safari-search-revenue/">lawsuit documents indicated</a> that Google was paying 36 percent of the total revenue that it earns from searches conducted on Safari, and now it turns out that equates to &#36;20 billion.<br/>
<br/>
Google has been the default search engine on Apple devices since 2002, though the deal has been renegotiated several times. Apple and Google have worked to keep the terms of the search engine agreement under wraps during the trial and before, but it has been well known that Google is paying Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/google-pays-apple-billions-default-search/">billions per year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Last October, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that the agreement between Apple and Google has made it impossible for search engines like Bing to compete. Microsoft at one point wanted Apple to buy Bing, but Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/">was not interested</a>. Microsoft blamed Google, but Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> said that Apple was concerned that Bing could not compete in "quality and capabilities." Cue claimed that Apple uses Google as the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s default search engine because Apple has "always thought it was the best."<br/>
<br/>
Google is the default search engine on Apple devices in most countries, but users can opt to swap to Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Ecosia as alternatives. Changing browser engines requires opening up the Safari settings.<br/>
<br/>
In Europe, the Digital Markets Act has required Apple to make changes to how browsers work. Users are able to choose a default browser when setting up their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and there are more options than the handful of providers that Apple allows in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
If Google loses the antitrust lawsuit against it, the deal between Apple and Google could be dissolved. Closing arguments are expected on Thursday and Friday, with the judge's ruling set to come later in 2024.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/">Safari</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/google-default-search-engine-safari-20-billion/">Google Paid Apple &#36;20 Billion in 2022 to Be Default Safari Search Engine</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-paid-apple-20-billion-in-2022-to-be-default-safari-search-engine.2425289/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Check Out This Apple Watch iPad Demo Unit From 2014</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With the 10th anniversary of the Apple Watch approaching, we thought it would be fun to take a look back at an interesting bit of Apple Watch history.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ipad-demo-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1337" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948938" /><br/>
After the Apple Watch was announced in 2014, and before it became available in 2015, Apple sent out custom Apple Watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> demo kiosks to retail stores. The Apple Watch and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; units used for these devices were specially designed, had custom software, and represent the first and only time that an Apple Watch was able to pair with an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT">AppleDemoYT</a>, known for sourcing rare prototypes, shared images and detailed information about the demo units with <em>MacRumors</em>, offering up detailed insight on the lengths Apple went to for this custom experience. AppleDemoYT was able to acquire one of these now-rare demo units.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ipad-demo-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948939" /><br/>
Jony Ive and his design team came up with the Apple Watch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Kiosks as a way for customers to try out an Apple Watch without needing help from an employee. Apple used a modified <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> 2 running iOS 8.2 paired with an original Apple Watch running watchOS 1.0, with the two devices fused in a custom housing.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Apple used had multiple components removed, including the camera, microphone, and speakers, and the housing of the setup served as the body of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The Apple Watch was heavily modified as well, featuring a groove along the diagnostic port for cable routing, holes to affix it to the demo unit, and a special Sport Band that was shorter than normal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ipad-demo-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948940" /><br/>
The Apple Watch was paired to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; using a wired connection. A lightning cable attached to the Apple Watch diagnostic port connected to a converter board inside the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, allowing the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to communicate with and charge the Apple Watch. A special app called Apple Watch Demo was used to allow the Apple Watch to interface with the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and a connection to Apple's server was required.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ipad-demo-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948941" /><br/>
The server that Apple used for the Apple Watch Demo app has long since gone offline, so the only way to see how the setup worked is through a demo unit that was paired in 2014 and not reset since then. With a functional unit, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is able to mirror the Apple Watch, offering up transition animations and providing tips on the actions that can be performed on the Apple Watch. This functionality is demoed in AppleDemoYT's video:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Apple Watch Demo (2014) - Interactive Demonstration - The Forgotten Apple Device - Apple Demo" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vidGNxCuIA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The custom &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; was not only the sole model able to connect with an Apple Watch, it was also the only &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that could be charged using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> 2, originally designed for the Mac. A &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; connector charged the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, Apple Watch, and extra batteries inside the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. A Lightning port is available as well, but Apple's documentation suggests that it is only meant to be used for data transfer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple discontinued the demo unit in 2016 because it was riddled with issues. Updates to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or Apple Watch would erase demo content, and the front glass was prone to cracking because of the design of the housing. Batteries degraded quickly due to the always-on charging, and overheating and failure were continual problems. Apple also had to deal with pairing and syncing issues, and that caused Apple to tweak the interactive part of the demo functionality in 2015. After that change, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; provided Apple Watch info, but no longer mirrored the content on the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ipad-demo-5.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948942" /><br/>
Demo units that were decommissioned were supposed to be destroyed, and so finding one that is still available, functional, and in good working condition is unusual. The Apple Watch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; kiosk represents one of the most advanced custom devices that Apple had designed at the time, and it offers a neat look back at the Apple Watch's debut.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple has plans for the 10th anniversary of the Apple Watch, and as soon as this year, we may see a redesigned "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">Apple Watch X</a>" with an updated magnetic band attachment system, new health features, and more.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/apple-watch-ipad-demo-unit/">Check Out This Apple Watch iPad Demo Unit From 2014</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/check-out-this-apple-watch-ipad-demo-unit-from-2014.2425283/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 18, the Calendar app on the iPhone will feature integration with the Reminders app, according to information obtained <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/01/apples-ios-18-to-streamline-task-management-with-unified-events-and-reminders">by <em>AppleInsider</em></a>.<br/>

The report claims that iPhone users will be able to schedule and organize reminders directly within the Calendars app, without needing to open the Reminders app. Reminders are expected to be visible within the Day, Week, and Month calendar views.<br/>
<br/>
The change will extend to the Mac with macOS 15, the report says.<br/>
<br/>
The same publication recently reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/ios-18-notes-app-voice-memos-math-rumors/">Calculator and Notes app will also be integrated</a> on iOS 18, and said that the update will include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">new Safari features such as "Intelligent Search" and "Web Eraser."</a> We recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-18-rumor-recap-for-apps/">recapped iOS 18 rumors on a per-app basis</a>, with new features also expected for Apple Music, Messages, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models have been expected to feature the M3 chip for over a year, recent reports have unexpectedly suggested that the new devices will instead feature the as-yet-unannounced M4 chip. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUBArI37GvI" title="New iPad Pro with M4 LEAKED! AI-Focused iPad Coming Next Week?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Last week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that he now believes there is a "strong possibility" that the upcoming &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">equipped with Apple's next-generation M4 chip</a>, rather than the M3 chip that debuted in the MacBook Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> six months ago. He said a key new feature of the M4 chip will be an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">upgraded Neural Engine</a> that boosts performance for AI tasks, and he believes Apple will market the next &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; as an AI-powered device.<br/>
<br/>
Introducing the M4 chip in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and only six months after the previous chip generation would be unprecedented moves. Yet this is not the first time that the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models have been rumored to feature the M4 chip. In March, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/chip-details-of-16-upcoming-apple-devices-revealed/">chip details of 16 new Apple devices</a> were revealed by a source with a proven track record of sharing accurate information about Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>
The disclosed technical information contained four identifiers for an unreleased chip that relates to the upcoming 11- and 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models display sizes. This sequence of identifiers suggested that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will contain the M4 chip, rather than the M3. With Gurman now supporting this possibility and the potential of an AI focus, it seems like an increasingly likely eventuality.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple does introduce the M4 chip in the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, its Apple silicon roadmap would appear to be moving faster than expected. It is possible that TSMC's N3E production volume remains low, making it more suitable for a device like the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; rather than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or Mac at this point in time. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models at its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">"Let Loose" event on May 7</a>. Do you think the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will contain the M4 chip and why?

		<description><![CDATA[MacRumors is pleased to announce our <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2425233/">Fifteenth Annual MacRumors Blood Drive</a>, throughout the month of May 2024. Let's save lives together by encouraging donations of blood, platelets, and plasma. While most blood drives are specific to a geographic location, our blood drive is online and worldwide. Anyone can participate.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/blood_drive_2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="672" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948801" /><br/>
Over the past 14 years, MacRumors Blood Drives have recorded donations of <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/posts/32205640/">1,305 units of blood, platelets, and plasma</a>, cheered for donors, and celebrated new signups for the organ donor and bone marrow registries. We've heard from hundreds of forum members who donate or whose lives were saved by the donations of strangers.<br/>
<br/>
This year's featured donor is user Neil.gtis, a three-year forum member from England. Neil is a regular donor who has made 98 blood donations to date, and will reach his 100th donation this year. Whether you're a regular donor like Neil.gtis or someone overcoming apprehension to donate for the very first time, we congratulate you.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>How to participate in the MacRumors Blood Drive</h3><br/>
<ol><li>If you are an eligible donor (e.g., <a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/eligibility-requirements.html">U.S. eligibility rules</a>), schedule a blood, platelet, or plasma donation (<a href="https://macrumors.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201729417-Blood-and-Platelet-Donation-">FAQ</a>) at any donation center near you. Post in the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2425233/">MacRumors 2024 Blood Drive!</a> thread to tell us about it. Also post if you register as an organ donor or register for the bone marrow registry (<a href="https://macrumors.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201771053-Organ-Tissue-and-Bone-Marrow-Donation">FAQ</a>). We'll add all donors and registrants to our <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/posts/33101529/">Honor Roll</a>.</li><br/>
<li>If you aren't eligible to donate, such as for medical reasons, please encourage someone else to make a donation, and let us know. If they donate, you'll both be added to our <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/posts/33101529/">Honor Roll</a>. The FDA has changed the U.S. donor eligibility rules, by removing the blanket ban on MSM donors, so there are more eligible donors than ever before.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXCXKPD%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. This is just &#36;10 higher compared to the all-time low price on the wearable, and it's available in the Silver, Midnight, and Starlight Aluminum Case options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-se-gen-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-865510" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
You can also get the 44mm GPS Apple Watch SE on sale right now, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWYCT6C%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;219.00</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;279.00. This is another near all-time low price that's just &#36;10 away from the lowest price on the Apple Watch SE, and it's available in Midnight and Starlight Aluminum options.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXCXKPD%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;60 OFF</div>Apple Watch SE (40mm GPS) for &#36;189.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Additionally, both cellular models have hit record low prices this week on Amazon. The 40mm cellular Apple Watch SE is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7PF7V%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;239.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;299.00, and the 44mm cellular model is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXB1D3Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;269.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;329.00. You can find these all-time low prices available in multiple colors right now on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
This model of the Apple Watch SE launched in September 2022 and remains Apple's most affordable Apple Watch. The Apple Watch SE lacks some of the upgraded features you'll find in some Series 9 or Ultra 2 models, like temperature sensing and ECG functionality, but it will otherwise provide you with all key Apple Watch features, and at the cheapest price possible.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[LG has updated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> app to support Dolby Atmos, making it the first smart TV manufacturer to do so (via <em><a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1714539123">FlatpanelsHD</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/apple-music-lg-tv.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-826014" /><br/>
The change allows users to experience immersive audio that enhances the spatial perception of sound, previously achievable only with external hardware. The feature was confirmed to be operational on the LG GX OLED TV from the 2020 lineup, with expectations that it will work on all LG TVs that are compatible with Dolby Atmos from 2020 onwards.<br/>
<br/>
While the TV's built-in speakers can utilize this new capability, LG suggests that the best audio experience is achieved with a compatible surround sound system, which can take advantage of the Dolby Atmos technology more effectively.<br/>
<br/>
The update to the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app on LG TVs circumvents the necessity for additional Apple hardware. Before this update, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s Dolby Atmos support was available on TVs singularly through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K, paired with either Apple's HomePods or Sonos speakers connected through the Sonos app. Other smart TV manufacturers are likely to follow suit and add support for Dolby Atmos in their own &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; apps. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg/">LG</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dolby-atmos/">Dolby Atmos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/lg-tv-support-for-apple-music-dolby-atmos/">LG TVs Gain Support for Dolby Atmos With Apple Music</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lg-tvs-gain-support-for-dolby-atmos-with-apple-music.2425255/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did you know it's possible to take multiple Live Photos from your iPhone's photo library and turn them into a single continuous video? Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg" alt="" width="836" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897381" /><br/>
On iPhone and iPad, Live Photos bring your pictures to life by adding a few seconds of video before and after the shot, creating a living memory rather than a static image. <br/>
<br/>
While Live Photos are great on their own, it's also possible to weave several together to create a video montage. This process transforms a collection of moments into a cohesive narrative, and offers an easier way to share and relive your memories. <br/>
<br/>
Whether it's a series of shots from a special event, a day out with friends, or a compilation of everyday moments, the following steps show you how to turn several Live Photos into a video that can encapsulate their essence in a way that a single photo or traditional video might not.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>In the Photos app, tap the <strong>Albums</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</li><br/>
  <li>Scroll down to "Media Types," and tap <strong>Live Photos</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Select</strong> in the top-right corner, then tap the Live Photos you want to include in your video so that a little checkmark appears on each one.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap the circle icon containing three dots in the bottom-right corner.</li><br/>
  <li>Choose <strong>Save as Video</strong> in the pop-up menu.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/turn-live-photos-into-video.jpg" alt="photos" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942186" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. To watch your newly created video, return to the <strong>Albums</strong> view and select <strong>Videos</strong> under the "Media Types" section. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Just over six months ago, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the likelihood of a new Apple Watch Ultra being released in 2024 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/kuo-apple-watch-ultra-3-in-2024-odds-decreasing/">was "decreasing,"</a> but it now sounds like there will be an Apple Watch Ultra 3 this year after all.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-hero-feature-blorange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911679" /><br/>
In a direct message shared with <em>MacRumors</em> today, Kuo said that while the Apple Watch Ultra will be updated this year, the new model will have "almost no" hardware upgrades compared to the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Kuo did not reveal any specific changes planned for the Apple Watch Ultra 3, which will presumably launch in September.<br/>
<br/>
A third-generation Apple Watch SE is also a possibility this year if Apple sticks to a two-year upgrade cycle for that model, but the successor to the Apple Watch Series 9 is not entirely clear. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously reported about a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">redesigned "Apple Watch X"</a> with a thinner case and magnetic bands, but he said it would be released "in 2024 or 2025," so it is not clear if it will launch this year or next year.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, Gurman previously said the model that succeeds the Apple Watch Series 9 will offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/2024-apple-watch-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea/">blood pressure sensing and sleep apnea detection</a>, and these features would almost certainly extend to the Apple Watch Ultra 3.<br/>
<br/>
The original Apple Watch was unveiled in September 2014, and launched in April 2015, so the device is approaching its tenth anniversary.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/kuo-on-apple-watch-ultra-3-hardware/">Kuo: Apple Watch Ultra to Get &#039;Almost No&#039; Hardware Upgrades This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-watch-ultra-to-get-almost-no-hardware-upgrades-this-year.2425251/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An in-depth <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-01/will-gm-regret-kicking-apple-carplay-off-the-dashboard"><em>Bloomberg</em> report</a> today resurfaced General Motors' decision to replace Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> with its own software.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-CarPlay-Dash.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-934995" /><br/>
Last year, GM <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/">announced</a> that it planned to forgo Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; in its new electric vehicles, starting with the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV. Instead, the automaker introduced a proprietary infotainment platform, aiming to control and customize the digital experience within its vehicles. This transition is part of GM's strategic pivot toward enhancing its software capabilities and establishing a stronger digital services revenue stream. However, the change has not been without its hurdles, with numerous customers and automotive reviewers reporting technical issues and a steep learning curve associated with the new system.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; has become a staple of most new vehicles, offering drivers a familiar interface that mirrors their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s functionality onto the vehicle's dashboard. Apple reported in 2022 that 79% of car buyers in the U.S. insisted on &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; support when considering a new vehicle purchase. <br/>
<br/>
GM's new in-house system, Ultifi, is envisioned as a comprehensive digital platform that offers a range of services such as navigation and media streaming, enhanced by subscription-based add-ons to drive revenue. Despite these aspirations, the rollout of Ultifi has encountered significant obstacles such as software malfunctions that dealerships have struggled to resolve. <br/>
<br/>
GM's move is driven by a wish to reclaim customer connections and data insights from third parties, but customer resistance to abandoning a familiar and popular system like &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; that directly integrates with their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; poses a significant challenge to GM's strategy.<br/>
<br/>
The outcome of GM's decision could influence future industry practices significantly. If GM can refine Ultifi into a robust, user-friendly platform that rivals or surpasses &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;'s functionality, it may set a precedent for other automakers to follow suit. Conversely, if consumers continue to prefer established systems like &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, automakers may find themselves in a difficult position, needing to balance their corporate interests with consumer preferences.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[When you go to share something on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, iOS tries to be helpful by displaying a row of suggested contacts at the top of the Share menu. Keep reading to learn how to get rid of them.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/suggested-contacts.jpg" alt="share menu suggestions" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948831" /><br/>
Whenever you go to share something on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> using the Share button, iOS brings up a Share menu – often called the Share Sheet – at the top of which is a row of suggested contacts with whom you've interacted recently. Swiping along this row reveals more contacts, and the icon in the corner of each profile picture indicates the app that you often use to communicate with that person.<br/>
<br/>
These suggested contacts are useful if you share a lot of things with the same people, but there may be times when you'd prefer not to see specific contacts there, for example if someone is a duplicate suggestion over multiple apps, or if you don't want to draw attention to your regular comms with a certain someone. Whatever the reason, you can actually steer these sharing suggestions to appear less often, or not at all. Here's how.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Make Contacts Appear Less Often in the Share Menu</h2><ol><li>Tap the <strong>Share button</strong> (the box with an arrow pointing out) in any app to bring up the Share Sheet.</li><br/>
<li>Long press on the suggested contact that you want to see less often in the Share menu.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Suggest Less</strong> in the popover menu.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/1suggested-contacts-.jpg" alt="share menu" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948829" /><br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind, doing this won't guarantee that the contact doesn't appear in the Share Sheet again in future, but if you keep repeating it whenever they do show up, iOS will eventually get the message.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Remove All Contacts From iPhone Share Menu</h2><br/>
Short of deleting their contact in the Contacts app, the only way to guarantee that someone doesn't keep turning up on your Share Sheet is to disable the contact suggestions row completely.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Siri & Search</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Under the "Suggestions From Apple" section, toggle off the switch next to <strong>Show When Sharing</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/2suggested-contacts-.jpg" alt="settings" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948830" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. Now the next time you invoke the Share Sheet, you won't see any contact profiles at the top. You can reverse the change just as easily by switching on the <strong>Show When Sharing</strong> toggle again.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/remove-suggested-contacts-iphone-share-menu/">Remove Suggested Contacts From Your iPhone&#039;s Share Menu</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/remove-suggested-contacts-from-your-iphones-share-menu.2425242/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
