		<description><![CDATA[Spotify CEO Daniel Ek is urging lawmakers in the United Kingdom to adopt a bill that would regulate competition in digital markets, cutting down on the dominance of Apple, Google, and other large tech companies.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-vs-Spotify-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801789" /><br/>
The <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453">Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Bill</a> (DMCC) that the UK is developing would allow competition authorities to impose conduct requirements on companies and "promote competition" when a company's policies are "having an adverse effect on competition." Ek has long advocated for legislation that hobbles Apple's ability to both offer a platform (iOS) and compete on that platform with apps like Spotify rival <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f0138fee-5375-47b2-a717-a1eaf8038512">Financial Times</a></em>, Ek said that Apple and Google's control over how billions of consumers access the internet is "insane."<br/>
<br/>
"Not only are they dictating the rules, they also compete directly downstream with those providers," said Ek. Ek wants the UK bill to make sure that a company that's the referee in the digital market "can't also be the player." The DMCC needs to have "real teeth" he said, adding that the bill is for all developers. "More and more of these developers are now finding that Apple is a competitor," he said.<br/>
<br/>
If passed, the DMCC would give the UK's Competition and Markets Authority the power to impose multibillion-pound fines for large companies that breach the established rules. Tech companies would be required to provide more transparency about how their app stores work, with regulators able to open up specific markets like app stores or search engines.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify has been in a feud with Apple for years, with the dispute between the two companies most recently heating up in 2022 when Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/spotify-audio-book-app-update-rejected-apple/">rejected a Spotify app update</a> that added audiobook support. Spotify back in 2019 filed a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/">regulatory complaint</a> in the European Union over Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> practices, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/apple-responds-to-eu-narrowing-antitrust-case/">still under investigation</a>, and the company has also backed the Open Markets Act in the United States, legislation that would require Apple to allow for sideloading and alternate app stores.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/spotify-apple-uk-legislation/">Spotify CEO on Apple and Google: &#039;If You Want to Be the Referee, You Can&#039;t Also Be the Player&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-ceo-on-apple-and-google-if-you-want-to-be-the-referee-you-cant-also-be-the-player.2406014/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Deal Responsible for Google&#039;s Dominance in Search, Says Microsoft CEO</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella today said that he believes the search engine deal between Apple and Google has made it impossible for other search engines like Bing to compete (via <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-limits-of-ai-at-google-antitrust-trial-32d032a9">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>). With Google as the default search engine on Safari on all Apple devices, people become accustomed to using it, Nadella explained in testimony he gave during the ongoing Google vs. U.S. Department of Justice antitrust trial.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/microsoft-bing-chatgpt.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884498" /><br/>
"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you search on Google," said Nadella. "With that level of habit forming, the only way to change is by changing defaults." Nadella went on to say that Google is able to use its ~90 percent market share to improve search results, further reinforcing its monopoly. He said that it's "bogus" that there is choice in the search engine market.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft has been attempting to chip market share away from Google by adding OpenAI's chatbot technology to Bing, but Nadella says it is unclear how much AI can reshape the existing market because Google's distribution advantage doesn't go away. "I worry a lot about that," he said. "Even in spite of my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could become even more vicious because the defaults get reinforced."<br/>
<br/>
Last week, iTunes chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/">testified in the trial</a> and explained that Apple opts for Google as the default search engine on its devices because the company has "always thought it was the best." Google does pay Apple billions of dollars per year to remain the default search engine, though Cue claimed there is no valid alternative.<br/>
<br/>
Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/">Microsoft approached Apple</a> and offered up Bing as a potential acquisition target, but talks between Microsoft execs and &zwnj;Eddy Cue&zwnj; did not progress, both because of the money Apple gets from Google and concerns that Bing would not be able to compete with Google Search.<br/>
<br/>
Nadella is likely correct that it would be difficult at this point for any search engine to truly compete with Google, especially as long as Google remains the default search engine on Apple devices. The exception might be if Apple decides to develop its own search engine at some point.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-01/could-apple-replace-google-with-own-search-engine-it-s-possible-but-unlikely-ln7gywed">Sunday's edition of the Power On newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/19/apple-to-launch-search-engine-to-rival-google/">reiterated rumors</a> that Apple has considered creating its own search engine. Such a solution would be able to provide better privacy and deeper integration with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Spotlight, and Apple has already developed search tools that are used in apps like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea heads up a search team within Apple, and according to Gurman, that team has created a next-generation search engine for Apple apps. Codenamed "Pegasus," the search technology is able to provide more accurate results. While it is already used in some Apple apps, Apple will be expanding it to additional apps, such as the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
What Apple has now does not match the Google search engine, but Gurman argues that Apple could use it as the backbone for a full search engine in the future.<br/>
<br/>
There are still a few more weeks to go in the antitrust trial, and it is not yet clear what the outcome will be. If lawmakers target the lucrative deal between Apple and Google, the billions of dollars that Apple will lose could serve as a catalyst for Apple to further pursue its own search engine option.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bing/">Bing</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-on-apple-goole-search-deal/">Apple Deal Responsible for Google&#039;s Dominance in Search, Says Microsoft CEO</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-deal-responsible-for-googles-dominance-in-search-says-microsoft-ceo.2405987/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All first-generation Apple Watch models released in 2015 were added to Apple's obsolete products list on September 30, according to an internal memo obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. As a result, these outdated "Series 0" watches are no longer eligible for repairs or other service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Provider locations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Watch-Edition-Gold-2015.jpg" alt="" width="2117" height="1191" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915075" /><br/>
The list of obsolete models includes the first-generation Apple Watch Edition with an 18-karat gold casing, which cost up to &#36;17,000 in the U.S. when it was available. The solid-gold Apple Watch was discontinued in 2016 and replaced with a ceramic Apple Watch Edition, which was a more affordable luxury at up to &#36;1,299. On the software side, watchOS 5 dropped compatibility with the solid-gold Apple Watch in 2018.<br/>
<br/>
All other 38mm and 42mm aluminum and stainless steel versions of the original Apple Watch, including Hermès variants, are also now classified as obsolete.<br/>
<br/>
Apple classifies a product as technologically obsolete once more than seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. The original Apple Watch was discontinued in September 2016 upon the release of Apple Watch Series 2 and Series 1 models, so the first-generation models recently crossed that seven-year mark.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet updated its public-facing vintage and obsolete products list to reflect these additions, but that should happen soon.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> could be available with a range of interchangeable tips to emulate different drawing styles, according to a sketchy rumor shared by the X (formerly Twitter) user known as "<a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1708118363631743055?s=20">Majin Bu</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/m2-ipad-pro-apple-pencil-hover.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="596" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-869663" /><br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; will apparently come with different tips for drawing, technical drawing, and painting that connect magnetically. Majin Bu did not share any further details about the device. After a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil-3/">flurry of rumors</a> in 2021, rumors about a third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; model noticeably died down and nothing has been heard about the product until now.<br/>
<br/>
In March 2021, the leaker known as "Mr. White" shared an image purporting to depict a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/">next-generation Apple Pencil prototype</a> that featured a shorter design, glossy finish, and a larger, deeper tip. Apple was believed to have worked on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-working-on-smaller-apple-pencil/">smaller Apple Pencil</a> designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/apple-planned-iphone-apple-pencil/">&#36;49 model for the iPhone</a>, but both products never emerged and are said to have been canceled entirely.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that while Majin Bu often aggregates and shares information related to Apple's plans, they do not have a solid track record. The current &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is the second-generation version introduced alongside the 2018 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, meaning that it is one of the oldest Apple devices still on sale. As such, it is fairly likely that Apple has plans to launch a third-generation model at some point, and the company still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/">files patents</a> on new technologies for the accessory, but the latest rumor should still be taken with a pinch of salt until it is corroborated.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">Apple Pencil 3 Could Feature Magnetic Tips for Different Drawing Styles, Sketchy Rumor Claims</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips-for-different-drawing-styles-sketchy-rumor-claims.2405953/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently started selling refurbished second-generation HomePod models for the first time in select countries, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/FQJ83B/A/Refurbished-HomePod-2nd-Gen-White">including the U.K.</a>, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and others. Availability has yet to expand to the U.S., but the product listing is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FQJ73LL/A/Refurbished-HomePod-2nd-Gen-Midnight">already visible</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-White-and-Midnight-Feature-Blue-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881771" /><br/>
Prices are discounted by approximately 15% compared to a brand new HomePod. In the U.K., for example, a refurbished HomePod costs £249, down from £299. In the U.S., a refurbished HomePod will cost &#36;249, down from &#36;299.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its certified refurbished HomePods undergo full functionality testing, and they are inspected, cleaned, and repackaged in a plain white box with the power cord and documentation. The refurbished HomePods are covered by Apple's limited one-year warranty policy, and they are eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
Released in January 2023, the second-generation HomePod has a similar design as the original HomePod that was discontinued in 2021, but with a larger backlit touch surface, two fewer tweeters, two fewer microphones, and a few other changes.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week stopped providing human technical assistance via direct messages on X, formerly known as Twitter, in a shift away from social media support.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Support-App-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908138" /><br/>
As of October 1, customers who send a direct message to the <a href="https://twitter.com/applesupport">@AppleSupport account on X</a> receive an automated reply with links to the Get Support page on Apple's website, and to the Apple Support app for the iPhone and iPad. The account also appears to have stopped offering human replies to posts tagging the @AppleSupport account, but it still provides some automated replies with links to various pages on Apple's website.<br/>
<br/>
The account's description previously said it was "available every day to answer your questions," but that text was removed this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Support-X.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="364" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914995" /><br/>
The account will continue to share tips, tricks, and helpful information, including videos from the Apple Support channel on YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> was first to report that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/apple-social-media-support-report/">planning to eliminate paid social media support advisor roles</a> across X, YouTube, and the Apple Support Community website. Apple offered affected employees the opportunity to transition to a phone-based support role in the company, according to sources familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
One of the sources said that human support on the Apple Support Community will continue temporarily amid the transition to phone support. Responses to comments on videos uploaded to the Apple Support channel on YouTube appear to have stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Apple had offered human support on Twitter since 2016. Last year, the social media platform was controversially acquired by billionaire Elon Musk, but it's unclear if that was a factor in Apple's move towards automated support on the website.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-support/">Apple Support</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-stops-offering-human-support-on-x/">Apple Support Account on X No Longer Offers Help From a Human</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-support-account-on-x-no-longer-offers-help-from-a-human.2405940/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">MicroLED</a> display technology will be the next major upgrade coming to the Apple Watch Ultra, according to a Weibo leaker with a proven track record for disclosing accurate information about Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>

The account known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Instant Digital</a>" claims that the next worthwhile upgrade for the Apple Watch Ultra users will be Apple's custom microLED display technology, but the feature is not expected to launch next year. The source was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">first to report</a> the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>'s Yellow spring refresh, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/">Spatial Video</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/">minor refresh</a>, as well as the only rumor claiming that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus would feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/">frosted back glass</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's plan to bring a microLED display to the Apple Watch Ultra is very widely corroborated, starting with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/">report</a> from display analyst Ross Young in January. TrendForce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/04/apple-watch-ultra-microled-delayed-early-2026/">claims</a> that Apple's first microLED display will launch on a new Apple Watch Ultra model in 2026, due to supply chain adjustments, but some earlier reports placed the device's launch in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/apple-watch-ultra-second-half-2025/">2025</a>. The microLED display is expected to be 2.12-inches in size, a 10% increase over the display of the current Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/15/apple-custom-displays-heading-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-after-apple-watch/">reported</a> Apple is likely planning to bring custom microLED displays to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac after the technology debuts in a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra. He believes Apple's long-term plan is to bring microLED displays to all of its key products. Other reports from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/10/microled-iphone-report/"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/apple-mass-produce-microled-iphone/"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/"><em>The Information</em></a> have indicated similar plans for Apple to transition to custom microLED displays across multiple product lines in an effort to become less <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/">reliant on Samsung</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is believed to have spent more than six years developing microLED technology for what will become the first display custom-designed by the company itself, mirroring its work on Apple silicon. Apple reportedly kicked off the current form of its microLED project, codenamed T159, around 2017. At an earlier stage, it even wanted to introduce the technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/">with the iPhone X</a>. The advanced display offers improved brightness, color reproduction, and viewing angles, making images look more like they are "painted" atop the display glass, and replace parts currently supplied by companies like Samsung and LG.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/micro-led/">Micro-LED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Setsuna Digital</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/next-major-apple-watch-upgrade-to-be-microled/">Next Major Apple Watch Ultra Upgrade Rumored to Be MicroLED Display Technology</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-major-apple-watch-ultra-upgrade-rumored-to-be-microled-display-technology.2405936/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Ultra display is too difficult to read in low light conditions, report some users, an ambient light sensor issue that is likely linked to Apple's watchOS 10 software update last month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-night-mode.jpg" alt="" width="1598" height="953" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-866222" /><br/>
There are multiple complaints from <em>MacRumors</em> readers (<a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-brightness-issues.2361676/page-4">1</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-2-aod-too-dim.2404865/">2</a>), Reddit users (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16rbcj8/apple_watch_ultra_2_inconsistent_display_issues/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16sfez8/ambient_light_sensor_behavior_is_this_expected/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16tb1g5/new_ultra_2_barely_useable_in_the_dark_while/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16przfx/apple_watch_ultra_2_brightness/">4</a>), and <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255146215?page=7">Apple Community users</a> who say that they are unable to read information on the Apple Watch Ultra display in dark environments because the screen is too dim, suggesting the device's ambient light sensor has not been properly calibrated to increase brightness to an adequate level. <br/>
<br/>
Launched last month, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 pushes the maximum screen brightness to 3,000 nits, making it the brightest Apple Watch ever, according to Apple. The display is also capable of reducing brightness to as low as 1 nits.<br/>
<br/>
Some Ultra 2 owners have pinned the blame on this new hardware specification, however the recent uptick in reports also includes users of the first-generation Apple Watch Ultra, suggesting it is an issue with Apple's watchOS 10 software update, which was released in September.<br/>
<br/>
Users say the issue is particularly pronounced when quickly moving from a bright room to a dark area, and when the Wayfinder and Ultra Modular watch face is set to Night mode, which puts a red filter on the display. Legibility issues persist despite manual adjustments to the brightness level in the watch's Settings. Both Ultra and Ultra 2 owners say the problem is evident on models updated with watchOS 10.0.1 and the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-watchos-10-0-2/">watchOS 10.0.2 update</a>. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-watch-ultra-how-to-activate-night-mode/">Apple Watch Ultra: How to Activate Night Mode</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple is reportedly aware of the issue, so hopefully a future software update will remedy the situation. Have you experienced difficulty reading information on the Apple Watch Ultra's screen in low light? Let us know in the comments.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[If you have an iPhone 15 and drive a BMW, it might be best to avoid charging the device with the vehicle's wireless charging pad for now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/BMW-Logo-iPhone-15-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1489" height="744" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914891" /><br/>
Over the past week, some BMW owners have complained that their iPhone 15's NFC chip no longer works after charging the device with their vehicle's wireless charging pad, according to comments shared <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-apple-pay-issue-bmw-related.2404307/">on the MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DeeSoS3xy/status/1707882090107465845">X</a>, formerly known as Twitter. Affected customers say the iPhone goes into a data recovery mode with a white screen, and the NFC chip is no longer functional after the device reboots.<br/>
<br/>
In an iPhone, the NFC chip powers features like Apple Pay and digital car keys. Affected users receive a "Could Not Set Up Apple Pay" error message in the Wallet app, and there does not appear to be a way to fix the problem. Some customers say Apple replaced their iPhone after confirming the NFC chip failed, but the replacement iPhone is then vulnerable to the same issue, so there is currently no permanent solution.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pay-Error.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="658" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914890" /><br/>
While complaints so far have come from iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max users, it is possible the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are also affected, so owners of any iPhone 15 model should proceed with caution until this issue is sorted.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear what the specific cause of the issue is, how many customers are affected, and which BMW models are affected. We've reached out to an Apple spokesperson for comment, and we'll update this story if we receive a response.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bmw/">BMW</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/01/bmw-charging-may-break-iphone-15-nfc-chip/">Warning: BMW Wireless Charging May Break iPhone 15&#039;s Apple Pay Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/warning-bmw-wireless-charging-may-break-iphone-15s-apple-pay-chip.2405806/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today said it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">plans to release an iOS 17 software update</a> with a bug fix for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max overheating issue</a>, and the company has since shared additional details about the matter with <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Cameras.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913544" /><br/>
Importantly, Apple said the issue is not related to the titanium frame. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/iphone-15-pro-overheating/">Contrary to a report</a> this week, Apple said the iPhone 15 Pro's design does not contribute to overheating. In fact, Apple said the titanium frame and aluminum substructure provide better heat dissipation than any previous-generation Pro models with stainless steel frames.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said some third-party apps have overloaded the A17 Pro chip for unknown reasons, including Instagram, Uber, and racing game Asphalt 9: Legends, and it is working with the developers of these apps to address the matter. Apple said its bug fix will not involve reducing the chip's performance in order to address the temperature-related issue, and it ensured that long-term performance will not be impacted.<br/>
<br/>
To reiterate Apple's statement:<blockquote>We have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected. The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity. We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update. Another issue involves some recent updates to third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system. We're working with these app developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out.</blockquote>More details are available in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">initial coverage of Apple's statement</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/">Apple Says iPhone 15 Pro&#039;s Titanium Frame Does Not Contribute to Overheating Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphone-15-pros-titanium-frame-does-not-contribute-to-overheating-issue.2405695/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple also says some recent updates to third-party apps have overloaded the system and contributed to the overheating issue. The report notes that some of these apps include Instagram, Uber, and the racing game Asphalt 9: Legends, and Apple is working with the developers of these apps to address the issue. The report adds that Instagram already introduced a fix as part of an update to the app released on Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says iPhone 15 Pro models may run warmer than expected during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device due to increased background activity. This is standard behavior for new iPhones and only a temporary condition.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's statement:<blockquote>We have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected. The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity.

It's quite possible that Apple might also make a bug fix available sooner with a smaller software update, such as iOS 17.0.3.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report, Apple will not be reducing the performance of the A17 Pro chip as part of the temperature-related bug fix. Apple also said the issue is not a safety risk and will not impact the long-term performance of affected iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said the iPhone 15 Pro's titanium frame and aluminum substructure <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/">do not contribute to the overheating issue</a>, ruling out a hardware problem.<br/>
<br/>
Not all iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max users have experienced overheating, and it's unclear how many customers are affected by the issue overall, but it should be resolved soon.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">Apple to Address iPhone 15 Pro Overheating Issue With iOS 17 Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-address-iphone-15-pro-overheating-issue-with-ios-17-update.2405682/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mac fans, rejoice! You can now enjoy the upgrades that come with macOS Sonoma, which was released to the public this week just a bit later than the major updates for the rest of Apple's platforms.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/top-stories-30sep2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914635" /><br/>
Apple isn't stopping there, of course, and it's already begun seeding iOS 17.1, macOS Sonoma 14.1, and other upcoming updates to developers and public beta testers. This week also saw some fresh rumors about the iPhone 16 (yes, already!), while discussion continues over thermal issues with the iPhone 15 Pro and Apple's controversial FineWoven accessories, so read on for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases macOS Sonoma With Desktop Widgets, Game Mode, and More</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma was released to the public this week</a> following over three months of beta testing. The free software update includes many new features and changes for the Mac, including interactive desktop widgets, a Game Mode, the ability to add websites to the Dock as web apps, several Safari improvements, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" /><br/>
We've shared a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macos-sonoma-features/">list of macOS Sonoma features worth checking out</a>, and additional details about the software update can be found in our in-depth <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything New in iOS 17.1 Beta 1</h2><br/>
Less than two weeks after Apple released iOS 17, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-public-beta-1/">first beta of iOS 17.1</a> is already available. As usual, there are a handful of new features and changes coming to the iPhone with this software update for Apple Music, AirDrop, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912331" /><br/>
We've put together <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/">a list of everything new in the first beta of iOS 17.1</a> with more details. The beta is now available for both developers and public beta testers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 to Include an Additional Capacitive 'Capture' Button</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">plans to add a new capacitive button to iPhone 16 models</a> that is internally known as the "Capture Button," according to <em>MacRumors</em> sources.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
It's unclear what this button will be used for, but given that it is expected to be positioned below the power button on the right side of the iPhone, it could be a more conveniently placed shutter button for the camera when shooting in landscape orientation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>22 New Features You May Have Missed in watchOS 10</h2><br/>
watchOS 10 is now available for the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer, and the software update includes several new features and changes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/22-Hidden-Features-in-watchOS-10-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2248" height="1264" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913396" /><br/>

If you are looking for some new tips and tricks on how to use your Apple Watch to its fullest, be sure to check out the list for some helpful recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Overheating Concerns Highlighted in Two More Reports</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max overheating concerns</a> continue to make headlines this week, with the topic highlighted by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>Bloomberg</em>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the titanium frame on iPhone 15 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/iphone-15-pro-overheating/">negatively impacts thermal efficiency</a>. Kuo believes that Apple will likely address the issue through future software updates, but he said improvements might be limited.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's FineWoven Cases for iPhone 15 Continue to Be Heavily Criticized</h2><br/>
Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/">FineWoven cases for iPhone 15 models have been heavily criticized</a> since they were released earlier this month, with some customers and media outlets complaining about the fabric exterior being prone to scratches and stains.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-FineWoven.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913676" /><br/>
We <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">recapped some of the negative feedback</a> last week, and the complaints have continued to surface. Apple has not commented on the matter so far.<br/>

		<title>Counter-Strike 2 Lacks Mac Support, Update Breaks CS:GO for macOS</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Valve this week released <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, the highly anticipated free upgrade for owners of <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>, but Mac owners were left in the lurch on launch day, with the upgrade breaking the game and seemingly no macOS version forthcoming.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914773" /><br/>
The title's release on Wednesday forced a 26GB update for everyone with <em>CS:GO</em>, including Mac users, but after installation those on macOS soon discovered that the update essentially makes the game unplayable because Steam subsequently attempts to launch an executable file for Windows. Some users have had to employ a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/3881596897258134490/">workaround</a> to reverse the change and access <em>CS:GO</em>, but it's less than ideal.<br/>
<br/>
Valve quietly removed the macOS symbol on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/">Steam's <em>Counter-Strike</em> product page</a>, while the only reference to this omission for <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> appears in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/faqs/steam-help/view/5ED2-ED8E-81F4-0C18#macos">Valve's official FAQ</a>. A question about Mac support is met with the response: "No. CS2 is not available for Mac at this time," but provides no additional information.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, Valve apparently failed to adequately warn Mac users, many of whom have racked up thousands of hours on <em>CS:GO</em> and spent hundreds of dollars on inventory purchases. One Mac gamer on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/16u35zu/cs2_on_mac_i_feel_so_deflated_right_now/">Reddit</a> wrote:<br/>
<blockquote>I have around 6,000 hours in CS:GO, about 500&#36; worth of inventory. Am I supposed to leave all that behind now? Just cherish them as memories of the past never to be experienced again? I really believed Valve would have released a macOS version CS2 too. They have publicly denounced Windows' gaming monopoly in the past. With MacOS Sonoma, powerful Apple silicon chips, and Apple making strides to make gaming possible on Mac (and Valve's commitment to making their games available to everyone) I guess we didn't see this coming. Or maybe we did, but we were stubborn. I guess with Valve's darling Steam Deck, macOS became redundant to them as a way to challenge windows gaming monopoly. I am sorry you guys had to hear this, but I feel so disappointed right now, in myself and in Valve. I'm sure most of you CS:GO players were as excited and hopeful as I was for the game's launch.</blockquote><em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> is one of the most popular and long-running games on macOS, with a large community following, so the lack of support and transparancy from Valve for Mac users upgrading to <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> is all the more bewildering.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/counter-strike-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914774" /><br/>
Based on recent updates to the <em>CS2</em> macOS depot, some users believe a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/16vtc8h/cs2_changes_on_steamdb_dont_mean_anything/">Mac version is in development</a>, but it would likely relate to Rosetta 2 rather than a version that natively supports Apple silicon. With no word on the subject from Valve, this remains purely speculation.<br/>
<br/>
The long-rumored game, officially announced in March, updates many much-loved maps, and uses Valve's in-house Source 2 engine, featuring sharper textures, more realistic lighting, and new geometry. We've reached out to Valve for comment on this story and will update readers if we hear back.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/">iOS 17.1 beta</a> released this week, iPhone users in the U.K. can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">add debit and credit cards from select banks</a> in the country to the Wallet app and view their available balances and latest transactions for those accounts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/uk-bank-account-apple-wallet-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914320" /><br/>
Apple calls this feature Connected Cards, and it's currently available in the U.K. only, but there is now evidence to suggest it will expand to the U.S. in the future.<br/>
<br/>
As discovered by software researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1707956080628687258">Aaron</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1707956080628687258">@aaronp613</a>), the following fine print is shown in the Wallet app when setting up the feature in the U.K.:<blockquote>You permit Apple (Apple Payments Services Ltd (UK) or Apple Processing LLC (US)) to consolidate your account information and provide it to you. We do not store or share this information.</blockquote>Based on this fine print, <em>MacRumors</em> discovered a <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/connected-cards/">legal document on Apple's website</a> explicitly mentioning that the Connected Cards feature will eventually be available to U.S. residents, with personal data to be processed by Apple Processing LLC:<blockquote>If you are in the United States, Connected Cards is provided by Apple Processing LLC; if you are in the United Kingdom, Connected Cards is provided by Apple Payment Services Ltd (together, "Apple").</blockquote>It's unclear when Connected Cards will launch in the U.S., or which banks will participate in the country. In the U.K., the feature relies on the country's open banking framework, but it's unclear how it would work stateside. Earlier this year, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it expected to <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/laying-the-foundation-for-open-banking-in-the-united-states/">finalize an open banking rule in 2024</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Tuesday released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of the company's Mac operating system. &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; introduces interactive desktop widgets, web apps, new videoconferencing features, and updated capabilities across the platform.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/50-New-Features-and-Changes-Worth-Checking-Out-in-macOS-Sonoma.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913938" /><br/>
In this article, we've selected 50 new features and lesser-known changes that are worth checking out if you're upgrading. What do you think of &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; so far? Let us know in the comments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="1._set_widget_color_options">1. Set Widget Color Options</h2><br/>
When not in use, interactive desktop widgets fade into the background by taking on a monochrome style, allowing you to concentrate on the active app or window. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/monochrome-desktop-widgets.jpg" alt="settings" width="2214" height="916" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914508" /><br/>
If you prefer this look, you can make it permanent by going to System Settings -> Desktop & Dock. In the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a>" section, set Widget Style to Monochrome.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2._system_settings_navigation">2. System Settings Navigation</h2><br/>
In macOS Ventura, Apple replaced System Preferences with System Settings to align it with iOS and iPadOS, but the way controls were organized left many users wanting.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-tidbits2.jpg" alt="" width="1048" height="534" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899401" /><br/>
The same System Settings interface remains in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, but it is now easier to navigate through different menu screens you have visited without continually scrolling through the sidebar, thanks to the addition of backward and forward buttons.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="3._facetime_reactions">3. FaceTime Reactions</h2><br/>
Apple has changed the way <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> integrates with the menu bar. The video effects options no longer appear in the Control Center, and instead have a new home in a dedicated green &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; menu bar item, which also includes a mini webcam view and buttons to trigger Reactions. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-tidbits1.jpg" alt="" width="1359" height="964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899402" /><br/>
Reactions include Love, Like, Dislike, Balloons, Rain, Confetti, Lasers, and Fireworks. Some reactions are even triggered automatically by the user's physical actions: One thumb up triggers a Like, and two thumbs up are attended by Fireworks. Similarly, one thumb down counts as a dislike, and two thumbs down initiates a rain shower.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="4._safari_profiles">4. Safari Profiles</h2><br/>
Safari has gained a new feature called Profiles, which is designed to help keep your browsing separate for different use cases like Work, School, or Personal. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-tidbits3.jpg" alt="" width="846" height="436" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899403" /><br/>
Go to the Profiles section in Safari -> Settings..., and you can create custom profiles, choose a symbol and color for each one, and select a Favorites folder. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/safari-profile-settings.jpg" alt="settings" width="836" height="452" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914509" /><br/>
Profiles silo your history, Tab Groups, and cookies, and you can also assign specific extensions to different profiles to optimize your browsing experience based on the task at hand.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="5._seamless_keyboard_input_and_dictation">5. Seamless Keyboard Input and Dictation</h2><br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; supports simultaneous use of keyboard input and Dictation, without any disruption in your flow of thought.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-tidbits4.jpg" alt="" width="2339" height="1146" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899405" /><br/>
In other words, you can keep typing after hitting the Dictation shortcut (assignable in System Settings -> Keyboard). So whenever your fingers need a rest, you can complete the sentence you were just typing by saying it out loud.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="6._presenter_overlay">6. Presenter Overlay</h2><br/>
When you're in a &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; or Zoom call, click-hold the green traffic light in the corner of an open app window and you'll see a screen sharing option, while a new Presenter Overlay feature can be used to keep you on screen and better able to point to details.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-tidbits7.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899410" /><br/>
When on a video call, you can either place yourself inside a movable bubble in the corner of the window or desktop that you're sharing, or you can bring on-screen content into the background of your own environment so that it looks as if you're standing just in front of it. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="7._dock_web_apps">7. Dock Web Apps</h2><br/>
Thanks to a new option in Safari, you can now create standalone web apps and add them to your Dock, alongside your regular apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-tidbits6.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899411" /><br/>
All you have to do is visit a website in Safari and select File -> Add to Dock.... You can then give the web app a name and even change its icon. When you open a docked web app, it will open in its own separate window that includes back and forward buttons for simple navigation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="8._caps_lock_is_on">8. Caps Lock Is On</h2><br/>
If the Caps Lock key on your keyboard is enabled in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, a handy indicator appears right near the cursor, so you're less likely to TYPE LIKE THIS BY ACCIDENT and get your passwords wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/CAPS-LOCK-symbol.jpg" alt="" width="854" height="364" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914524" /><br/>
Apple has also made the text cursor a little thicker, and its color now changes relative to the active application, so you'll have a better idea of which window your text is going to appear in when you start typing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="9._open_notes_in_pages">9. Open Notes in Pages</h2><br/>
You can now send notes from the Notes app directly to Pages. Simply open the note, click the Share button, then choose Open in Pages from the share sheet.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/open-notes-pages.jpg" alt="notes" width="2548" height="1108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914525" /><br/>
From there you can continue to edit the note in Pages, then save it or export it as a PDF, Word file, EPUB, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="10._iphone_widgets_on_your_mac">10. iPhone Widgets on Your Mac</h2> <br/>
Thanks to Apple's Continuity feature and its ability to sync with your devices, the widget library includes widgets from your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in all available sizes. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/widgets-macos.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901433" /><br/>
So even if you don't have the corresponding Mac app, you can still use the iOS widget right on your desktop. Simply drag it from the gallery into an available space.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-widgets-on-mac.jpg" alt="settings" width="1430" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914526" /><br/>
If you have more than one &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, you can also choose which widgets show up in your Mac's widgets library. Go to System Settings -> Desktop & Dock, and in the "&zwnj;Widgets&zwnj;" section, click the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; dropdown to select the device that you want to sync to. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="_11._showhide_desktop_"> 11. Show/Hide Desktop </h2><br/>
By default, &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; hides all windows when you click on your wallpaper. This is handy if you tend to have a bunch of files on the screen that you need access to. But if you find this behavior maddening, you can limit it to happen only when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/">Stage Manager</a> is enabled.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/click-wallpaper-reveal-desktop.jpg" alt="" width="1638" height="656" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914527" /><br/>
Go to System Settings -> Desktop & Dock. In the Desktop & &zwnj;Stage Manager&zwnj; section, look for the option Click wallpaper to reveal desktop, then click Always and choose Only in &zwnj;Stage Manager&zwnj; instead. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="12._text_prediction">12. Text Prediction</h2><br/>
Thanks to improved machine learning technology, Apple has made macOS a lot more helpful, because it can better predict what you're going to type next. Apple says it has adopted a "transformer language model" that can even personalize prediction for individual users, learning your personal preferences and word choices to be more useful when typing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macos-text-prediction.jpg" alt="" width="870" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914528" /><br/>
As you type, the predicted text appears ahead of the cursor. If it has accurately predicted what you want to type, press the spacebar and macOS will fill it in for you. After using ‌‌&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;‌‌ for a few weeks, you should notice that the suggestions are much better at predicting what you want to say and presenting words for you to autofill. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/predictive-text-off.jpg" alt="settings" width="1380" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914529" /><br/>
If you find all of this distracting, you can turn it off. Go to System Settings -> Keyboard. Next to Input Sources, click Edit…. In the next window, toggle off the switch next to Show inline predictive text. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="13._managing_pdfs_in_notes">13. Managing PDFs in Notes</h2><br/>
When you drag PDFs into Notes, they are now presented full-width in the note, making it easier to view and interact with them. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/notes-pdf-viewing.jpg" alt="" width="2284" height="1108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914530" /><br/>
Notes is no longer restricted to rendering the first page of a PDF. You can now view the individual pages of a document you're reviewing right inside the note, which is really handy for previewing multiple PDFs in the same note. You also get a row of thumbnails across the top of the PDF that you can click to navigate to a specific page more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="14._link_notes_together">14. Link Notes Together</h2><br/>
Apple has made its stock Notes app significantly more useful by adding the simple yet powerful ability to link notes and connect related notes together. With just a few clicks, you can create links between notes in ‌&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, making it easy to jump from one idea to another. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/linked-notes-macos.jpg" alt="" width="1538" height="966" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914531" /><br/>
One way of adding a new link is by right-clicking on a space, word or phrase in any note and selecting Add Link from the contextual menu. You can also use the Command-K shortcut. This will let you link to another note by typing in its title. Using the "Name" field, you can create an optional alternative title for the link, or just stick with the original title for clarity. Once you're done, the link appears as hyperlink-style underlined text in your note, and clicking it snaps you straight into the note you linked to.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="15._link_from_a_list_of_notes">15. Link From a List of Notes</h2><br/>
The Notes app also offers an additional, quicker way to add links: Typing two greater-than symbols (>>) into a note invokes a list containing your six most recently modified notes, and tapping one instantly adds a link to that note.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/link-notes-recent-list.jpg" alt="" width="966" height="506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914532" /><br/>
The same feature can be found in iOS, meaning you can now create wiki-style collections of interlinked notes, allowing you to organize your thoughts or discover new connections and associations between ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="16._studio_light_and_background_blur">16. Studio Light and Background Blur</h2><br/>
Studio Light is now available in macOS when using video conferencing apps, on Studio Display and Mac models with Apple silicon, without the need for Continuity Camera. In the &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; menu bar UI, you can darken the background and illuminate your face using the Studio Light intensity slider.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/facetime-studio-light-portrait.jpg" alt="FaceTime" width="1780" height="956" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914535" /><br/>
With the Portrait slider, you can also control the amount of background blur, adding more or less blur to the depth-of-field effect.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="17._choose_center_stage_camera">17. Choose Center Stage Camera</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, Continuity Camera automatically detects your face and frames you in the center, without you having to enable Center Stage. Still, turning on Center Stage keeps you centered in the camera frame as you move around. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/center-stage-continuity-camera.jpg" alt="center stage" width="1620" height="978" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914537" /><br/>
Choose Center Stage from the Video menu in the menu bar. To switch between the rear cameras on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, click the arrow next to Center Stage, then choose Main or Ultra Wide. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="18._find_messages_faster_">18. Find Messages Faster </h2><br/>
Previously in macOS, you could type a word or phrase in the search field of Apple's Messages app and it would return matching results, but there was no way to filter messages to more easily find what you were looking for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/messages-search.jpg" alt="" width="1030" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914534" /><br/>
That's changed in ‌&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;‌, and now you can combine multiple filters. If you're looking for images from a certain person, for example, you can type in "photos" and then the person's name, clicking each search filter to narrow down your search results.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="19._remove_all_url_tracking">19. Remove All URL Tracking</h2><br/>
Safari can remove tracking parameters from URLs in order to prevent cross-website tracking. When a tracking parameter is detected while browsing or copying a link, Safari strips the identifying components of the URL, while leaving the rest intact. The links still work as expected, but no longer have unique identifiers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/safari-advanced-tracking-protection-mac.jpg" alt="settings" width="2418" height="1354" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905304" /><br/>
To enable the feature for all browsing, open Safari -> Settings..., click the Advanced tab, make sure the box is checked next to Use advanced tracking and fingerprint protection, then choose "in all browsing" in the dropdown.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="20._safari_favicons">20. Safari Favicons</h2><br/>
In Safari 17, if you have the Favorites Bar enabled (View -> Show Favorites Bar in Safari's menu bar) the favicon for each site will appear beside its title, allowing you to more easily spot it in the bar.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/hide-safari-favicons.jpg" alt="" width="738" height="436" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905937" /><br/>
Favicons can certainly be handy, but they can make your browser interface look too busy and cluttered. Another possible issue with the space they take up is that if you have a full row of websites in your Favorites Bar, some of them will be lopped off the viewable area, and you may have to click the double chevron icon at the far right to reveal them.<br/>
<br/>
If this happens in your case, don't worry. It's not obvious, but you can easily prevent favicons from appearing in the Favorites Bar. Simply right-click anywhere on the bar and uncheck Show Icons in the pop-up menu.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="21._automatically_close_safari_tabs">21. Automatically Close Safari Tabs</h2><br/>
macOS can now close Safari's browser tabs on your behalf, based on when you last viewed them. Select Safari -> Settings... in the menu bar, then click the Tabs section. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/auto-close-tabs-safari.jpg" alt="safari" width="1672" height="878" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914539" /><br/>
Next to "Automatically close tabs" you'll find options to make the browser auto-close tabs that have not been viewed After One Day, After One Week, or After One Month.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="22._share_passwords_with_family">22. Share Passwords With Family</h2><br/>
Staying in Safari Settings, the Passwords menu now has a Share Passwords with Family option. This allows you to create a group of trusted contacts that you can share passwords and passkeys with across devices. (Passkeys let users sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices: With a fingerprint, a face scan, or a screen lock PIN.)<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/family-passwords.jpg" alt="safari" width="1462" height="890" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914540" /><br/>
Using the new feature, passwords and passkeys for shared media accounts, utilities, bills, and more can be provided to multiple people, and each person in the group can access, add to, and change passwords that are shared.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="23._clean_up_verification_codes">23. Clean Up Verification Codes</h2><br/>
These days, many websites and services use one-time passcodes sent via SMS or over email for verification purposes, but these one-time codes can soon clog up your Mail inbox and Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/cleanup-verification-codes.jpg" alt="safari" width="1404" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914541" /><br/>
In &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, there's a new option to have those messages auto-delete after the code is autofilled and used to authenticate a login. Go to Safari -> Settings... and click the Password section. Under "Verification Codes," you can toggle the switch next to Clean Up Automatically.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="24._set_private_browsing_search_engine">24. Set Private Browsing Search Engine</h2><br/>
In Safari, you can set different search engines for normal and Private Browsing modes. For example, you may want to set Google as the default search engine in regular browsing mode and a different search engine such as DuckDuckGo in Private Browsing mode for privacy reasons.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/private-browsing-search.jpg" alt="safari" width="1672" height="596" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914543" /><br/>
Go to Safari -> Settings..., click the Search section, then select a browser from the Private Browsing search engine dropdown.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="25._private_browsing_authentication">25. Private Browsing Authentication</h2><br/>
If you have any Private Browsing tabs open in Safari and then leave your computer, Apple's browser now requires <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication or your Mac password to access them again.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/private-browsing-authenticate.jpg" alt="safari" width="1672" height="740" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914542" /><br/>
If you don't tend to leave your Mac unlocked or find the authentication requirement annoying, you can turn it off pretty easily: Go to Safari -> Settings..., click the Privacy section, then uncheck the box next to Require &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; to view locked tabs.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="26._per-website_app_extension_settings">26. Per-Website App Extension Settings</h2><br/>
In Safari, third-party app extensions have gained per-website privacy settings where relevant, allowing you to control access for all extensions with access to user data.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/per-website-app-extension-settings.jpg" alt="safari" width="1672" height="1184" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914769" /><br/>
You can find the "Edit websites..." for each app extension in the Extensions section of Safari's Settings window.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="27._disable_pointer_acceleration">27. Disable Pointer Acceleration</h2><br/>
Gamers rejoice – you can now disable pointer acceleration in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;. By default in macOS, the pointer moves more quickly for fast mouse movements and more precisely for slow mouse movements. Previously there was no way to prevent this natively, but that's changed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/disable-pointer-acceleration.jpg" alt="" width="1484" height="814" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914547" /><br/>
Go to System Settings -> Mouse -> Advanced..., then toggle off the switch next to Pointer acceleration.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="28._audio_message_improvements">28. Audio Message Improvements</h2><br/>
When recording an audio message, you're now able to pause and then continue recording the same message before sending. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/audio-messages-transcribed.jpg" alt="messages" width="764" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914549" /><br/>
Additionally, when listening to audio messages you received, a long click on the play button lets you opt to play back at up to 2x speed. Received audio messages are automatically transcribed, too.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="29._notes_formatting_additions">29. Notes Formatting Additions</h2><br/>
Block Quote formatting makes it easy to visually offset a section of writing with a quote bar, while Monospaced formatting has been updated to Monostyled, for inset text with a distinct background.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/notes-formatting.jpg" alt="notes" width="1140" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914551" /><br/>
You can find these in the Notes menu bar under Format, or by clicking the text style icon when a note is open.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="30._easier_autocorrect_editing_">30. Easier Autocorrect Editing </h2><br/>
Autocorrection now briefly underlines autocorrected words, and you can right-click an underlined word to reveal and choose the original word that you typed. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/autocorrect-improved.jpg" alt="autocorrect" width="680" height="196" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914555" /><br/>
macOS will also learn your typing habits over time for each app, and avoid corrections that you revert. This also applies to explicit language, which will be added to your personal vocabulary list. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="31._activate_game_mode">31. Activate Game Mode</h2><br/>
Game Mode gives games the highest priority access to your CPU and GPU, lowering usage for background tasks. It turns on automatically when you fullscreen any game via the green button in the top-left corner of the game's window. When you enter full screen in this way, a Game Mode menu appears in the menu bar. You can use this menu to confirm that Game Mode is turned on for your game.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macos-sonoma-2021-imac-game-mode-menu-bar-turn-game-mode-off.jpg" alt="" width="1560" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913973" /><br/>
Game Mode also turns off automatically when you stop viewing your game in full screen. You can also turn it off while your game is still in full screen mode: From the Game Mode menu in the menu bar, choose Turn Game Mode Off.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="32._high_performance_screen_sharing">32. High Performance Screen Sharing</h2><br/>
Screen Sharing is its own app in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;. It's located in Applications/Utilities, and includes a list of all computers you've connected to in the past, the ability to see all computers on your local network with screen sharing enabled, and the option to create groups of computers. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/high-performance-screen-sharing.jpg" alt="screen sharing" width="860" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914397" /><br/>
It also features a high performance mode when a screen sharing connection has been established. Click the info (i) button next to a connection, and change the Screen Sharing Type from Standard to High Performance. High performance mode allows you to use the native resolution of the host computer's display, reduces latency, improves image quality, and features HDR and multi-monitor support. The feature is available on Macs with Apple silicon running &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; or later.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="33._communication_safety">33. Communication Safety</h2><br/>
Communication Safety is an opt-in feature that warns children when sending or receiving photos that contain nudity. It's enabled by default for children under the age of 13 who are signed in with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> and part of a Family Sharing group, but parents can also enable it for older teens as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/communication-safety-mac.jpg" alt="settings" width="1484" height="762" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914394" /><br/>
When the feature is enabled in System Settings -> Screen Time -> Communication Safety, photos and videos containing nudity are automatically blurred in supported apps including Messages and &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;, and the child will be warned about viewing sensitive content. The warning also provides children with ways to get help. It uses on-device processing to detect photos and videos containing nudity, ensuring that Apple and third parties cannot access the content, and that end-to-end encryption is preserved in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="34._live_speech">34. Live Speech</h2><br/>
Using the new Live Speech accessibility feature, you can type on your Mac and have your words spoken aloud, or directly into apps like ‌&zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;‌ audio. Live Speech can be set up in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; by going to Settings -> Accessibility -> Live Speech, where you can choose a voice to use, and save commonly used phrases.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/live-speech-mac.jpg" alt="settings" width="1430" height="907" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914405" /><br/>
Alternatively, you can record yourself reading and make a Personal Voice for use with Live Speech. Go to System Settings -> Accessibility -> Personal Voice, then tap Create a Personal Voice.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="35._copy_icloud_link">35. Copy iCloud Link</h2><br/>
You can now share photos and videos stored in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-photo-library/">iCloud Photos</a> by generating an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> link.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/copy-icloud-link.jpg" alt="photos" width="1514" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914432" /><br/>
Simply select a photo or drag a selection box over several photos, click the Share button, then select Copy &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Link, and it will be copied to your clipboard ready for pasting in an email or message.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="36._wallpaper_to_screen_saver_">36. Wallpaper to Screen Saver </h2><br/>
Sonoma brings all the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> screensavers to your Mac - they download on demand to save on storage, and they look great. The way to get the best out of them though, is to use the same video for your wallpaper and screensaver. You can do this using the Show as screen saver / wallpaper toggle in System Settings -> Wallpaper, and Screen Saver.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/sonoma-screensavers.jpg" alt="settings" width="1430" height="1240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914505" /><br/>
With the toggle enabled, your icons and app windows fade out and the desktop wallpaper starts to move when the screen saver comes on.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="37._system_settings_in_spotlight">37. System Settings in Spotlight</h2><br/>
Sonoma lets you toggle system settings like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a>, Focus Modes, and more directly in Spotlight search.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/bluetooth-spotlight-setting.jpg" alt="spotlight" width="1249" height="343" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914629" /><br/>
You can still access these settings in Control Center and the System Settings app, but some users will find this method a little quicker. It's the same small yet welcome quality of life improvement that users have seen in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="38._icloud_passwords_extension">38. iCloud Passwords Extension</h2><br/>
Apple's &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; password manager can now be used in Chrome for Mac, Microsoft Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers, thanks to an updated &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Passwords extension that works in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/icloud-passwords-extension.jpg" alt="" width="1074" height="504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914626" /><br/>
In other words, you don't need to open Safari or migrate your &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; passwords to another password manager. The Chrome extension can also AutoFill passwords and one-time codes, save new passwords, and lets you right-click QR codes to set up code generators. <br/>

<h2 id="39._people__pets">39. People & Pets</h2><br/>
Regular users of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app will be undoubtedly familiar with the People album, which tries to identify faces in your pictures so that you can label people with their proper names and use that label as an organizing element in your library or as a discoverable tag.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/people-and-pets-photos.jpg" alt="photos" width="1288" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914431" /><br/>
In addition to people, the ‌&zwnj;Photos&zwnj;‌ app in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; can recognize cats and dogs, so you can have your pets automatically sorted into albums. Accordingly, the People album has been renamed the "People & Pets" album. To manually assign your furry friends, type "pets" into the search field in your library, and you can go about identifying any unnamed pets.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="40._auto-hide_menu_bar_options">40. Auto-Hide Menu Bar Options</h2><br/>
In System Settings -> Control Center, there are new options to control when the menu bar automatically hides. <br/>

Scroll down to the "Menu Bar Only" section and click the dropdown next to Automatically hide and show the menu bar, and you'll be able to choose from Always, On Desktop Only, On Full Screen Only, and Never.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="41._weather_units">41. Weather Units</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, the Weather app has received an overhaul, and now includes new features like the ability to view the previous day's weather, and a new moon module that tells you the phases of the moon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/weather-settings.jpg" alt="weather" width="2434" height="1486" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914441" /><br/>

Apple has added a handy little list function to the Reminders app to help you when you're out to pick up some groceries. When you create a list with the new "Groceries" list type (named "Shopping" outside the U.S), you can input various foods and sundries and have them organized automatically by category. The organization makes it easier to find what you need when you're at the grocery store, or out shopping.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/groceries-reminder-list.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="966" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914640" /><br/>
The available category types in Reminders include Produce, Breads & Cereals, Frozen Foods, Snacks & Candy, Meat, Dairy, Eggs & Cheese, Bakery, Baking Items, Household Items, Personal Care & Health, and Wine, Beer & Spirits.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="43._reminder_list_column_view">43. Reminder List Column View</h2><br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="44._hey_siri">44. <del datetime="2023-09-28T14:08:26+00:00">Hey</del> Siri</h2><br/>
In macOS on machines with Apple silicon, you can just say "‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>‌" to activate ‌&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌, dropping the "Hey" that's been used as a wake word for years. ‌&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌ will activate when you say the ‌&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌ word, so you can speak more naturally.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="48._visual_look_up_enhancements">48. Visual Look Up Enhancements</h2><br/>
Visual Look Up in &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; has been vastly improved, so you can now find similar recipes from photos of food, map routes to stores identified in photos, and identify the meaning of signs and symbols on things like laundry tags. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/visual-lookup-video.jpg" alt="" width="1658" height="1300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914675" /><br/>
You can also find out information about things that appear in paused video frames.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="49._add-only_calendar_access">49. Add-Only Calendar Access</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> is not working as expected for some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> users, an issue that is likely linked to the transition to USB-C. There are multiple complaints <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-not-working-with-wired-carplay.2404203/">from <em>MacRumors</em> readers</a> and Reddit users who are unable to get &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; to work with their new devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/CarPlay-SharePlay.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899259" /><br/>
Cable type and available port options are a common theme in the &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; reports, with many of the functionality problems linked to USB-A to USB-C cables. Many cars, even some that are more recent, have only USB-A ports and not USB-C ports, so a USB-A to USB-C cable is required.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it appears that not all USB-A to USB-C cables on the market will work, and some that work in certain vehicles will not work in others. A Reddit user explains:<blockquote>I got in my car this morning and plugged my phone in with a USB-A to USB-C cord in order to use Carplay, and found it does not connect. It charges, but no Carplay. In my Carplay settings on my phone, it says the name of my car as if it were connected, but nothing shows up on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
I work at a dealership so I tried it in a bunch of different cars and nothing worked. My car doesn't have any USB-C ports, so I tried the Apple-supplied C to C cable in a 2023 model and it worked no problem. So it seems that either USB-A to USB-C does not allow Carplay, or it simply does not work anymore with non-Apple chargers.</blockquote>Other &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; users chimed in and mentioned having the same problems, though some were able to get &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; to work with USB-A to USB-C cables like those from Belkin. Several people had success getting &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; working with a USB-A port using <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBelkin-Charge-Type-C-Note10-Nintendo%2Fdp%2FB08557ZVLV">Belkin's BoostCharge USB-A to USB-C cable</a>, but others had no luck.<blockquote>Having tried 2 good quality cables I called Apple Support about this. They proceeded through various potential remedies which didn't work. The call ended with me agreeing to try the cable supplied with the phone, after getting a suitable adaptor. When I got home I tried 4 more cables. 3 of them worked, these being ones from Sony, Samsung and Nintendo (I think). Today I tried the Apple cable + adaptor and that works as well. The good quality cables (3 of) all previously gave me no problems, mainly charging but also a high speed PC to VR headset connection. iPhone to Windows PC connection worked fine with one of them (I could connect to my phone in iTunes). I suspect that there is a specification point that the 3 "good quality" cables have missed. If so, I don't know if it is the car or the iPhone that is particular about this spec. point!</blockquote>Trying a variety of cables, specifically those from known brands and with data transfer support, seems to be the best way to get &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; to work, but it is worth noting that some people have not been able to get &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; to work <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarPlay/comments/16qk5hr/iphone_15_carplay_not_working/">even with</a> Apple's adapters and cables. From Reddit:<blockquote>I have the exact same problem. Have tried (and bought) several different high quality cables, nothing works. Been through all the troubleshooting scripts and AppleCare+. Seems like either an iPhone 15 or an iOS 17 problem.</blockquote>One <em>MacRumors</em> reader that contacted us said that the issue had been reported to Apple and that Apple is working on a fix for the problem. Apple could perhaps implement a software update that improves compatibility with some cables, or the company could better explain which USB-C cables will work with the new iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
While most of the complaints have been from car owners who are limited to USB-A connection ports, there <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-not-working-with-wired-carplay.2404203/?post=32553705#post-32553705">are also reports</a> from some who have vehicles with USB-C ports and even some complaints about wireless &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;. One <em>MacRumors</em> thread suggests that VPNs <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-not-working-with-wired-carplay.2404203/post-32556747">may be responsible</a> for some recent connection issues, though turning off a VPN did not work for all users.<blockquote>Oy, I just went to my car to check and am having the same issue. If a VPN is activated when the car starts, the car will not pick up CarPlay at all. If the VPN is disabled, CarPlay starts, then if I turn the VPN back on CarPlay crashes.</blockquote>With the wide range of reports, there appear to be multiple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; issues at the current time. &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; users may need to transition to different cables, but Apple may need to release a software update to solve some of the &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; problems.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/tim-cook-interview-apple-vision-pro-b2420852.html">The Independent</a></em> that the upcoming Vision Pro is part of his nightly routine, and that it has convinced him that spatial computing is the future. He described using the Vision Pro as an industry-defining "aha" moment.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" /><br/>
"There are huge differences in how people look at it, depending on if they've read about it or actually tried it," said Cook. "I believe even more about how profound spatial computing is. When you've tried it, it's an aha moment, and you only have a few of those in a lifetime."<br/>
<br/>
While analysts don't expect the Vision Pro headset to sell well during its first year of availability, and have expressed skepticism about Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/">ability to bring costs down</a>, Cook remains positive about the headset's future impact.<br/>
<br/>
Cook has been in Europe to meet with app developers, and he said that so far, Apple is seeing "some incredible work." He went on to explain that there's "so much [developer] excitement out there" over the headset, which is set to come out in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The headset will have a gaming focus, and Apple is solidifying its reputation for gaming with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models. There's an A17 Pro in the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max that allows for console-quality gaming, and Apple is working with developers to bring console games to the device. Cook said that Apple is "very serious" about gaming and that it is "not a hobby" for the company. "We're putting all of ourselves out there," he said.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple etches <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> displays with small QR codes that let it precisely track the number of defective screens that are thrown out by suppliers, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-a-hidden-bar-code-in-iphone-screens-saved-apple-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars">The Information</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>

One barcode is the size of a grain of sand and can be viewed only with special equipment, while the other is on the inside of the display along the bezel. Apple spent millions of dollars developing the barcode process and installing laser scanning equipment at Lens Technology and Biel Crystal, two manufacturers that make the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s cover glass.<br/>
<br/>
With this system, Apple has a precise count of every piece of glass produced by Lens and Biel, and an exact read on how much material is wasted due to defects. A source that spoke to <em>The Information</em> said that when the barcodes were first implemented, Apple found that as many as three out of 10 pieces of cover glass were thrown away due to manufacturing errors, and with pressure from Apple, the suppliers have been able to cut that down to one in 10. Because Apple pays for production, lowering error rates has saved it hundreds of millions of dollars.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has used the display barcodes to streamline manufacturing since 2020, and the company is able to see which company made the glass and the date it was manufactured for tracking production level and yield rate. Other &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; components have had small barcodes to trace defects or find the source of leaks for many years, but prior to the display system, barcodes were primarily used for metal parts.<br/>

Current information suggests that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 16 Plus will maintain the same dimensions as the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, with the only difference being an increase in weight of around 2 grams for both models – 173g for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, and 203g for &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus will be available in the same 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes as their predecessors.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of the dimensions, however, the base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 16 Plus are expected to feature a redesigned camera bump, with a vertical camera arrangement similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12. They are also likely to include a capacitive Action button and potentially even an all-new capacitive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">"Capture Button."</a><br/>
<br/>
In terms of materials, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 16 Plus should use the same type of aluminum found on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; chassis, and will also feature matte back glass. The choice of materials is unlikely to have any significant impact on the weight of the devices, with the increase being a consequence of minor design changes.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro Max will feature an increase in display size compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, measuring roughly 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches, respectively. To be more precise, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro will have a 6.27-inch display (159.31 mm), while the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro Max will feature a 6.85-inch (174.06 mm) panel. <br/>
<br/>
This represents a noticeable increase of 0.2 inches for both models. As a result, the dimensions of the device as a whole will increase. The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro and 16 Pro Max will be slightly taller than their predecessors, while also being somewhat wider. Interestingly, the width of both devices appears to align with their respective &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14-series counterparts, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro and 14 Pro Max.<br/>

As far as materials are concerned, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro Max are expected to maintain the same Grade 5 Titanium used on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, with the same brushed finish and curved design. Similar to the base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro is also expected to feature a slightly larger Action Button, and an entirely new capacitive "Capture Button."<br/>
<br/>
It's worth emphasizing that the information presented here is remarkably early. The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is almost a whole year away, and the design is far from being finalized. While changes throughout development are always possible, significant deviations from the dimensions and weights we've listed are unlikely, and the information we've provided represents our best insight into the overall size of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
