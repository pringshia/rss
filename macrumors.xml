		<description><![CDATA[We're now less than four days away from Black Friday, and this means that you can already get all-time low prices across Apple's products line-up, from AirPods to MacBook Pro. Of course, there's no guarantee that better prices won't appear later in the holiday season, but if you want to shop right now these are the best deals currently available on each product.<br/>

<br/>
B&H Photo has been the only retailer with a consistent discount on Apple's second generation HomePod. Right now, you can get it in both colors for <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746861-REG/apple_mqj73ll_a_homepod_2nd_generation.html/kw/APHOMEPODMN/BI/2696/KBID/3612"><strong>&#36;279.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;299.00. While not a huge markdown, this continues to be the best price we've ever tracked.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We originally tracked the AirPods 2 for &#36;69.00 at Amazon in early November, but that sale quickly expired. For now, you can get the AirPods 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00. This version of the AirPods is perfect for anyone on your holiday shopping list who may be asking for a simple and reliable pair of wireless earbuds, particularly at this insanely low price tag. <br/>

<br/>
Moving to the Pro lineup, Verizon has the AirPods Pro 2 (Lightning) for <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-airpods-pro-2nd-generation%2F"><strong>&#36;184.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00.

<br/>
Lastly, the high-end AirPods Max are available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZHYWJS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;449.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;549.00. Discounts on the AirPods Max have been rare over the past few months, so this one is a second-best price on the over-ear headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZHYWJS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;99 OFF</div>AirPods Max for &#36;449.99</div></a></div><br/>

Afterwards, you'll get up to &#36;300 in bill credits over 36 months.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="verizon">Verizon</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-15-candycanes.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922707" /><br/>
At <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-11557999?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2F">Verizon</a>, you can get a special bundle offer if you're interested in purchasing the new <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple-iphone-15-pro%2F">iPhone 15 Pro</a> this holiday season.

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple-iphone-15-pro%2F"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">FREE APPLE TV 4K</div>iPhone 15 Pro at Verizon</div></a></div><br/>

The Apple TV 4K promotion requires a smarpthone purchase on an eligible plan and ends on November 15, while the Apple One six month promotion requires a line subscribed to an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan.<br/>
<br/>
For last year's models, you can <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple-iphone-14-plus%2F">get four iPhone 14 Plus devices for free</a> along with four lines on Unlimited Welcome at &#36;120/month.

<br/>
Verizon is also a great place to buy stocking stuffers for techies during the holiday season with its abundant <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-14048362?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fdeals%2Fproducts%2F">accessory sales</a>.

Verizon's <a href="https://visible.pxf.io/c/153062/1007955/12909">Visible</a> brand has &#36;10 off its premium Visible+ service, now priced at &#36;35/month with the promo code 35FOR6 used at checkout.

The upgraded iPad from 2022 also has a great discount on Amazon right now, with the 64GB Wi-Fi model on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLCL22Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;349.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;449.00.

		<description><![CDATA[Anker's early Black Friday sale has transitioned into a full-fledged <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu">Black Friday event</a> today, so we're highlighting all of the best discounts you'll find in the new sale. With this sale, you can save up to 60 percent on Anker accessories, and you don't need to purchase more than one accessory at a time to get a bundle discount this time around. There are also still a few "mystery boxes" that can include hundreds of dollars in savings, if you're willing to risk not knowing what you're buying ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/anker-new-xmas.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923261" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Anker. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
In terms of the base sale, there are plenty of great accessories that you can buy to take advantage of the savings. A new highlight is the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/products/b1336-20000mah-power-bank-kit?ref=black-friday-sale&amp;variant=42726143852694">Prime 20,000 mAh Power Bank with 100W Charging Base</a> for &#36;129.50, down from &#36;184.99. If you just want a portable battery with a smart display, the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1289?ref=black-friday-sale&amp;variant=41974285041814">PowerCore 24,000 mAh Power Bank with Smart Digital Display</a> is at &#36;92.00, down from &#36;159.99.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO 60% OFF</div>Anker Black Friday Sale</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
At the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu">bottom of the Black Friday sale page</a>, Anker also has a few blind boxes on sale, priced at &#36;19.99 (up to &#36;219.99 in value) and at &#36;29.99 (up to &#36;219.99 in value). These mystery boxes include one Anker accessory, but you won't know what you're getting until they arrive. All items in the &#36;19.99 box are worth more than &#36;19.99, and all items in the &#36;29.99 box are worth more than &#36;29.99, so no matter what you'll be getting a deal.<br/>
<br/>
All mystery box items are non-returnable (with the exception of quality issues). These could net you a huge discount with a collection of solid stocking stuffers for the holidays, if you're willing to take the blind box risk. Anker's Black Friday sale will run through December 3.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 17, all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models offer a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/roadside-assistance-via-satellite/">roadside assistance via satellite feature</a> that allows users in the U.S. to contact roadside assistance company AAA for vehicle service when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf1c6oGZNrw">video shared today</a>, tech reviewer Brian Tong provided a look at the feature in action.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-roadside-assistance.jpg" alt="" width="1596" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910510" /><br/>
To use the feature, open the Messages app and start a new message. Next, type "roadside" into the address field. When there is no cellular and Wi-Fi coverage available, a "Roadside Assistance" option will appear. Tap on "Roadside Assistance" and follow the on-screen instructions to connect your iPhone to a Globalstar satellite and request help from AAA. You'll need to be outside with a clear view of the sky and horizon, according <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213886">to Apple</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Tong demoed the feature by having AAA come to jump-start his car's battery. The feature can also be used if you are locked out of your vehicle, have a flat tire, run out of fuel, and for other services offered by AAA.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wf1c6oGZNrw?si=domPxy2EuWlL5jUN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The feature is included free for two years starting at the time of activation of any new iPhone 14 or iPhone 15 model, with service covered per your AAA membership plan. If you aren't a AAA member, you can still use the service on a pay-per-use basis.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said roadside assistance via satellite is available "beginning" in the U.S., suggesting that it will expand the feature to additional countries over time, but it has not provided any specific details. In Canada, there is a AAA-like organization called CAA, so it would make sense for the service to expand to that country eventually.<br/>
<br/>
Roadside assistance via satellite is an extension of the Emergency SOS via satellite feature. Apple recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/emergency-sos-extra-year-iphone-14/">extended free usage of the satellite features</a> for an additional year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-roadside-assistance-feature-tested/">iPhone&#039;s Roadside Assistance via Satellite Feature Tested in New Video</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphones-roadside-assistance-via-satellite-feature-tested-in-new-video.2411543/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
This new sale beats the previous all-time low price seen earlier in November by about &#36;10. At a discount of &#36;180, this is just over 50 percent off the original price of the accessory and one of the best headphones-related Black Friday discount we've seen this season.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to be internally testing an iOS 17.1.2 update for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software in our website's analytics logs within the past few days.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-17.1.2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923208" /><br/>
As a minor update, iOS 17.1.2 should be focused on bug fixes, but it's unclear exactly which issues might be addressed. Some users have continued to experience Wi-Fi issues on iOS 17.1.1, released earlier this month, so perhaps iOS 17.1.2 will include the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/">fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple included in the iOS 17.2 beta. Some users have also experienced minor bugs related to push notifications and HomeKit.<br/>
<br/>
Apple typically does not release any software updates or betas during the week of U.S. Thanksgiving, as most corporate employees in the company are given the full week off due to the holiday. This means that iOS 17.1.2 is likely to be released next week, similar to how iOS 16.1.2 was released on November 30 last year.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1.1 already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/">fixed a BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup, and an issue preventing the Weather app widget from showing a snow icon.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 has been in beta testing for nearly a month now, and it is expected to be released in mid-December. The update includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/">many new features and changes</a>, including Apple's new Journal app, support for spatial video recording on iPhone 15 Pro models, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option for high-profile individuals, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/apple-preparing-ios-17-1-2/">Apple Preparing to Release iOS 17.1.2 Update for iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-release-ios-17-1-2-update-for-iphone.2411534/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Black Friday is now just four days away, and big discounts are in full swing across the Internet and in select retail location. In this article, we're focusing on Apple accessories like the AirTag, iPhone 15 cases, MagSafe chargers, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/accessories-xmas.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923178" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the AirTag 4-Pack, Amazon has the tracking accessory multi-pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932QJ2JZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00. This is a solid second-best price on this device, and you can get a solo AirTag for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0933BVK6T%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;23.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;29.00.<br/>

<br/>
For MagSafe Chargers, we're tracking two great deals at Amazon and Woot. Amazon has the MagSafe Charger for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08L5NP6NG%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;29.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;39.00, which is just a couple dollars off from the all-time low price on the accessory.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/magsafe-xmas.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923177" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08L5NP6NG%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;10 OFF</div>MagSafe Charger for &#36;29.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
At Woot, you can get the MagSafe Duo Charger for <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-magsafe-duo-fast-wireless-charger%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_2"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a> in new condition, down from &#36;129.00. This one is a new all-time low price for Black Friday 2023, and the steepest discount we've ever seen on this accessory from any retailer.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-magsafe-duo-fast-wireless-charger%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_2"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>MagSafe Duo Charger for &#36;79.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Lastly, Amazon has quite a few discounts on Apple's official MagSafe cases for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro. You can find every case listed below by model, and many are seeing multiple colors hitting record low prices. There's also the MagSafe FineWoven Wallet with Find My support for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPhone-FineWoven-Wallet-MagSafe%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7KT91%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;47.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;59.00.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Images purporting to depict a new battery designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro today leaked online, showing a new metal casing and a slightly larger capacity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
The images come from the leaker known as "<a href="https://twitter.com/kosutamisan/status/1726430084838617152?s=46">Kosutami</a>," who has disseminated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">accurate information</a> about Apple's plans in the past. If authentic, the images are the first to be shared of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;'s components.<br/>
<br/>
The battery is said to be designed for an early stage &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro prototype with a 3,355 mAh capacity. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> contains a 3,274 mAh battery, meaning that prototype &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models currently feature a battery that is just 2.5% larger. The new battery also features a redesigned connector.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battery of early stage iPhone 16 Pro Proto<br>Features glossy metal shell, 3355mAh Capacity(13.02Wh), LCV 4.48V(Limited Charge Voltage)<br>Current stage prototype has changed some design: from glossy surface to frosted metal shell, and with a redesigned connector<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Apple</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#appleinternal</a> <a href="https://t.co/QvguZ7CrtL">pic.twitter.com/QvguZ7CrtL</a></p>&mdash; Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1726430084838617152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div> <br/>
<br/>
The most significant change is the transition from a black foil casing, the likes of which have been used on every <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> model thus far, to a frosted metal shell. This change improves the thermal efficiency of the battery, with no significant impact on the component's weight. The Apple Watch used to feature batteries with black foil casing, but starting with the 40mm Apple Watch Series 7, Apple began adopting metal shells for improved thermals.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-40mm-battery-change-ifixit.jpg" alt="" width="1922" height="1133" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-923106" /><em>The new and old Apple Watch battery designs (via iFixit).</em></div><br/>
<br/>
The early component images appear to confirm information <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">shared last week</a> that said Apple plans to introduce a new thermal system on the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; to reduce overheating. In addition to batteries with metal shells on the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models, the entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is rumored to feature a graphene heat-sink to reduce overheating. Graphene has high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper, which is currently used in &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; heat-sinks. Apple has been interested in graphene for thermal management for some time, filing patents related to its exploration of the material for heat dissipation in portable devices.<br/>
<br/>
The moves appear to come partly in response to widely encountered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">overheating issues</a> experienced with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, which Apple ostensibly addressed through a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">software update</a> earlier this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/">First Alleged iPhone 16 Pro Component Leak Reveals Redesigned Battery</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-alleged-iphone-16-pro-component-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery.2411505/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will miss its original aim to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> in January 2024 and is now likely to release the mixed reality headset to consumers in March of next year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-vision-pro-setup.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923100" /><br/>
Writing in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-19/apple-in-house-technologies-team-eyes-making-cameras-screens-modems-batteries-lp5j5h6b?srnd=technology-vp">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman says Apple "still needs to get its distribution plans in shape and conduct further testing." Apple also typically holds its spring event in March, and company will likely use that to promote the headset and preview additional apps. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; reportedly has such a complex design that Apple has been forced to make "drastic cuts" to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-vision-pro-drastic-production-cuts/">production forecasts</a> because of difficulties with manufacturing. Apple is expected to make fewer than 400,000 units in 2024, and the headset will initially only launch in the US, only coming to more markets including Canada and the UK towards the end of next year.<br/>
<br/>
Select Apple retail employees in the United States have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-to-host-secretive-vision-pro-training-event/">sent to Apple's Cupertino headquarters</a> to receive Vision Pro training. Employees selected for training will be responsible for training other team members at their stores.<br/>
<br/>
When the Vision Pro launches, flagship stores will have dedicated Vision Pro hands-on areas, while other stores will have one or two units for customers to try.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last week seeded to developers a sixth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software designed to run the headset, and it includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/apple-vision-pro-onboarding-videos-visionos-beta-6/">new onboarding videos</a> shown to the user during the setup process, indicating that development work on the headset is nearing completion.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/apple-vision-pro-likely-launch-march-2024/">Apple Vision Pro Headset Likely to Launch Around March 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-headset-likely-to-launch-around-march-2024.2411499/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple eventually plans to build its own custom modem into cellular MacBook models that could arrive in 2028 at the earliest, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-MacBook-Air-15-in-color-lineup-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898453" /><br/>
Apple has reportedly been working on its own modem since 2018, as it seeks to move away from Qualcomm's component currently used in iPhones. The timeframe for launching the modem has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/">slipped several times</a> and is now expected to be ready around 2026, and Gurman now hears that Apple has plans for the chip appearing in other Apple devices further down the line.<br/>
<br/>
Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/apple-project-to-replace-modems-made-by-qualcomm-falls-further-behind-to-2026?srnd=technology-vp">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman says that Apple's custom technology aspirations include integrating an in-house modem into its system-on-a-chip (SoC), which would eventually see the launch of MacBooks with built-in cellular connectivity. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman says Apple will "probably need two or three additional years to get that chip inside cellular versions of the Apple Watch and iPad – and the Mac, once the part is integrated into the company's system-on-a-chip."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has explored the possibility of developing MacBooks with cellular connectivity in the past. Indeed, the company reportedly considered launching a MacBook Air with 3G connectivity, but former CEO Steve Jobs said in 2008 that Apple decided against it, since it would take up too much room in the case. An integrated SoC would solve that problem.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman's latest newsletter also said some of Apple's other ongoing in-house chip projects include camera sensors, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/apple-developing-custom-batteries-for-2025/">batteries</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/09/apple-in-house-modem-chips-2024/">combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a> that will eventually replace parts from Broadcom, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/microled-apple-watch-still-on-track-for-2025/">Micro-LED displays for Apple devices</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-watch-blood-glucose-up-to-seven-years-away/">non-invasive glucose monitoring system</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/macbook-integrated-cellular-modem-2028/">Apple Plans to Equip MacBooks With In-House Cellular Modems</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-plans-to-equip-macbooks-with-in-house-cellular-modems.2411497/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A massive discount has arrived for Apple's 9th generation iPad on Amazon, which has the 64GB Wi-Fi tablet for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;229.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;329.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/ipad-9-snowflakes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-874200" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This is the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 9th generation iPad, and Amazon has it in both Silver and Space Gray. The latter color does appear to have somewhat dwindling stock as of writing.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;99 OFF</div>9th Gen iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;229.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you want a bit more storage, you'll find a similar &#36;99 discount on the 256GB model. It's available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G96TFF7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;379.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;479.00 on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G96TFF7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;99 OFF</div>9th Gen iPad (256GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;379.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
This 2021 iPad lacks the design changes that arrived in the 10th generation models, but at this &#36;99 discount it's a great entry-level tablet for kids or family members who don't need a Pro-level tablet.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It's almost Black Friday, and tons of deals kicked off today ahead of the biggest shopping week of the year. This includes steep markdowns on Apple's AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/airpods-2-gingerbread-ornaments.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-874750" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the AirPods 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a> at Amazon, down from &#36;129.00. These were about &#36;10 cheaper earlier in the month, but that sale hasn't returned and at &#36;79.99, this is still a solid second-best price on the cheapest AirPods model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for &#36;79.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Secondly, Amazon has the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. This is the first time the new AirPods Pro model have returned to their all-time low price in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Raise your hand if you thought Apple was going to decide to support RCS messaging to enable better communication with green-bubble folks!<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/top-stories-18nov2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923044" /><br/>
That was certainly the biggest story of the week, but there was plenty more news including rumors about the timing of app sideloading support for users in the EU, developments coming in iOS 18, and a welcome change in watchOS 10.2 for swapping watch faces. Black Friday sales are also now in full swing, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple to Adopt RCS Messaging Standard for Better Interoperability With Android Devices</h2><br/>
In a bit of shocking news this week, Apple announced that it will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">add support for the Rich Communication Standard (RCS) standard</a> "later next year," allowing for better messaging interoperability with Android devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-rcs-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2776" height="1562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923042" /><br/>
Apple has long resisted adopting the successor to SMS and MMS messaging amid intense pressure from Google and Android device manufacturers, and it's unclear exactly what has changed Apple's mind other than perhaps ongoing pressure from regulators on various aspects of the company's business.<br/>
<br/>
While RCS will remain separate from iMessage, it will bring a number of advancements for communication between Apple and Android users, including enhanced security, higher-resolution photos and videos, audio messages, and much-improved group chats.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 Series Rumored to Have These 17 New Features</h2><br/>
It's still only November, but we’ve been hearing about a decent number of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/iphone-16-series-16-rumored-new-features/">potential upgrades for next year's flagship iPhone lineup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-Updated-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922680" /><br/>
From bigger displays on the Pro models to camera improvements and more, it looks like 2024 should be a good year for those who are ready to make the jump to a new iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone App Sideloading Coming to Users in the EU in First Half of 2024</h2><br/>
iPhone users in the EU next year will be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/eu-iphone-app-sideloading-coming-2024/">download apps hosted outside of Apple's official App Store</a> to comply with European regulations, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/federighi-sideloading.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-825519" /><br/>
Writing in the latest subscriber edition of his Power On newsletter, Gurman said Apple will introduce a "highly controlled system" that lets EU users install apps hosted elsewhere. Apple also will reportedly alter Messages and payment apps as part of the changes, likely via a localized iOS 17 update.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Black Friday Deals Available Now: AirPods, iPhone, iPad, and More</h2><br/>
We're less than a week away from Black Friday, but deals have been in full swing since October so we are firmly in holiday shopping season where you can get great deals across Apple products and accessories.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/best-early-black-friday-deals.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920468" /><br/>
We're <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-black-friday-deals-available-now/">keeping track of the best deals on Apple products and related accessories</a>, so be sure to check out our ongoing coverage throughout the rest of this month and into December.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AI-Infused iOS 18 Lauded as 'Ambitious and Compelling' by Apple Execs</h2><br/>
Apple internally believes its iOS 18, macOS 15, watchOS 11, and tvOS 18 updates next year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">will be "ambitious and compelling,"</a> thanks to major new software features and designs in the works. That's according to the latest information relayed by <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
While little is known about the specifics, many of the changes are believed to involve generative AI, including a smarter version of Siri that takes the virtual assistant's integration with the operating systems to a new level.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>watchOS 10.2 Beta Reintroduces Option to Change Apple Watch Faces With a Swipe</h2><br/>
As part of Apple's revamp of the Apple Watch interface with watchOS 10, the company did away with the ability to quickly change watch faces with a simple swipe.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-ultra-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913279" /><br/>
While some users were relieved to no longer find themselves accidentally changing faces, others have been upset that changing faces now requires multiple steps.<br/>
<br/>
With the latest watchOS 10.2 beta seeded this week, Apple is seeking to satisfy both groups, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/watchos-10-2-watch-face-swipe-change/">bringing back the swipe gesture to change watch faces</a> but making it an optional setting. watchOS 10.2 is expected to see a public release next month.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple made the first beta of iOS 17.2 available to developers in October. Since then we've seen two more betas, and with each iteration Apple continues to add more new features and changes, many of which users have been anticipating for quite a while. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-17.2-Everything-New-Your-iPhone-Can-Do-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922959" /><br/>
Below, we've listed 25 new things that are coming to your iPhone when the finalized version is publicly released in December.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>1. Help You Keep a Daily Journal</h2> <br/>
Your iPhone will soon be able to act as your personal journaling companion, thanks to Apple's new Journal app. Apple originally announced it was releasing a Journal app as part of iOS 17, and it's finally coming in iOS 17.2.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Journal-App-iOS-17-Feature-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2612" height="1469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918878" /><br/>
The Journal app has a simple, straightforward interface. When you open it up, you're presented with a "+" button, and tapping on it lets you start a new entry. Journal entries are automatically dated, and you can bookmark your favorite ones. Entries can include images, voice recordings, and location tags, so not only will you have the ability to create and maintain a daily journal, you'll be able to easily record your thoughts, experiences, and memories with your iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>2. Set a Journaling Schedule</h2> <br/>
Staying consistent with journaling can be difficult, but your iPhone can make it a lot easier with the new Journal app's scheduling feature, which can be found in Settings ➝ Journal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/journal-schedule.jpg" alt="journal" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922941" /><br/>
The scheduling option isn't just a reminder – it's about building a habit. So whether it's a gentle reminder notification that you need in the morning or a prompt before bed, you can adapt the feature to your personal routine.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>3. Offer Journaling Suggestions</h2> <br/>
When you first open the Journal app, you can decide what information it can pull from your phone for writing suggestions. Options include workout activity, media like podcasts and music, photos, and significant locations. You can control which apps and services appear using the switches in the Settings app under Privacy & Security ➝ Journaling Suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/journal-suggestions.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922984" /><br/>
Here, there are also settings to prefer suggestions with others when you're around your contacts or large groups, and to be discoverable by others to help prioritize the suggestions of other people. If you don't like suggestions in general, you can simply turn them off (Settings ➝ Journal ➝ Skip Journaling Suggestions).<br/>
<br/>
<h2>4. Give Journaling Prompts</h2> <br/>
If you have a serious case of writer's block, iOS 17.2 can offer you entry prompts in the form of "reflections." These reflections are designed to inspire and guide you, providing ideas and topics to explore in each entry.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/journal-prompts.jpg" alt="journal" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922986" /><br/>
The reflections can vary from thought-provoking questions to creative writing cues, and if the one you're offered doesn't get your gears turning, you can tap a button to generate a new one.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>5. Secure Your Journal</h2> <br/>
Privacy and security are paramount when it comes to personal journaling. That's why iOS 17.2 introduces enhanced security features, including encryption and password protection, to safeguard your journal from unauthorized access.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/journal-lock.jpg" alt="settings" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922990" /><br/>
The option can be found in the Settings app under Journal ➝ Lock Journal, and it allows you to use your device passcode, Face ID or Touch ID, providing peace of mind every time you record sensitive or personal information.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>6. Translate with a Button Press</h2> <br/>
Overcome communication barriers with the new custom Translation option for the Action button in iOS 17.2. With just a button press, your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max will be able to translate live conversations into multiple languages. The feature should be a boon for travelers, students, and anyone learning a language.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-Button-Translate.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911022" /><br/>
You can choose which language the speech should be translated into in the Translate app. According to Apple, the translation is not just accurate but also context-aware, ensuring that nuances and colloquialisms are captured effectively.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>7. Show Detailed Weather Forecasts on Home Screen</h2> <br/>
The update includes new Details, Daily Forecast, and Sunrise/Sunset widgets for the Weather widget, providing more of the kind of information that you would normally only find by going into the Weather app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/weather-app-widgets.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918889" /><br/>
Details shows information like precipitation chance, UV index, wind speed, and air quality, while Daily Forecast offers the weather for the next few days in a small widget size. Sunrise/Sunset naturally shows the sunrise and sunset times for each day.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>8. Host Collaborative Music Playlists</h2> <br/>
Collaborative playlists in the Music app let you create and share playlists with friends, family, or colleagues, enabling everyone to contribute their favorite tracks. It adds another social dimension to the Music app, and provides a useful way to discover new music and share your musical tastes with others.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="5484" height="3085" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918890" /><br/>
In a playlist you have made, just tap on the three-dot icon in the top right of the app, select the Collaborate option and choose Start Collaboration. You'll then be able to create a link to the playlist, and anyone who has access to that link can add to it. You can also invite people to join via QR code, and opt to approve each person that asks to join.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>9. Use Stickers as Message Reactions</h2> <br/>
Apple aims to make message reactions in the Messages app more fun and expressive by offering an easier way to use stickers as an alternative to tapback reactions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-tapback-reply-sticker.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918892" /><br/>
Previously you had to drag a sticker or an emoji from the keyboard onto any message bubble. Now you can simply long press on any chat bubble and tap "Add Sticker," which lets you choose either a sticker or an emoji to apply to the corner of an iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>10. Record Spatial Video</h2> <br/>
If you have an iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro Max, iOS 17.2 will allow you to record spatial video for viewing in the Photos app on Apple's forthcoming Vision Pro headset, set to be released in early 2024. (Note that when spatial videos captured with an ‌iPhone‌ are viewed on the ‌iPhone‌, they appear as normal videos.)<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-apple-visioin-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911687" /><br/>
To enable spatial video recording, go to Settings ➝ Camera ➝ Formats, then toggle on Spatial Video for Apple Vision Pro. Video is recorded at 30 frames per second at 1080p, and one minute of video takes up 130MB of storage space. Apple says that for best results when recording spatial video, the iPhone should be held stable in landscape orientation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>11. Populate a Favorites Music Playlist</h2> <br/>
Apple is introducing a Favorites Music Playlist in Apple Music that automatically aggregates any songs that you have favorited, ensuring that your most-liked tracks are always at your fingertips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-favorite-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918891" /><br/>
Since it populates dynamically, it should make it easier to enjoy the music you love while removing some of the hassle of manual curation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>12. Selectively Turn Off Your Listening History</h2> <br/>
There's a new privacy-centric feature that allows you to selectively turn off your listening history. This means that you can listen to music – or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-music-listening-history-focus-filter/">allow your kids to listen to their stuff on your device</a> – without influencing your future recommendations or shared playlists.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-music-listening-history-focus1.jpg" alt="focus" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920453" /><br/>
It's a useful tool for times when you're exploring new genres or playing music for others, since it ensures that your personal recommendations remain untainted by atypical listening choices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>13. Verify Your iMessage Contacts</h2> <br/>
The security of iMessage has been enhanced with a new feature to verify your contacts. Contact Key Verification adds an extra layer of trust and authenticity to your conversations by displaying a code that verifies you are communicating with the intended person.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/Apple-advanced-security-iMessage-Contact-Key-Verification_screen-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876653" /><br/>
Apple first previewed iMessage Contact Key Verification in December 2022, and said it is designed for those who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials. It should help in safeguarding against impersonation and phishing attempts, making iMessage and FaceTime more secure platforms for personal and professional communication.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>14. Sync Additional Message Settings in iCloud</h2> <br/>
iCloud's capabilities now include the synchronization of additional message settings across your Apple devices. A new "Messages in ‌iCloud‌" section in the Settings app shows the total amount of storage that messages are taking up, the number of messages synced to ‌iCloud‌, and the time of the last sync. There's also a "Sync Now" option to force an update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-messages-in-icloud.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918896" /><br/>
Preferences and customizations made in the Messages app on one device will automatically reflect on your other devices signed in to the same iCloud account. Apple previously said that additional settings would be synced through Messages in ‌iCloud‌ in ‌iOS 17‌, like Text Message Forwarding, Send & Receive accounts, and SMS filters across devices, so those additional settings are likely to sync, too.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>15. A New TV App Experience</h2><br/>
Apple is revamping the TV app in iOS 17.2, offering a refreshed and more user-friendly experience. The update focuses on improving navigation and discoverability, making it easier to find your favorite shows and movies.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-tv-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918905" /><br/>
Apple has removed the separate tabs for Movies and TV shows in the Store section of the Apple TV app, with everything now integrated together. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has said that Apple also plans to remove the option to purchase TV shows and movies from the iTunes app as part of a TV app redesign.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>16. Improve Reliability of Emergency Alerts</h2><br/>
Apple has improved the reliability of emergency alerts on iPhone. In Settings -> Notifications & Emergency Alerts, there is a new "Local Awareness" option that can be turned on. Apple says that Local Awareness uses your approximate location to improve the timeliness, accuracy, and reliability of emergency alerts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-emergency-local-awareness.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918902" /><br/>
Whether it's severe weather warnings, Amber alerts, or other vital notifications, this setting should increase the probability that important alerts are not missed due to technical issues.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>17. Add More Color to Contact Posters</h2> <br/>
Add a splash of color to your Contact Poster, with a new rainbow-colored text option for your name, allowing you to make it more vibrant and visually appealing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-contact-poster-rainbow.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918893" /><br/>
If you want your Contact Poster to stand out from the contacts crowd, this provides another way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>18. Make Your iPhone an AirPlay Receiver</h2> <br/>
The iOS 17.2 update will turn your iPhone into an AirPlay receiver ready for the spatial computing era. A new "AirPlay Receiver" setting allows the upcoming ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ headset to stream or share content to your ‌iPhone‌.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-airplay-handoff.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918898" /><br/>
Earlier this year, Apple said AirPlay‌ would soon work with supported televisions in hotels, allowing users to easily enjoy their favorite content on the TV when traveling. Apple said the capability will be available before the end of the year in select hotels, and it looks as if iOS 17.2 could also be the update that makes it happen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>19. Add More Memoji Customizations</h2> <br/>
The update brings enhanced customization options for Memoji, allowing users to create avatars that are more representative of their personal style and identity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-memoji-body.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918895" /><br/>
To that end, Apple has added a "Body" section for Memoji where users can customize waist, bust, shoulders, and arms.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>20. Rolling News Event Updates in Real Time</h2> <br/>
The News app now delivers events in real-time with added support for Live Activities, keeping users informed with up-to-the-minute updates on news-related events such as elections.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-apple-news-live-activities.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918899" /><br/>
Live Activities allow iPhone users to stay on top of real-time events right on the Lock Screen on any iPhone model compatible with iOS 17, and in the Dynamic Island on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>21. Stop Adding Favorited Songs to Your Library</h2> <br/>
A new option included in the update enables you to stop favorited songs (and in many cases whole albums) from being automatically added to your music library. It gives you more control over your music collection by ensuring that only the songs you choose to add are saved.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-2-music-add-favorite-songs.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922545" /><br/>
The new toggle can be found in Settings ➝ Music ➝ Add Favorite Songs. If you turn the option off, don't worry – favorited songs will still populate the new Favorites playlist. The option to "Favorite" songs was added in iOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>22. Disable Inline Predictions</h2> <br/>
It's now possible to disable inline predictions when you're entering text into your iPhone. The new "Show Predictions Inline" toggle, found in Settings ➝ General ➝ Keyboard, is likely to be welcomed by those who prefer a more manual typing experience or find inline autocomplete text suggestions distracting.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/keyboard-inline-predictions.jpg" alt="" width="1808" height="1017" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922546" /><br/>
The additional toggle also means that you can now turn off inline text predictions without disabling the predictive text that appears above the onscreen keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>23. FaceTime Blocked Contact Warnings</h2> <br/>
iOS 17.2 enhances privacy in FaceTime by introducing warnings for blocked contacts. If a blocked contact tries to reach you via FaceTime, the app now provides a notification, giving you awareness and control over the communication before the call is initiated.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/General-Apps-FaceTime.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-832602" /><br/>
Apple provides warnings when joining a call with a blocked contact, or when a blocked contact is joining a call you're already on.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>24. Share Your Contact Poster in FaceTime</h2> <br/>
The update adds new options for sharing your Contact Poster through FaceTime and Phone. Previously, the setting was only available for the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/phone-share-photo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922547" /><br/>
In the settings pages for both apps, "Share Name and Photo" can be toggled off, set to Contacts Only, or set to Always Ask, which prompts you before sharing that information with others.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>25. Expand Sensitive Content Warnings</h2> <br/>
Lastly, Apple's opt-in Sensitive Content Warning feature will work with Contact Posters in both the Contacts and Phone apps, as well as stickers in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Sensitive-Content-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922023" /><br/>
When turned on, the Sensitive Content Warning feature uses on-device machine learning to analyze photos and videos, and blurs photos or videos with any detected nudity before users view them. Apple says it does not receive any indication that nudity was detected, and does not gain access to the photos or videos as a result.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/new-iphone-features-december-ios-update/">25 New Things Your iPhone Can Do With Next Month&#039;s iOS 17.2 Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/25-new-things-your-iphone-can-do-with-next-months-ios-17-2-update.2411302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is pausing all of its advertising on social network X, formerly known as Twitter, reports <em><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/17/apple-twitter-x-advertising-elon-musk-antisemitism-ads">Axios</a></em>. The decision comes following antisemitic remarks that Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1724908287471272299">made on Wednesday</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/X-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904140" /><br/>
After advertisers fled from X after Musk's takeover of the social network, Apple continued to pay for ad spots, and has been one of the Twitter's largest ad partners. Back in March, Musk <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/03/elon-musk-thanks-apple-disney-advertising-on-twitter-whic-would-have-gone-bankrupt-without-him-1235282055/">thanked Apple</a> for its support, calling the company one of Twitter's "biggest advertisers."<br/>
<br/>
Apple did <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/28/elon-musk-apple-stopped-twitter-ads/">temporarily pause ads</a> on Twitter back in November 2022, which spurred Musk to lash out and ask if Apple hated "free speech." Musk also said that Apple had threatened to remove Twitter from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, and said that he would "make an alternative phone" if the social network was ultimately pulled.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/30/elon-musk-tim-cook-meeting-apple-park/">dispute was resolved</a> after Musk met with Cook at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> later that year, after which Musk claimed that Apple had in fact never threatened to remove Twitter from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and that it was a "misunderstanding." Musk ultimately called it a "good conversation," and after that point, Apple "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/03/apple-resumes-twitter-advertising/">fully resumed</a>" advertising. Reports in 2022 suggested Apple was spending more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-28/musk-says-that-apple-has-mostly-stopped-advertising-on-twitter">&#36;100 million per year</a> on Twitter ads.<br/>
<br/>
With Musk's latest comments, and evidence that X is <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle">showing Apple ads</a> alongside pro-Hitler content, it is unclear if Apple will be convinced to resume advertising again sometime in the future. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/18/tim-cook-says-apple-constantly-weighing-advertising-on-elon-musks-x.html">in September said</a> that Apple is "constantly" evaluating whether Apple should be buying ads on the social network.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is not the only company pulling out of Twitter ads. IBM <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-x-antisemitism-twitter-ads-83e68f03e9bf1d261c1a8c55066c4e59">said this week</a> that it is pulling ads, and the European Union also no longer plans to advertise on the social network. The White House earlier today <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/17/white-house-blasts-elon-musk-for-promoting-antisemitic-racist-hate.html">condemned Musk's comments</a>, and X employees told <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/technology/elon-musk-endorses-antisemitic-post-ibm.html">The New York Times</a></em> that it has been fielding calls from other companies upset with Musk.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/">Apple Pausing Advertising on X Following Latest Elon Musk Controversy</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pausing-advertising-on-x-following-latest-elon-musk-controversy.2411296/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even though there's still one week until Black Friday, we're tracking a number of all-time low prices on iPads today. This also includes record lows on iPad accessories like the Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ipad-red.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923016" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

<br/>
<h2>iPads</h2><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the 9th generation iPad, Amazon has the 64GB Wi-Fi model for &#36;249.00, down from &#36;329.00. This is a match of the best price we've ever tracked on this iPad, and it's a great entry-level option for kids or family members who don't need a tablet for intensive tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9FPHY6%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;80 OFF</div>10.2-inch iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;249.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Amazon also has the 10th generation iPad at an all-time low price, and this one is a new deal for Black Friday 2023. The 64GB Wi-Fi model has hit &#36;349.00, down from &#36;449.00, which is &#36;50 below the typical price we've been tracking all year.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLCL22Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>10.9-inch iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;349.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Switching to the iPad Air, Amazon is discounting the 2022 64GB Wi-Fi tablet to &#36;499.99, down from &#36;599.00. It's another best-ever price, and it's one of many iPad Air deals that have appeared for Black Friday. You can also find cellular markdowns on Amazon right now.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3JH3XS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;99 OFF</div>iPad Air (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;499.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ios-18s-major-new-ai-features/id1602394741?i=1000635198080">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss the widely rumored array of AI features heading for iOS 18 and Apple's other major software updates in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NeOs-iR03Fo?si=F3CRMstGZU0sahiI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Supply chain checks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">suggest</a> that Apple is building servers to deliver cloud-based AI in late 2024, as well as locally-processed "edge-AI." The company is reportedly planning to debut a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">"smarter" version of Siri</a> based on its own large language model (LLM) next year that can understand complex questions and auto-complete sentences more effectively, as well as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">integrate with the Shortcuts app</a> for complex multi-step tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be working on adding AI to as many apps as possible, including features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, such as auto-generated playlists, and productivity apps like Pages and Keynote, where AI could assist with writing or creating slide decks. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup is also rumored to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">exclusive AI capabilities</a>, and the company is even rumored to be looking into how generative AI could be used to aid <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've <a href="https://www.colorware.com/">teamed up with ColorWare</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a set of <a href="https://www.colorware.com/p-1405-airpods-pro-2nd-gen-usb-c.aspx?c=variant-142*l02-9ngo*l03-9nit*l04-9njs">custom-painted second-generation AirPods Pro with a USB-C port</a>. Apple in September discontinued the Lightning-based version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 and instead swapped over to USB-C, and ColorWare is already able to make them in unique colors<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923022" /><br/>
ColorWare has been offering custom-painted Apple products and accessories for more than two decades now, and this is <em>the</em> company to go with if you want AirPods or Apple devices in shades that are less boring than Apple's default colors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923023" /><br/>
All of ColorWare's products come in hundreds of unique color combinations, and it customizes AirPods, &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>, Magic Mouse, and accessories like consoles and controllers from companies like Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923025" /><br/>
Custom <a href="https://www.colorware.com/p-1405-airpods-pro-2nd-gen-usb-c.aspx?c=variant-142*l02-9ngo*l03-9nit*l04-9njs">second-generation AirPods Pro 2 with a USB-C port</a> are available from ColorWare for &#36;439, a price that includes colorization for both of the AirPods and the accompanying USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> Charging Case. If you just want to customize the earbuds, that can be done for &#36;389.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-5.jpg" alt="" width="1999" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923026" /><br/>
There's a premium price tag for ordering from ColorWare, but with &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 only available in white, this is the sole way to get AirPods in black, red, blue, orange, or dozens of other colors. With the holidays coming up, custom AirPods are a unique gift you won't find elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-6.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923027" /><br/>
ColorWare also has a multi-step coating process that includes a primer, the application of a proprietary color formula, and an X2 liquid plastic coating that protects the color. Custom painting is guaranteed for 12 months.<br/>
<br/>
You can get both solid and metallic paint options from ColorWare, along with gloss and matte finishes depending on personal preference. There are traditional silver, gray, and gold colors that match Apple devices, but colors in every shade of the rainbow are available too.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-7.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923028" /><br/>
Each AirPod can be painted the same color as the case, or you can get the case and the earbuds all in different colors, which leads to thousands of color combinations to chose from.<br/>
<br/>
ColorWare even offers custom colors <a href="https://www.colorware.com/p-1419-colorware-cowpods-pro-pink.aspx?c=variant-14h">like the "CowPods Pro"</a> that features a case with a cow print, or the <a href="https://www.colorware.com/p-1418-colorware-airpods-pro-2nd-gen-supernova.aspx?c=variant-14g">black holographic Supernova set</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-2.jpg" alt="" width="1999" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923024" /><br/>
To create its custom accessories, ColorWare uses standard second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; with USB-C case directly from Apple, which means the full AirPods functionality is intact.<br/>
<br/>
