		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models</a> are equipped with OLED displays that support a refresh rate as low as 10Hz, but the devices still lack an always-on display option like the iPhone and Apple Watch have, according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/specs/">Apple's tech specs</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/f-7ba5b5b668dd68b7179a599305cff6b117ef35d1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="901" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949425" /><br/>
While the iPad Pro has supported ProMotion since 2017, the device only supported refresh rates between 24Hz and 120Hz until now. The new iPad Pro models use low-power LTPO technology, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1787890275656024118">display industry expert Ross Young</a>, allowing the display to ramp down to 10Hz for static content. This change will contribute to lower power consumption, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/2024-ipad-battery-life/">advertised battery life is unchanged</a> overall compared to the previous iPad Pro generation.<br/>
<br/>
The same situation happened a few years ago with the iPhone 13 Pro models, which also support ProMotion down to 10Hz, but lack an always-on display option. The feature finally arrived on the iPhone with the iPhone 14 Pro models, which can ramp down to 1Hz, and Apple Watch models with an always-on display also reach 1Hz.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, the iPad Pro is unlikely to get an always-on display option until if and when it too supports a 1Hz refresh rate.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the iPad Pro now features "state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology that uses two OLED panels and combines the light from both to provide phenomenal full-screen brightness." The new iPad Pro models can achieve up to 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR content, compared to 600 nits for the previous-generation models.<br/>
<br/>
The new iPad Pro models are available to order starting today and launch on Wednesday, May 15.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/promotion/">ProMotion</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/new-ipad-pro-still-lacks-always-on-display/">New iPad Pros Support Lower Refresh Rate, But Lack Always-On Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pros-support-lower-refresh-rate-but-lack-always-on-display.2425689/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple now offers four different <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> models at &#36;79, &#36;99, and &#36;129 price points, each with different feature sets and compatibility. Our guide helps you decide which &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is best for you.<br/>
<br/>

Which &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; you should buy is firstly determined by which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> model you have. Some &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models are only compatible with one kind of &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, while others are compatible with two. If your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; model only supports one kind of &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, your buying decision is straightforward. Use the table below to find out which &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; supports:<br/>
<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Simply put, if your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; features a Lightning connector, it is only compatible with the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, providing it has &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support at all. It will not work with the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; or the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C. If your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; features a USB-C port, it is compatible with the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C, except the tenth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, which supports the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, which support the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is only compatible with the tenth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; using a USB-C cable and USB-C to &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Adapter. It is not possible to use the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; this way with any other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; model that has a USB-C port.<br/>
<br/>
All four &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models feature "pixel-perfect" precision, low latency, and tilt sensitivity, but feature different designs, pairing and charging methods, pressure sensitivity capabilities, and more. The below table lists all hardware and feature differences between the different &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models.<br/>

<br/>
<h3 id="first-generation_apple_pencil_vs._apple_pencil_with_usb-c">First-Generation Apple Pencil vs. Apple Pencil With USB-C</h3><br/>
Most users should choose the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C. For a price of just &#36;79, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C provides a good balance of features with a more modern design. It also has the added advantage of being compatible with a wide range of models and will likely work with all new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models for many years to come.<br/>
<br/>
It is only worth opting for the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; if you specifically want pressure-sensitivity for activities like illustration, since the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C does not have this feature. Buyers should be aware that this model comes at a &#36;20 premium, requires a USB-C to &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Adapter with the tenth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and will not be compatible with any future &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models. It also cannot be magnetically attached to an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for storage, features a larger and older design, and has a removable cap over the Lightning connector that's easy to lose.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="second-generation_apple_pencil_or_apple_pencil_pro_vs._apple_pencil_with_usb-c">Second-Generation Apple Pencil or Apple Pencil Pro vs. Apple Pencil With USB-C</h3><br/>
If choosing between the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; or &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro and the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C, the second-generation and Pro models are a better choice on account of their superior feature set, but this requires spending an additional &#36;50. Double-tap to change tools and pressure-sensitivity may be particularly useful additions for illustrators, while the easy pairing and charging on the side of an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; provides a much better experience than a wired connection with a USB-C cable.<br/>

If you have only basic needs for activities like handwriting notes and marking up documents, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C is still a great option at a much more affordable price point. It even supports &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover on the newer &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil-buyers-guide/">Apple Pencil Buyer&#039;s Guide: Which Model Should You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-buyers-guide-which-model-should-you-choose.2407987/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/final-cut-pro-transforms-video-creation-with-live-multicam-on-ipad-and-new-ai-features-on-mac/">today introduced</a> a new version of the Final Cut Pro software that's designed to run on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, introducing capabilities designed specifically for the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/final-cut-pro-ipad.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949711" /><br/>
A new Live Multicam feature allows users to capture up to four different angles of a single scene using connected iPhones and iPads. To make this feature work, Apple has created a Final Cut Camera app that captures video from each of the devices and feeds it into Final Cut Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Users can get a director's view of each camera in real time, and the settings can be adjusted from the Final Cut Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 2 app. There are options for tweaking exposure, focus, white balance, ISO, shutter speed, and zoom to get the perfect shots. Preview clips are passed through to Final Cut Pro and then replaced with full-resolution files so users can quickly move from production to editing.<br/>
<br/>
Final Cut Camera is available as a standalone app and in addition to feeding footage to Final Cut Pro, it can be used as a video capture app for recording video with precise manual controls.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/final-cut-camera.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949712" /><br/>
The updated Final Cut Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app supports external projects, so users can create or open projects on an external device and import media without taking up &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; storage space.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added additional customization options to Final Cut Pro, including 12 color-grading presets, eight basic text titles, 20 soundtracks, and new dynamic backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
With the M4 chip, final rendering with Final Cut Pro is up to 2x faster, and it supports up to 4x more streams of ProRes RAW than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. Final Cut for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, adding support for barrel roll and squeeze, improving access to and control over tools.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also updated Final Cut Pro for the Mac, adding Enhance Light and Color, an AI feature that improves color, color balance, contrast, and brightness in one step. Smooth Slo-Mo, another new feature, blends frames of video intelligently to provide higher-quality movement.<br/>
<br/>
Final Cut Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 2 will be available this spring as a free update for existing users, with new users able to purchase it for &#36;4.99 per month or &#36;49 per year. Final Cut Camera will come later in the spring as well, and Final Cut Pro for Mac 10.8 will be available as a free update for existing users.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/final-cut-pro-ipad-2/">Apple Debuts New Final Cut Pro for iPad and Final Cut Camera App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-debuts-new-final-cut-pro-for-ipad-and-final-cut-camera-app.2425687/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models that Apple introduced today continue to offer the same 10 hours of battery life that Apple has advertised with iPads for years now, despite the addition of new, more efficient chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-iPad-Air-and-iPad-Pro-11-inch-and-13-inch-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949648" /><br/>
Apple's &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has an M4 chip that is built on second-generation 3-nanometer technology, and it has six efficiency cores, or two more than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>. The device is also equipped with a more efficient OLED display, but neither the chip nor the OLED display have resulted in additional battery life. <br/>
<br/>
The 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has a 31.29-watt-hour battery, up from 28.65‐watt‐hours in the prior-generation model, while the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has a 38.99-watt-hour battery, down from 40.88-watt-hours.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, the 11-inch model has a 28.93‐watt‐hour, up slightly from the 28.6-watt-hour battery that was in the prior 10.9-inch version. The new 13-inch model has a 36.59‐watt‐hour battery.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models last for up to 10 hours when surfing the web on Wi-Fi or watching video, but that drops to nine hours when surfing the web using a cellular data network.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/2024-ipad-battery-life/">New 2024 iPads Still Have 10 Hours of Battery Life</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-2024-ipads-still-have-10-hours-of-battery-life.2425678/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> Airs arrive almost a year and a half after the previous models, offering almost 20 changes and upgrades. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/2022-iPad-Air-vs-2024-iPad-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949668" /><br/>
The 2022 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> was a minor upgrade that added features such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip and a 12MP Ultra Wide front-facing camera with Center Stage. The 2024 refresh is more substantial, headlining with a larger size option for the first time, bringing it in line with devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and MacBook Pro, which are available in two sizes.<br/>
<br/>
The ‌2022 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models have now been discontinued by Apple, but they may still be found refurbished and with third-party resellers for lower prices. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to buy the 2022 ‌&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; or the new 2024 models.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Airs from 2022 and 2024 share most of their key features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the older model to save money? This breakdown also serves as a way to clearly see all the differences that the new ‌&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; brings to the table.<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The most important part of the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is the larger display size option, which provides a way for customers who don't need features like ProMotion and a LiDAR scanner to obtain a bigger screen that's better for productivity and content consumption at a lower price point. Beyond this larger new model, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro support, and landscape front-facing camera are valuable improvements. That being said, it is certainly not essential to upgrade from the previous model to the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Unless you have an entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or an &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; from before 2020, or explicitly want a 13-inch model, it is likely not worth upgrading.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-air-2022-vs-2024/">iPad Air 2022 vs. iPad Air 2024 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 19 Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-2022-vs-ipad-air-2024-buyers-guide-19-differences-compared.2425676/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are two notable design changes for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">new iPad Pro models</a> introduced today: they are the thinnest Apple products ever released, and they are available in a new Space Black finish that debuted on the MacBook Pro last year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-Space-Black.jpeg" alt="" width="1250" height="750" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949627" /><br/>
Apple gave the media some hands-on time with the new iPad Pro models, and we have rounded up real-world photos and videos of the devices below.<br/>
<br/>
The new 11-inch iPad Pro is just 5.3mm thick, and the 13-inch model is even thinner at 5.1mm.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-magic-keyboard-ipad-pro/">new Magic Keyboard</a> for the new iPad Pro models that features an aluminum palm rest and a larger trackpad. The keyboard is available in Black and White color options, which have Space Black and Silver palm rests, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Last, the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-pencil-pro-announced/">Apple Pencil Pro</a> looks very similar to the second-generation Apple Pencil.<br/>

An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta. Apple has also released an RC version of iOS 16.7.8 for devices that are unable to run &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the features that Apple promised would be coming in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; have now been released, but iOS 17.5 adds additional app ecosystem changes in the European Union. App developers can offer apps for download on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/ios-17-5-app-web-downloads-eu/">directly from their websites</a>, in addition to through app marketplaces.<br/>

The &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models come almost a year and a half after their predecessors, offering 25 significant changes and upgrades. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-2022-vs-2024-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949700" /><br/>
The 2022 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was a minor upgrade that added the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> hover, as well as support for Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and Smart HDR 4. The 2024 refresh is much more substantial, with more than two dozen changes and generation-over-generation improvements.<br/>
<br/>
The ‌2022 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ models have now been discontinued by Apple, but they may still be found refurbished and with third-party resellers for lower prices. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to buy the 2022 ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ or the new 2024 models.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> Pros from 2022 and 2024 share many of their key features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the older model to save money? This breakdown also serves as a way to clearly see all the differences that the new ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ brings to the table.<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Overall, the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is an unusually significant upgrade over the previous generation, offering a large number of improvements that meaningfully improve the hardware experience with the device. The move to a high-end OLED display, thinner and lighter design, Adaptive True Tone flash, and landscape 12MP Ultra Wide front-facing camera are noticeable improvements that almost all users will benefit from. Features like the M4 chip, nano-texture display option, and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro support have the potential to enhance specific tasks and processes with the device, which could be particularly important to the likes of content creators and digital artists.<br/>
<br/>
However, it is important to note that the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; does not have any software advantages over previous versions of the device. Upgrading to the latest model is unlikely to dramatically change workflows, but it should offer a better overall experience. Users with an older &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, such as a 2018 model or older, have considerably more to gain by upgrading. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-pro-2022-vs-2024/">iPad Pro 2022 vs. iPad Pro 2024 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 25 Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-2022-vs-ipad-pro-2024-buyers-guide-25-differences-compared.2425663/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.5 update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, watchOS 10.5 can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, the update includes support for the new Pride watch face.<blockquote>watchOS 10.5 includes new features, improvements and bug fixes, including a new Pride Radiance watch face to honor the LGBTQ+ community and culture.<br/>
<br/>
For information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222</blockquote>The final version of watchOS 10.5 is likely to see a release next week.<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/apple-tv-4k-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856182" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.5 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">iPad Pro was updated with the M4 chip and more</a> today, the latest 11-inch and 13-inch models lack two features that are available on some previous models, including mmWave 5G support and an Ultra Wide camera.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-M4-Silver-and-Space-Black-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949554" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/">Apple's comparison page</a> confirms that cellular configurations of the new iPad Pro models are limited to sub-6GHz bands for 5G. mmWave 5G was supported on the previous two iPad Pro generations, but in the U.S. only and never elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to explain why it removed mmWave support from the iPad Pro. mmWave is a set of 5G frequencies that can provide very fast speeds at short distances, which is ideal for dense urban areas. By comparison, sub-6GHz 5G is generally slower than mmWave, but the signals travel further, better serving suburban and rural areas.<br/>
<br/>
The 10-megapixel Ultra Wide rear camera on the last three iPad Pro generations is also absent on the latest models, which only have a 12-megapixel Wide rear camera.<br/>
<br/>
As we previously noted, cellular configurations of the latest iPad Pro and iPad Air models also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/2024-ipad-air-ipad-pro-no-sim-slot/">lack a physical SIM card slot</a>, making them eSIM-only devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/new-ipad-pro-lacks-mmwave-5g-and-ultra-wide-camera/">New iPad Pro Lacks mmWave 5G and Ultra-Wide Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pro-lacks-mmwave-5g-and-ultra-wide-camera.2425651/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of the refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, Apple introduced a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro." No &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; options have been discontinued, which means there are now four total Apple Pencils to choose from.<br/>
<br/>

While the updated &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; are compatible with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro and the USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, they do not work with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2. Older iPads are also not able to work with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple at its "Let Loose" event today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-event-live-blog-may-2024/">announced</a> new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, and there are smaller changes compared to the previous generation devices that did not get mentioned during the event but are worth knowing about. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/https-images.macrumors.comarticle-new202112iphone-12-sim-card-slot-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-831090" /><br/>
One of the differences worth noting is the lack of a physical SIM card slot. On the previous generation models, the cellular versions of both the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; included a physical SIM card slot. In the new devices, that's no longer the case. All cellular models now support eSIM only.<br/>
<br/>
It's a small but crucial detail for anyone looking to upgrade their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> while sticking with their current cellular plan. Apple has not divulged the reason why it chose to remove the physical SIM slot, but it could have been a design decision related to making the devices slimmer, or a necessity to keep them slim, given all of the devices' hardware upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, the change brings parity to Apple's latest &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models and its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, which dropped the physical SIM slot in 2022 with the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/2024-ipad-air-ipad-pro-no-sim-slot/">Apple&#039;s New Cellular iPad Air and iPad Pro Models Are eSIM Only</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-cellular-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-models-are-esim-only.2425644/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced ultra thin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, which are the thinnest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models to date. In fact, Apple is using the tagline "thinpossible" to describe the new tablets, and with that reduction in thickness, there's also been a reduction in weight.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipad-pro-thin-light.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949512" /><br/>
Both &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, despite the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models having the "Air" name that has historically been used to denote a light weight and a thin design when compared to Pro devices.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>13-inch iPad Pro</strong> - 1.28 pounds (579 grams)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>13-inch iPad Air</strong> - 1.36 pounds (617 grams)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro</strong> - 0.98 pounds (444 grams)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>11-inch iPad Air</strong> - 1.02 pounds (462 grams)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is 5.3mm thick, while the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is 5.1mm thick, which Apple pointed out is thinner than the iPod nano. Both &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models are 6.1mm thick, comparatively, and they have noticeably thicker bezels.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; pricing starts at &#36;599, while &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; pricing starts at &#36;999.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/ipad-pro-ipad-air-weight/">Apple&#039;s New iPad Pro Models Weigh Less Than iPad Air Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-ipad-pro-models-weigh-less-than-ipad-air-models.2425638/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
The cost breakdown for the top-specification <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> is as follows:<br/>

<br/>
The maxed-out &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; costs &#36;2,599, but with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro and the Magic Keyboard for &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, it comes to a total of &#36;3,077 – a new high for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/fully-loaded-ipad-pro-costs-over-3000/">New iPad Pro With All Options Costs Over &#36;3,000</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pro-with-all-options-costs-over-3-000.2425634/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
