		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a handful of Apple accessory discounts on Amazon, including all-time low prices for both the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">Apple Pencil Pro</a> and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">AirTag 4-Pack</a>. Neither deal requires a coupon code this time around, as both have been applied automatically by Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/airtag-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940079" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the AirTag 4-Pack, you can get this accessory for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;64.49</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00. This is an all-time low price, and you can find the 1-Pack on sale as well on Amazon, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CWXNS552%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;22.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;29.00.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;34 OFF</div>AirTag 4-Pack for &#36;64.49</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Secondly, Amazon has the Apple Pencil Pro for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;99.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00. This is a match for the record low price on the Apple Pencil Pro, and it's a deal that doesn't typically stick around long on Amazon, so if you've been waiting for it to return, be sure to check it out soon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-pencil-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956589" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;30 OFF</div>Apple Pencil Pro for &#36;99.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Money can buy an ultra-fast Mac, but it cannot buy ultra-fast delivery, apparently.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Mac-Studio-2025.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993134" /><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">new Mac Studio</a> with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chip options began arriving to customers today, but the highest-end model is facing delays.<br/>
<br/>
If you order a maxed-out Mac Studio with a 32-core M3 Ultra chip, 512GB of unified RAM, and 16TB of SSD storage on Apple's online store today, the mind-boggling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/maxed-out-m3-ultra-mac-studio-14099/">&#36;14,099 configuration</a> will not arrive until late March. Unsurprisingly, it is the massive 512GB of RAM upgrade option that seems to be causing the longer wait here.<br/>
<br/>
If ordered today, that configuration is estimated for delivery between March 26 and March 31, so there is currently a two- to three-week wait.<br/>
<br/>

		<title>What to Expect From Apple&#039;s Studio Display 2</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to release a new Studio Display in late 2025 or early 2026, <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1890099697811091590">according to Ross Young</a>, a display industry expert and VP at Counterpoint Research.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/studio-display-new-purple.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991273" /><br/>
In a subscriber-only post shared on X last month, Young said the new Studio Display will feature the same 27-inch screen size as the current model, but add mini-LED backlighting. This upgrade would result in increased brightness and higher contrast ratio compared to the current model, which has traditional LED backlighting.<br/>
<br/>
Young did not share any further details, so it is unclear if any other Studio Display specifications would change, such as the refresh rate.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the Studio Display in March 2022, alongside the first Mac Studio. The standalone display features a 27-inch LCD screen with a 5K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, up to 600 nits brightness, a built-in camera and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., the monitor starts at &#36;1,599.<br/>
<br/>
In November 2024, an anonymous listener of the Relay FM tech podcast "Upgrade" claimed that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/apple-working-on-90hz-studio-display-imac-ipad-air/">developing 90Hz display technology</a> that could be used for the next Studio Display. This higher refresh rate would make content like videos and text while scrolling look smoother to the eye, but 90Hz would stop short of the 120Hz refresh rate that iPhones and Macs with ProMotion support can achieve. It is not clear to us if this individual has any established track record with Apple-related rumors, so keep that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
A new Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting has been rumored by a few other sources, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-still-planned/">Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/new-studio-display-per-mark-gurman/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The display will likely launch in 2026, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
Young has a pretty good track record with display-related information for future Apple products. For example, he was the first source to reveal the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">would feature 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, respectively, over a year before the devices launched. He is the founder and former CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants, a research firm that was acquired by Counterpoint Research in late 2023.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/studio-display-2-key-new-feature/">What to Expect From Apple&#039;s Studio Display 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-studio-display-2.2452915/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<h2>13-Inch M4 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Starting with the 13-inch models, Amazon has &#36;50 off all three of the new configurations of this notebook. Prices start at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZD9S5GC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;949.00</strong></a> for the 256GB model, then raise to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZD96R5S%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,149.00</strong></a> for the 16GB/256GB model and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZD9XBK7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,349.00</strong></a> for the 24GB/512GB model. <a href="https://howl.link/mrcn2qfxkybys">Best Buy is matching</a> these deals for members.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>15-Inch M4 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Moving to the larger display models, Amazon has both 512GB versions of the 15-inch M4 MacBook Air on sale for launch day. The 16GB/512GB model is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZD9VLQ4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,349.00</strong></a> and the 24GB/512GB model is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZDCDJ21%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,549.00</strong></a>, both &#36;50 discounts.<br/>

<br/>
The only new M4 MacBook Air that Amazon does not have a discount for is the 256GB 15-inch MacBook Air, so if that's the one you're shopping for you'll need to look at Best Buy. At that retailer, My Best Buy Plus/Total members can get the computer for <a href="https://howl.link/m08el6jtnzwcf"><strong>&#36;1,149.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,199.00.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple continues to inform customers that a more personalized version of Siri has been delayed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Siri-Personal-Context.png" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955889" /><br/>
As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/12/apple-adds-new-disclaimer-on-its-website-advertising-delayed-ai-siri-features/">noted by <em>9to5Mac</em></a> today, Apple has added the following disclosure to all of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16/">iPhone 16 product pages</a> on its website:<blockquote>Siri's personal context understanding, onscreen awareness, and in-app actions are in development and will be available with a future software update.</blockquote>The overall <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence page</a> has gained similar fine print below each delayed Siri feature:<blockquote>This feature is in development and will be available with a future software update.</blockquote>We previously reported that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/apple-removes-siri-personal-context-reference/">removed references to the personalized Siri entirely</a> in some spots on its website, for now. And on its YouTube channel, Apple recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-pulls-iphone-16-ad-more-personal-siri/">hid an iPhone 16 Pro ad</a> in which actress Bella Ramsey demonstrated a personalized Siri feature.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement last week, Apple confirmed that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">needed more time to finish developing the new Siri features</a>. Apple said it aimed to begin rolling out the features "in the coming year," but it did not provide a more specific timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's full statement:<blockquote>Siri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we've made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT. We've also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.</blockquote>Our best guess is that the personalized Siri will launch at some point between iOS 19 in September 2025 and iOS 19.4 in March 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever they launch, the Siri upgrades will include understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, during its WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.<br/>
<br/>
The new capabilities will be powered by Apple Intelligence, so you will need an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, or any of the iPhone 17 models coming later this year.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/apple-website-siri-features-fine-print/">Apple Adds Disclosure About Delayed Siri Features to iPhone 16 Pages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-disclosure-about-delayed-siri-features-to-iphone-16-pages.2452906/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/apple-seeds-ios-18-4-public-beta-3/">iOS 18.4 update</a> for the iPhone includes a smaller but meaningful improvement for Apple's in-car iPhone mirroring system CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-carplay.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991400" /><br/>
Specifically, CarPlay now shows a third row of icons, up from two rows previously. However, this change is only visible in vehicles with a larger center display. For example, a MacRumors Forums member <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-beta-1-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2449908/post-33753569">noticed the change</a> in a Toyota Tundra with a 14-inch screen.<br/>
<br/>
In our testing, CarPlay still showed two rows of four icons in a Honda Civic with a 9-inch screen.<br/>
<br/>
While this is only a minor change, CarPlay showing more icons when possible is a nice quality-of-life improvement, allowing drivers to quickly access more apps with less swiping between pages and keep their eyes on the road.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4 is currently in beta testing. The software update will be released to the general public in early April, according to Apple's website.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the Apple Maps electric vehicle routing feature on CarPlay <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ford-apple-maps-ev-routing-nacs/">gained support for the North American Charging System (NACS)</a> charging connector standard this week. Ford recently began selling an adapter that allows its Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning vehicles to be charged by a Tesla Supercharger, and now the Apple Maps electric vehicle routing feature can plan routes that include stops at Tesla Superchargers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ford-nacs-ev-routing.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994179" /><br/>
Ford says this capability is available now on CarPlay with an iPhone running iOS 17 or later, so no new software update is required.<br/>
<br/>
Here are Ford's instructions on how to use the feature:<blockquote>- Connect your Apple iPhone to CarPlay.<br/>
- Open Apple Maps, go to Settings and confirm your preferred charging network(s) – make sure you select a NACS fast charging station, such as Tesla Supercharger. You only have to do this once.<br/>
- Enter a destination.<br/>
- Apple Maps will then calculate the estimated state of charge you will have when you get to a destination.<br/>
- If a charge is required, depending on the fastest route, it will automatically route you to a NACS fast charging station.*<br/>
<br/>
* When a route is started that includes Tesla Superchargers, drivers may see a warning that the route requires a Fast Charging Adapter (NACS) – drivers should make sure to have it with them to use. Battery preconditioning when enroute to a charger is not available for Apple Maps EV Routing.</blockquote>Looking further ahead into the future, Apple confirmed that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-statement-on-next-generation-carplay/">continues to work with several auto makers on next-generation CarPlay</a>. However, Apple is no longer providing a timeframe for next-generation CarPlay's launch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/ios-18-4-upgrades-carplay-in-two-ways/">Apple Upgrades CarPlay in Two Ways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-upgrades-carplay-in-two-ways.2452900/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new M4 MacBook Air is now being delivered to customers worldwide following the pre-order period that began on March 5. The same goes for Apple's new versions of the iPad, iPad Air, and Mac Studio. For those who didn't pre-order or chose to wait, the new models are currently readily available, and select Apple Store locations globally are offering same-day or next-day pickup options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Everything-M3-iPad-Air-M4-MacBook-Air-Mac-M4-Studio-Thumb-3-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993415" /><br/>
As of writing, Apple's online stores in the United States and Canada haven't yet been updated to show pickup availability, but shortages aren't generally expected and there is unlikely to be much variation state by state. Meanwhile across the pond, all models and configurations are available for Apple Store pickup today in many European countries including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. <br/>
<br/>
To order a product with ‌Apple Store‌ pickup, add the product to your bag on Apple.com or in the ‌Apple Store‌ app, proceed to checkout, select the "I'll pick it up" option, enter your ZIP or postal code, choose an available ‌Apple Store‌ location, select a pickup date, and select a 15-minute check-in window. Payment is completed online, and a valid government-issued photo ID and the order number may be required upon pickup.<br/>
<br/>
The new devices are also available for walk-in customers at ‌Apple Store‌ locations with sufficient inventory, but availability can't be guaranteed. Walk-in customers may be placed into a separate queue with lower priority upon arrival to the store.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's updates focused on more powerful chips with minimal other changes. The MacBook Air now features an M4 chip and a new Sky Blue color, while the Mac Studio gains Thunderbolt 5 ports and options for either an M4 Max or M3 Ultra chip.<br/>
<br/>
On Apple's iPad lineup, the 11-inch iPad now runs on an A16 chip (which lacks Apple Intelligence support), while the iPad Air upgrades to an M3 chip, replacing the M2. Pricing starts at &#36;349 for the iPad, &#36;599 for the iPad Air, &#36;999 for the MacBook Air, and &#36;1,999 for the Mac Studio.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expected to replace the iPhone "Plus" model in its upcoming iPhone 17 lineup with an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, and so a lot of the rumors about the device have naturally concerned its thickness. Today, we may have learned one more detail in that regard.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iPhone-17-Air-Size-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993585" /><br/>
<em>The Information</em> has said the iPhone 17 Air will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">around 6mm thick</a>, while Jeff Pu thinks it will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/iphone-17-air-could-be-thinnest-iphone-ever/">6mm thick</a>. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 17 Air will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">5.5mm thick</a> at its thinnest point, which likely means it will have a 5.5mm chassis with a thicker rear camera bump area. <br/>
<br/>
Apparently taking Kuo's prediction as accurate, Chinese leaker Ice Universe has today claimed that the camera bump on the iPhone 17 Air is <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PidH1oskN">4.00mm</a> thick, indicating that the device is 9.5mm thick in total at its thickest point.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/revealed-entire-iphone-17-lineups-camera-designs/">leaks</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/iphone-17-air-front-page-tech-renders/">renders</a>, the iPhone 17 Air has a single rear camera on the left and a microphone and LED flash on the right, all within the confines of an elongated bump, similar to the runway-style bar seen on Google Pixel phones. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-sizes-change-next-year-what-to-know/">iPhone 17 in New Sizes This Year: What to Know</a></li></ul><br/>
Other rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/iphone-17-air-now-rumored-to-feature-6-7-inch-display/">6.6-inch to 6.7-inch display</a>, which means it will be larger than the iPhone 17 (6.3 inches) but smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max (6.9 inches). It's worth noting that Ice Universe last week claimed that the Air model is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-air-same-size-iphone-16-pro-max/">same size of the Pro Max model</a> in all but thickness, but this is inconsistent with the majority of rumors so far.<br/>

Ice Universe has previously revealed accurate dimensions of iPhones before they are released, including the sizes of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/iphone-16-pro-max-design-dimensions/">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. If the leaker's claim last week was just a blip, there could be something to this latest leak about the device's dimensions at its thickest point. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup around its usual mid-September time frame. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ice-universe/">Ice Universe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/iphone-17-air-9-5mm-thick-including-camera/">iPhone 17 Air Reportedly 9.5mm Thick At Camera Bump End</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-reportedly-9-5mm-thick-at-camera-bump-end.2452878/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 17 Pro to Use Advanced Cooling System for Better Performance</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will utilize vapor chamber cooling technology to improve thermal performance, according to the Chinese leaker known as <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PibBvE4I7">Instant Digital</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-17-pro-asherdipps.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990412" /><br/>
Vapor chamber technology is already common in many premium Android smartphones. By dispersing heat across a larger surface area, it helps prevent thermal throttling and keeps performance stable, which is a major advantage in thinner, more compact devices.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't the first time we have heard rumors about Apple's use of vapour chamber heatsinks in the iPhone 17 series. In January, Chinese tech news site <em>MyDrivers</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/iphone-17-major-thermal-upgrade/">claimed</a> that the entire iPhone 17 lineup, including the regular iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max, would use the tech. <br/>
<br/>
In contrast, Instant Digital believes that it will only feature in the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models, which are expected to be powered by Apple's A19 Pro chip. "Combined with the A19 Pro's enhanced thermal management, the devices maintain high performance under heavy load with virtually no throttling," added the leaker.<br/>
<br/>
In another <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PibF5BaRG">post on Weibo</a>, Instant Digital also played down rumors that there will be any changes to the front of the iPhone 17: "This year's upgrades are focused on the internals and back, so there's likely no change on the front. The notch size and bezel are probably the same."<br/>
<br/>
Last month, another <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-max-smaller-dynamic-island/">rumor out of China</a> claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a smaller Dynamic Island, siding with analyst Jeff Pu's prediction <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">last year</a> that the device will adopt a metalens for Face ID that results in a "much narrowed" Dynamic Island. Pu in 2024 reiterated the claim <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/iphone-17-pro-max-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/">several times</a>, and he has a fairly good track record with Apple rumors. However, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in January said that the Dynamic Island on iPhone 17 models will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/iphone-17-no-dynamic-island-change/">remain unchanged</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 14 Pro models in 2022, and it is also available on all iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models (except the entry-level iPhone 16e), but the size has not changed in successive models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to significantly revamp the rear camera design on its upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models, moving away from the familiar square camera bump to a distinctive aluminum camera bar that spans the device's width, according to recent reports.<br/>
<br/>
The redesign extends to the new iPhone 17 Air model, which is set to replace the Plus variant in Apple's lineup. This thinner device will allegedly feature a similar horizontal camera bar design, though it will accommodate just a single camera lens.<br/>

In contrast, the base iPhone 17 is expected to maintain the current camera design language seen in the iPhone 16 series, helping to further differentiate Apple's premium and standard offerings. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 series next September. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/iphone-17-pro-advanced-cooling-better-performance/">iPhone 17 Pro to Use Advanced Cooling System for Better Performance</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-to-use-advanced-cooling-system-for-better-performance.2452872/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is bringing support for the Apple Account Card in the Wallet app to the UK, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and Austria, <a href="https://x.com/nicolas09F9/status/1899494286468502007">according to Nicolás Alvarez</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/apple-account-card-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846914" /><br/>
The Apple Account Card option for Wallet <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/25/apple-account-card-wallet-app/">started rolling out</a> in 2022, but it has been limited to a small number of countries since launch. The card displays the Apple credit balance associated with a user's Apple Account, and the card can be used to make purchases in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>, online, or for apps, subscriptions, and other Apple services.<br/>
<br/>
Money can be added to an Apple Account Card in Wallet using the included "Add Money" feature, which relies on a linked credit or debit card. &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; gift cards also add to the Apple Account balance.<br/>
<br/>
Adding an Apple Account Card can be done by opening up the Wallet app, tapping the "+" button, and choosing the option from the Available Cards list.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/apple-immersive-video-metallica.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994377" /><br/>
The Metallica concert experience was filmed in Mexico City during the second-year finale of the band's M72 World Tour. It includes full performances of three songs, including "Whiplash," "One," and "Enter Sandman."<br/>
<br/>
The concert was captured using Apple Immersive Video, and it provides a high-resolution 180-degree video along with Spatial Audio. Apple built a custom stage layout with 14 Apple Immersive Video cameras using a mix os stabilized cameras, cable-suspended cameras, and remote-controlled camera dolly systems that moved around the stage.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the experience provides "unprecedented access" to Metallica members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo, with views as close as the Snake Pit.<br/>
<blockquote>"Game changing is putting it lightly," said Lars Ulrich of Metallica. "Seeing our concert like that, along with the energy of the Mexico City fans -- it's very immersive, and it's super fun. We've always been interested in pushing the boundaries, and Metallica on Apple Vision Pro is exactly that."</blockquote><br/>
The video launches on Friday, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> demos at retail stores will provide a preview. Metallica's new EP, M72 World Tour: Mexico City is also launching on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> on Friday.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/metallica-concert-apple-vision-pro/">Metallica Immersive Concert Experience Coming to Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/metallica-immersive-concert-experience-coming-to-apple-vision-pro.2452846/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last week introduced new versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, with plans to launch the devices on March 12. It's already Wednesday, March 12 in New Zealand and Australia, which means customers who pre-ordered one of Apple's new iPads or Macs have started receiving their devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M4-MacBook-Air-13-and-15-inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994258" /><br/>
Apple's updates focused primarily on introducing more powerful chips, with few other changes. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; received an M4 chip and a new Sky Blue color option, while the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; is available with Thunderbolt 5 ports and either an M4 Max chip or an M3 Ultra chip.<br/>
<br/>
The low-cost 11-inch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; now comes with an A16 chip (which does not support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>), while the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; has an updated M3 chip, an improvement over the prior <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>. Pricing on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; starts at &#36;349, while pricing on the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;599. Apple's &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is its most affordable notebook with a &#36;999 starting price, while the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,999.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who did not pre-order will be able to visit an Apple retail store to pick up one of the new iPads or a stock &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; or &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; configuration. Apple should have adequate stock of base &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Mac configurations around the world, and customers in Australia will be the first to be able to purchase one of the new products from an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The new iPads and Macs are available in Australia and New Zealand now, and will soon launch in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With new iOS software updates, Apple has been automatically turning <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> on again even for users who have disabled it, a decision that has become increasingly frustrating for those that don't want to use &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963902" /><br/>
After installing iOS 18.3.2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users have noticed that &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; is <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-ios-18-3-2-with-bug-fixes.2452817/post-33793315">automatically turned on</a>, regardless of whether it was turned off prior to the update being installed. There is an &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; splash screen that comes up after updating, and there is no option other than tapping "Continue," which turns on &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
If you've updated to iOS 18.3.2 and do not want &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; enabled, you will need to go the Settings app, tap on &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, and then toggle it off. When &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; is enabled, it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/save-up-to-21gb-storage-disable-apple-intelligence/">consumes up to 7GB</a> of storage space for local AI models, which is an inconvenience when storage space is limited.<br/>
<br/>
Auto-on for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; was also a problem for some users with the prior iOS 18.3.1 update, and Apple has not changed the setting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-intelligence-re-enabled-in-latest-updates/">despite complaints</a> after iOS 18.3.1 was released. The issue can also affect iPadOS and macOS users, so make sure to check your &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; settings on each device after updating.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/ios-18-3-2-apple-intelligence-auto-on/">PSA: iOS 18.3.2 Re-Enables Apple Intelligence If You Turned It Off</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-ios-18-3-2-re-enables-apple-intelligence-if-you-turned-it-off.2452829/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 18.3.2, iPadOS 18.3.2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.3.2, and visionOS 2.3.2 updates that Apple released today include an important security fix for a WebKit vulnerability that may have been actively exploited.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896108" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/bug-security-vulnerability-issue-fix-larry.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
In <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122281">Apple's security notes</a> for each update, Apple says that maliciously crafted web content could break out of the Web Content sandbox. Most of the issue was addressed with iOS 17.2, but Apple has added an additional supplementary fix in today's updates.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that it is aware of a report that the vulnerability may have been exploited "in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals," though it is worth noting that these attacks happened prior to iOS 17.2.<br/>
<br/>
The issue was addressed with improved checks to prevent unauthorized actions.<br/>
<br/>
Given that there is a vulnerability that is known to have been exploited in the wild, it is a good idea to update your devices to the latest software for optimal protection.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/ios-18-3-2-security-fixes/">Make Sure to Update: iOS 18.3.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.3.2 Include Important Security Fixes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/make-sure-to-update-ios-18-3-2-and-macos-sequoia-15-3-2-include-important-security-fixes.2452827/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After announcing that some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">Apple Intelligence Siri features</a> promised for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will be delayed, Apple has tweaked the wording on its &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> webpages to remove mentions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> capabilities that are being pushed back.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/siri-personal-awareness-change-mac-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994356" /><br/>
There is a section called "The start of a new era for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;," that previously suggested &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; was more capable and helpful than ever thanks to personal context, a feature that is not yet available.<br/>
<br/>
Now the wording has been updated to point out more expansive product knowledge instead, as this is a feature that Apple rolled out with iOS 18.2.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Before:</strong> With richer language understanding and awareness of your personal context, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is more capable and helpful than ever.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>After:</strong> With richer language understanding and expansive product knowledge about your devices, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is more helpful than ever.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Apple has been highlighting unavailable &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features since last June, both on its website and in ads, but with the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; delay, Apple is cleaning up its wording to avoid misleading customers. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features were a main selling point of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, but none of them were available when the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models launched. Some capabilities came in iOS 18.1, iOS 18.2, and iOS 18.3, but not the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that Apple has been demonstrating.<br/>
<br/>
Apple tied the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, leading to disappointment when it became clear the updated &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will not be available in the near future. Earlier this week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-pulls-iphone-16-ad-more-personal-siri/">removed an iPhone 16 ad</a> showing off a "more personal &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;," so it is no surprise that the website wording is being updated as well.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Apple said that the more personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that is able to do more in and across apps is "taking us longer than we thought to deliver," with the capabilities set to start rolling out "in the coming year."<br/>
<br/>
Apple planned to release &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that include personalized context, onscreen awareness, and deeper app integration with iOS 18.4, but when the first couple of iOS 18.4 betas came out with no new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality, it became clear that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; was not ready. There was some speculation that Apple could bring the abilities to iOS 18.5, but it's now sounding like the smarter, more capable &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that's been promised won't be introduced until <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/apple-removes-siri-personal-context-reference/">Apple Continues Removing iOS 18 Siri Personal Context References After Delay</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continues-removing-ios-18-siri-personal-context-references-after-delay.2452824/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Ars Technica</em>'s Andrew Cunningham today published his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/m4-max-and-m3-ultra-mac-studio-review-a-weird-update-but-it-mostly-works/">review of the new Mac Studio</a>. In it, he confirmed that the Mac Studio with the M4 Max chip lacks High Power Mode for intensive workloads. He also tested the higher-end Mac Studio with the M3 Ultra chip, and he did not mention anything about High Power Mode for that model either.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/High-Power-Mode-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921421" /><br/>
Mac Studio review units are running macOS Sequoia 15.3, according to the Geekbench database. macOS Sequoia 15.4 is currently in beta testing, but it is unclear if that update will expand High Power Mode to the Mac Studio.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/101613">says</a> High Power Mode allows a Mac's fans to run at higher speeds, and this additional cooling allows the system to deliver higher performance for graphics-intensive sustained workloads, such as 8K video color grading. On supported Macs, the setting can be turned on when the computer is on battery power or plugged in.<br/>
<br/>
High Power Mode is currently available on 14-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 Max, M4 Pro, or M4 Max chips, 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M4 Pro or M1 Max through M4 Max chips, and on the Mac mini with the M4 Pro chip.<br/>
<br/>
Given that High Power Mode is offered on MacBook Pro models with the M4 Max chip, it seems like Apple has made a deliberate choice to not offer it on the Mac Studio with the same chip. It could simply be that the Mac Studio is a large desktop computer, meaning that High Power Mode is not necessary due to the lack of battery life or thermal constraints to begin with. However, we have not confirmed Apple's actual reasoning behind this decision.<br/>
<br/>
It might not matter much, regardless.<br/>
<br/>
In his Mac mini review last year, Cunningham said High Power Mode performance gains were "essentially negligible," despite "considerably increased" fan noise. However, he acknowledged that his tests were short and that High Power Mode could be more beneficial "over many hours of activity." Apple says the feature is for "sustained" workloads.<br/>
<br/>
High Power Mode can be enabled in the System Settings app under "Battery" or "Energy."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/high-power-mode/">High Power Mode</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/mac-studio-still-lacks-high-power-mode/">Mac Studio Still Lacks &#039;High Power Mode&#039; Offered on Some MacBook Pro and Mac Mini Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-studio-still-lacks-high-power-mode-offered-on-some-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-models.2452823/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
