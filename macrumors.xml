		<description><![CDATA[The A17 chip designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus will be made using a fundamentally different manufacturing process to the A17 Pro in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> to cut costs, according to a rumor that has now been clarified by a reliable source.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/A17-Feature-Dark.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-901448" /><br/>
A <a href="https://weibo.com/u/1833340431">Weibo user</a> who claims to be an integrated circuit expert with 25 years of experience working on Intel's Pentium processors was first to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/23/apple-to-switch-tech-behind-a17-to-cut-costs/">float the rumor in June</a>. Now, the same source has clarified Apple's apparent plan for its standard iPhones' chip in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;'s A17 Pro chip is fabricated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/apple-tsmc-3nm-production-capacity/">using TSMC's N3B process</a>, but Apple reportedly plans to switch to the lower-cost N3E process for next year's standard A17 chip designed for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. This will mark the first time that Apple has designed a chip specifically for its standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models. In previous years, Apple simply gave the entire &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup the same chip before staggering them by one year between the standard and the Pro models starting with 2022's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The A15 Bionic chip in the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌‌ Plus is a higher binned variant with one additional GPU core than the A15 used in the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>‌ and ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;‌‌ mini, so some cross-generational differences despite outwardly featuring the same chip would not be unheard of, but this would effectively be the retention of the same name on a fundamentally different chip.<br/>
<br/>
N3B is TSMC's original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> node created in partnership with Apple. N3E, on the other hand, is the simpler and cheaper node that most other TSMC clients will use. N3E has fewer EUV layers and lower transistor density than N3B, resulting in lower efficiency. N3B has also been ready for mass production for longer than N3E, but it has much lower yield. N3B was effectively designed as a trial node and is not compatible with TSMC's successor processes including N3P, N3X, and N3S, meaning that Apple has to redesign its future chips to take advantage of TSMC's innovations.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was originally believed to be planning to use N3B for the A16 Bionic chip, but had to revert to N4 because it was not ready in time. It is likely the case that Apple is using the N3B CPU and GPU core design <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/23/iphone-14-pro-setback-removed-graphics-processor/">originally designed for the A16 Bionic</a> in the A17 Pro, before switching to the original A17 designs with N3E later in 2024. This architecture will presumably be iterated on through TSMC's successor nodes for chips like the "A18" and "A19."<br/>
<br/>
The Weibo user was first to say that the standard &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; models would retain the A15 Bionic chip, with the A16 being exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro models – a rumor that went on to be widely corroborated and turned out true. Earlier this month, Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-16-rumored-to-feature-enhanced-a17-and-8gb/">corroborated the rumor</a> about 2024's A17 chip being fabricated with N3E, adding that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus will also feature 8GB of memory, up from 6GB on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phone-chip-expert/">Phone Chip Expert</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-first-chip-designed-for-standard/">iPhone 16 to Feature First A-Series Chip Designed Specifically for Standard Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-to-feature-first-a-series-chip-designed-specifically-for-standard-models.2404586/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Repair website iFixit today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmQHgWNAg24">video teardown</a> of the new iPhone 15 Pro Max, providing a closer look inside the top-of-the-line device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Cameras.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913544" /><br/>
While the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a similar internal design as the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the device has a redesigned frame that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/iphone-15-pro-models-more-repairable/">allows the back glass panel to be easily removed</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/iphone-15-pro-cracked-glass-repair-fees-lower/">lower repair fees</a> for cracked glass for customers without AppleCare+ coverage. This change was first made to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus last year.<br/>
<br/>
The teardown provides a brief glimpse at the iPhone 15 Pro Max's upgraded Telephoto lens with a tetraprism system, which enables 5x optical zoom. iFixit said the Main and Ultra Wide lenses on the device appear to look the same as the ones on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, in line with <a href="https://twitter.com/Tech_Reve/status/1705409878481908094">information shared on social media</a> last week. This suggests camera improvements beyond 5x optical zoom are the result of the A17 Pro chip and software optimizations. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmQHgWNAg24?si=188W1HfRxEASkBYj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
iFixit says the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a similar logic board as the iPhone 15 Pro. In addition to the A17 Pro chip, the teardown confirms that the device is equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X70 modem, which <a href="https://speedsmart.net/blog/post/2005/iPhone-15-Pro-up-to-24-Faster-5G-Download-Speeds">reportedly enables faster 5G speeds</a> as expected.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, iFixit gave the iPhone 15 Pro Max a low repairability score of 4/10, in part due to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ifixit-lowers-iphone-14-repairability-score/">Apple's parts pairing requirement</a> that it says harms independent repair shops.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/">Teardown</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-15-pro-max-teardown-ifixit/">iPhone 15 Pro Max Teardown: X70 Modem for Faster 5G, 5x Optical Zoom Lens, A17 Pro Chip, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-max-teardown-x70-modem-for-faster-5g-5x-optical-zoom-lens-a17-pro-chip-and-more.2404576/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple to Launch iPad Mini 7 Later This Year, Industry Report Suggests</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple could be preparing to release a seventh-generation iPad mini before the end of the year, based on a new report by <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230922VL207/digitimes-research-pc-ce-tablet.html">DigiTimes</a></em>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/ipad-mini-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-888416" /><br/>
In an article discussing stagnating global tablet demand in the second half of 2023, the Taiwan-based outlet forecasts an uptick in Apple's share of the market owing to orders for a "small-size" iPad in the fourth quarter. From the report (see bold): <blockquote>In the second quarter, iPad shipments had a sequential decline higher than those of non-iPad tablets, resulting in iPads' combined shipment share seeing two consecutive quarters of decline. However, the share will gradually pick up during the second half because of Apple's inventory replenishment needs in the third quarter and <strong>orders for a new small-size iPad in the fourth quarter</strong>, the figures show.</blockquote><em>DigiTimes</em> obtains its information from the suppliers who manufacture parts for iPhones and other Apple products. Its sources often provide reliable information, but the site has a mixed track record when it comes to interpreting that information and accurately deciphering Apple's plans. It is often best to view information from the site with some skepticism until the info is corroborated by additional sources, especially when it comes to rumors.<br/>
<br/>
That said, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman earlier this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/airpods-apple-watch-ipad-apple-tv-2023/">reported</a> that an iPad mini update with a minor "spec bump" is not out of the question. Last month, the leaker known as "ShrimpApplePro" also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/ipad-mini-7-could-be-coming-later-this-year/">suggested</a> a seventh-generation iPad mini was in the works at Apple, and said that they had seen evidence that at least one new iPad model is coming this year.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/new-ipad-mini-launching-next-year/">January</a> said he believes that the seventh-generation ‌iPad mini‌ is most likely to begin mass production in the first quarter of 2024, and Kuo recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">said</a> he does not expect any new iPad models this year.<br/>
<br/>
If anything happens before the holidays, a chip upgrade may be the most likely feature of a new ‌iPad mini‌. The ‌sixth-generation iPad mini‌ currently contains the A15 Bionic chip, while the new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro use the A16 and A17 Pro chip, respectively. A minor spec bump could also include upgrades to the front and rear cameras, potentially bringing features like Photonic Engine to the ‌iPad‌ for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
The latest iPad Pro models brought connectivity upgrades like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 to the ‌iPad‌ for the first time, so it seems highly likely that these capabilities will also make their way to the ‌iPad mini in the next update‌.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/">Apple to Launch iPad Mini 7 Later This Year, Industry Report Suggests</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-ipad-mini-7-later-this-year-industry-report-suggests.2404552/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

During the event, Capcom also revealed pricing for the mobile ports of <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em>. While both games are free to start, they will require &#36;59.99 and &#36;39.99 in-app purchases, respectively, to unlock the full experience. <br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders have since gone live for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082"><em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> on the App Store</a>, which still lists the game as "Coming Soon – Expected December 31, 2023." Both games will support on screen controls, game controllers, multi-touch, HDR, and more.<br/>
<br/>
For those who haven't been following these games, <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> were showcased during Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; announcement. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are powered by an A17 Pro chip that features a brand new GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, enabling ported console games to be played on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at near-equivalent performance.<br/>
<br/>
DisplayPort support is built into the USB-C port on all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, meaning that the devices can also output video at up to 4K/60Hz natively to a DisplayPort-equipped external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable. On previous iPhones with a Lightning port, video mirroring is limited to 1080p with Apple's Lightning-to-HDMI or Lightning-to-VGA adapters.<br/>
<br/>
Since Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; event, Capcom confirmed that <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> will come to macOS and iPadOS devices with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or better. <em>Resident Evil Village</em> is already available on macOS, so the iOS and iPadOS release will be an independent purchase when it arrives just before Halloween with support for &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models. As a result, <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> will have cross-progression on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, while <em>Resident Evil Village</em> will have cross-progression on iPadOS and iOS only. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/toucharcade/">TouchArcade</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/capcom/">Capcom</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/resident-evil-village-iphone-15-pro-ipad-oct-30/">Resident Evil Village for iPhone 15 Pro and iPad Launches October 30</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resident-evil-village-for-iphone-15-pro-and-ipad-launches-october-30.2404542/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iFixit today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYLLtDxT_sM">shared a video</a> with teardowns of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9, providing a closer look inside the watches.<br/>
<br/>

Notably, the video confirms that the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is equipped with a 564 mAh battery, as <em>MacRumors</em> was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-battery-capacities/">first to report last week</a> via a regulatory database. This is around a 4% larger capacity than the 542 mAh battery in the original Apple Watch Ultra, but Apple says both models have the same battery life of up to 36 hours.<br/>
<br/>
The video also confirms that the 41mm Series 9's battery capacity is 282 mAh, which is unchanged from the 41mm Series 8.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple previously announced that macOS Sonoma will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/macos-sonoma-official-release-date-announced/">released this Tuesday, September 26</a>. The free software update includes many new features and changes for the Mac, including the five that we have highlighted below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-macOS-Sonoma-hero.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900893" /><br/>
In addition to these five features, we have shared the full release notes for macOS Sonoma below for a complete overview of everything new.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Desktop Widgets</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macOS-Sonoma-Widgets.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898329" /><br/>
macOS Sonoma brings widgets to the desktop on the Mac, and they are now fully interactive like on the iPhone. It is even possible to use widgets from your iPhone apps automatically, without having to install the corresponding Mac apps.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/how-widgets-work-macos-sonoma/">Here's How Interactive Widgets Work in macOS Sonoma</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Game Mode</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-macOS-Sonoma-gaming-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898499" /><br/>
<br/>
macOS Sonoma <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/macos-14-game-mode/">features a new Game Mode</a> that temporarily prioritizes CPU and GPU performance for gaming on Apple silicon Macs. Game Mode also reduces audio latency for AirPods and input latency for select game controllers connected via Bluetooth.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Web Apps in Dock</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macOS-Sonoma-Web-App-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913423" /><br/>
<br/>
On macOS Sonoma, any website can be added to the Dock as a web app for convenient access. To create a web app, load the website in Safari, open the File menu, and select Add to Dock. Web apps offer a simplified toolbar and support push notifications.<br/>

macOS Sonoma adds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/macos-sonoma-beta-7-wallpapers/">new Apple TV-like aerial screen savers</a> that feature slow-motion videos of places around the world, such as Yosemite National Park and Dubai. Each screen saver can transition to a matching desktop wallpaper.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Safari Profiles</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macOS-Sonoma-Safari-Profiles.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913427" /><br/>
The latest version of Safari introduced support for profiles, allowing you to keep your browsing separate for work, personal life, and more. Apple says each profile has separate history, cookies, extensions, Tab Groups, and favorites. <br/>
<br/>

<h2>iPhone 15 Models Feature New Setting to Strictly Prevent Charging Beyond 80%</h2><br/>
All of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/iphone-15-80-percent-battery-limit-option/">new battery health setting that prevents the devices from charging beyond 80%</a> at all times.<br/>

This new setting is separate from Apple's pre-existing Optimized Battery Charging feature, which merely delays charging beyond 80% until a better time based on the device's daily charging routine. <br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 models also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-shows-battery-cycle-count/">show the battery's cycle count in the Settings app</a>.<br/>

Keep in mind that these software features are also available on the original second-generation AirPods Pro released in September 2022, so there is no need to update to the new USB-C model to use them.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers are able to individually repair the bottom-right microphone on the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> today from multiple sources.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
The new procedure of replacing this microphone on its own should make these repairs cheaper for customers, and also less wasteful, as part of Apple's focus on environmental responsibility. As for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and other iPhone models, repairing this microphone still requires replacing the entire mid-frame chassis. <br/>
<br/>
For repairs of all other microphones on iPhones, including next to the earpiece and rear camera, a mid-frame replacement is still required.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aasp/">Apple Authorized Service Providers</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/apple-can-repair-iphone-15-bottom-microphone/">Apple Can Now Repair Bottom Microphone on iPhone 15 and 15 Plus</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-can-now-repair-bottom-microphone-on-iphone-15-and-15-plus.2403993/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular new roleplaying game Baldur's Gate 3 is available to play on the Mac starting today. The title can be downloaded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">through the Steam platform</a> and it is playable on Apple silicon Macs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Baldur's Gate 3: Launch Trailer" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuCfkgaaa08" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The game's minimum requirements include the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> processor and 8GB RAM, but the recommended requirements suggest an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> or better Apple silicon chip and at least 16GB RAM. With the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip, the game can be run on low to medium settings, but the recommended requirements support high or ultra settings.<br/>
<br/>
Baldur's Gate 3 was initially released on Windows in August, and it is the third game in the Baldur's Gate series. Players can choose one of six pre-made characters or create a custom character to play. The game is set in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, and it uses turn-based combat.<br/>
<br/>
There are 12 classes and 11 races to choose from, along with options to play solo or online with up to four people.<br/>
<blockquote>Gather your party and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power. Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a mind flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.</blockquote><br/>
Baldur's Gate 3 has received almost universally positive reviews, and it is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">available from Steam</a> for &#36;60.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/baldurs-gate-3-mac/">Baldur&#039;s Gate 3 Now Available on Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3-now-available-on-mac.2403977/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the launch of the iPhone 15 series today, a few readers of our website have reached out to highlight that the devices support USB-C to Ethernet adapters, allowing for a wired internet connection with faster download speeds than Wi-Fi.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Ethernet.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913342" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>iPhone 15 Pro connected to an Ethernet cable via <a href="https://www.prndlcars.com/">former MacRumors editor turned car reviewer Jordan Golson</a></em></div><br/>
Apple confirmed this information in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213839">support document</a> last week, with USB to Ethernet adapters listed as compatible with iPhone 15 models. When an iPhone is connected to an Ethernet cable, an otherwise hidden Ethernet menu appears in the Settings app with IP-related information and various configuration options.<br/>
<br/>
One reader informed us that their iPhone 15 Pro connected to Ethernet achieved a peak download speed of over 800 Mbps in a speed test.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Ethernet-Setting.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913346" /><br/>
While this is one of the various clever ways that the USB-C port on the iPhone 15 models can be used, it should be known that previous iPhones with the Lightning connector also supported Ethernet with an adapter. Nevertheless, we have decided to highlight this information as a helpful tip since it is getting attention.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and 15 Pro, Apple introduced a new case material called "FineWoven" as an alternative to leather, and unfortunately, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">it has not proven popular</a> with some customers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ifixit-finewoven-case.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913311" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Image of FineWoven case under microscope from iFixit</div></em><br/>
Given the criticism of the FineWoven case, teardown site <em>iFixit</em> obtained one of the accessories and decided <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/82789/unweaving-the-mystery-apples-finewoven-case-under-the-microscope">to take it apart</a> to get a closer look.<br/>
<br/>
Using a digital microscope, iFixit viewed the FineWoven fabric at 52x and 490x magnification, confirming that it is indeed made up of bundles of tightly woven fibers. Each fiber is much smaller than a strand of hair, measuring in at about six microns thick.<br/>
<br/>
Groups of the individual fibers make up threads that are around 150 microns thick, and iFixit says the microtwill material that Apple is using is not too far off from high-end jackets from companies like Patagonia and Arc'teryx.<br/>
<br/>
When the FineWoven fabric is scratched, the fibers don't break, but the scratch does cause the affected fibers to reflect light irregularly, which means there's a visual mark. The softness of the material also means that items in the pocket with the case can leave an indentation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-finewoven-cases.jpg" alt="" width="2839" height="1177" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910359" /><br/>
Because the FineWoven case is made from fabric, it did stain when exposed to hot sauce and oil, though it was able to resist coffee. When exposed to certain foods or liquids, FineWoven case owners can expect to see the case become stained, and iFixit wasn't able to get the oil or the hot sauce stain out.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit cut the case open to see how it was assembled. The FineWoven fabric is on the outside, with a gray foam inside. Beyond the gray foam, there's a rigid plastic sheet, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> hardware, white foam, another rigid plastic sheet, and an inner layer of FineWoven fabric. All of the layers are thin, and the FineWoven fabric itself is about 0.17mm.<br/>
<br/>
The sides of the case feature the same FineWoven fabric that appears to have been coated in a resin-like material, producing a hard, non-porous surface.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit suggests that those with FineWoven cases protect it with a Durable Water Repellent spray to make the case more resistant to staining and liquid.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/finewoven/">FineWoven</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/ifixit-finewoven-case-teardown/">iFixit Gets Closer Look at Apple&#039;s Maligned FineWoven iPhone 15 Case With Teardown</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-gets-closer-look-at-apples-maligned-finewoven-iphone-15-case-with-teardown.2403945/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Our videographer Dan Barbera just got his new iPhones in, and over on YouTube, he's unboxed the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByhrcCcrng4" title="iPhone 15 &amp; iPhone 15 Pro: Unboxing &amp; Hands-On!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The blue and gray titanium models look fantastic with the new brushed finish, and to go along with them, Dan got the black &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. That model also has a sleek new look thanks to the frosted glass back.<br/>
<br/>
The more contoured corners of the new devices make them more comfortable to hold, and the weight reduction for the 15 Pro models is definitely noticeable. As for the display, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; display is brighter than before in the sun, and for the 15 Pro and Pro Max, that slimmed down bezel looks great.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to watch Dan's video to get a first look at all of the new iPhones, and stay tuned because we'll have device comparisons, deep dives into the camera, and more content coming over the next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/iphone-15-unboxing/">Video: iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Unboxing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/video-iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-unboxing.2403904/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple's FineWoven material replaces leather across <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> cases, AirTag accessories, and Apple Watch bands. Many early reviews of the FineWoven items <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">have been negative</a>, criticizing the material's feel, quality, and durability, so we talk over our early thoughts on the new accessories. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> introduce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro/">over 30 new capabilities and improvements</a>, including USB-C and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> across the lineup, as well as a new titanium design and Action button on the high-end models. We dive into some of our favorite standout features and weigh up who should consider upgrading to the latest devices.<br/>

For some extra power while on the go, the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-10000mAh-Portable-Magentic-Wireless%2Fdp%2FB0CDQ5R2R9%2F%3Fth%3D1">Lululook 10,000mAh Power Bank</a> for &#36;38 offers an extra charge for your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>. It has a USB-C port and can also charge the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; wirelessly, holding it in place with magnets. Up to three devices can be charged at one time, and it charges at up to 22.5W. If you want to use it as a desktop charger or to hold up your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> call or a video, there's a built-in stand.

It has the same 22.5W Max, but a more stylish kickstand that holds the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; up for watching videos and making calls in vertical or horizontal orientation. There's an LED display that shows you the current charge level, and with its slim size, it fits easily into a pocket.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you skipping the iPhone 15 Pro and waiting another year to upgrade? If so, we already have some iPhone 16 Pro rumors for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-With-Dynamic-Island.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912423" /><br/>
Below, we recap new features rumored for the iPhone 16 Pro models so far:<ul><li><strong>Larger displays:</strong> The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be equipped with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, respectively, according to Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants. The devices are expected to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-taller-aspect-ratio/">taller aspect ratios</a> as part of this change. By comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max have 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively.</li><br/>
<li><strong>48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens:</strong> The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">upgraded 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera lens</a> for higher-resolution photos with more detail when shooting in 0.5× mode, according to Jeff Pu, a tech analyst at Hong Kong investment firm Haitong International Securities.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi 7 support:</strong> The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">support Wi-Fi 7</a>, according to Pu. This would enable the devices to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 is expected to offer peak data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E.</li><br/>
<li><strong>5x optical zoom on Pro model:</strong> The iPhone 15 Pro Max's tetraprism lens system with 5x optical zoom will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">expand to both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.</li></ul>iPhone 16 Pro models should launch in September 2024, so there is still plenty of time to go, and additional details will surface over the coming months.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Today is the launch day of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, and we're already tracking the first discounts on both wearables. Available at Amazon, you can get &#36;9 off the Apple Watch Series 9 and &#36;19 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with no coupon code required.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-and-Ultra-2-Deals-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913210" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Although not particularly steep discounts, given that it's launch day these are pretty solid deals for anyone who planned on picking up one of the new Apple Watch models today. If you want a bigger markdown, and are okay with buying a previous generation device, Amazon has the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/deals-apple-watch-ultra-698/">original Apple Watch Ultra at &#36;99 off</a> in select colors right now.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F47259FD7-DAA2-4BD0-8CDF-BB87B8981EB6%3Fingress%3D2%26visitId%3D57642ce4-d45d-4563-8ecf-e3fa49fa6837%26ref_%3Dast_bln"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO &#36;19 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 Launch Day Deals</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
A few of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 models are temporarily out of stock right now, but Amazon notes that you can place your order at the discounted price and they will email you when they have an estimated delivery date. Otherwise, most models of both the Ultra 2 and Series 9 will deliver between September 24 and September 27.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> is available in a range of color options and finishes, with an entirely new hue available alongside some popular classics.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; is available in a total of nine colors, one of which is a brand new shade, and two distinct finishes. With an aluminum casing, the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;'s five available color options are:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Pink</li><br/>
<li>Starlight</li><br/>
<li>Silver</li><br/>
<li>Midnight</li><br/>
<li>(PRODUCT)RED</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Starlight, Silver, Midnight, and (PRODUCT)RED were all available on last year's Series 8 models. The only difference with this year's aluminum models is a new soft pink color.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-series-9-aluminum-color-options.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913143" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple's Silver anodized aluminum finish has been available on the company's devices for well over a decade, while Starlight is a warmer shade of silver that subtly angles toward gold or champagne. Midnight is effectively black with a hint of dark blue or navy. Each of the color options has a matching Apple Watch band, except for silver, since it is easily matched with so many other Apple Watch bands.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; is also available with a polished stainless steel casing in four different color options:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Silver</li><br/>
<li>Gold</li><br/>
<li>Graphite</li><br/>
<li>Space Black (Apple Watch Hermès only) </li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
This selection of stainless steel finishes is identical to the previous generation's offerings. While stainless steel is heavier than aluminum, it is much harder and more durable. It may be more liable to scratch due to its polished finish, but they can be buffed out like a conventional watch or an item of jewelry.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/09/apple-watch-series-7-stainless-steel-colors.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-816234" /><br/>
The stainless steel Apple Watch offers a more high-end, fashion-forward aesthetic, especially when paired with a premium band like the Modern Buckle. The Apple Watch Hermès takes the stainless steel Apple Watch to the next level with exclusive watch faces and ultra-premium bands.<br/>
<br/>
The aluminum &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; starts at &#36;399, while the stainless steel model costs &#36;699. The only difference between the casings other than their material and weight is the front crystal, which is upgraded from Ion-X strengthened glass to sapphire crystal on the stainless steel model.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="how_to_decide_on_an_apple_watch_color">How to Decide on an Apple Watch Color</h3><br/>
It is important to consider which band you plan to use with your Apple Watch to ensure that they complement each other. You may prefer more neutral tones such as Midnight or Silver, and then use a more colorful band. Alternatively, you could choose a more striking device color like Pink, and then use a more neutral band. This is also a key consideration if you plan to switch bands regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Silver on both the aluminum and stainless steel models may age better over time as new devices are released since they are more neutral, monochrome shades, and have been offered across multiple Apple Watch generations.<br/>
<br/>
Pink could be a good choice, especially when combined with the Pink Sport Band, for a bold look, especially if you also have a Pink <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> or &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. If you want an Apple Watch in a brand new shade, Pink is also the only option. It is the color that is most noticeably new and indicates that you have the latest-generation device.<br/>
<br/>
Your choice of color may also be dependent on how often you upgrade your ‌Apple Watch. If you upgrade every year or two, you may be more confident in buying a more striking new color. If you upgrade more often, it can be a good idea to get a different color every time since a new color can certainly add some novelty to purchasing a new ‌Apple Watch and make it feel more different from your previous device. Alternatively, if you plan to keep your ‌Apple Watch for many years and upgrade less often, it may be wiser to consider a neutral color or one that is more similar to one you have enjoyed previously.<br/>
<br/>
Customers with multiple Apple devices may also want to get an Apple Watch color that complements their other devices. For example, if you have a Midnight <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, it will be best complemented by the Midnight &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;. If you already have a Gold <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, it will likely be best accompanied by a Gold stainless steel &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;. Likewise, if you have a Starlight Apple Watch, it will obviously match the Starlight &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9-colors-and-finishes/">Apple Watch Series 9 Colors and Finishes: Which Should You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-colors-and-finishes-which-should-you-choose.2403871/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
