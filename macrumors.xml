		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 17.4, Apple began supporting alternative app marketplaces in the European Union, and the first of these stores will be launching soon to give consumers new ways to install apps without having to use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Developer Riley Testut, known for Game Boy Advance emulator GBA4iOS, is working on AltStore, one of several alternative app marketplaces. As noted by <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/the-altstore-an-alternative-app-store-coming-to-eu-will-offer-patreon-backed-apps/">TechCrunch</a></em>, app marketplaces like AltStore will be able to monetize in ways that aren't currently possible. AltStore will accept payment through Patreon rather than making money through paid apps or ads.<br/>
<br/>
To use the first AltStore apps developed by Testut, customers will need to <a href="https://faq.altstore.io/patreon/beta-access">pledge &#36;1 to &#36;3</a> per month through Patreon. Video game emulator Delta will initially be free, and clipboard manager Clip will require a pledge of &#36;1. Later, beta versions of Delta and Clip will require &#36;3 per month to download and use.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe src="https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/112168595273155086/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="400" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://mastodon.social/embed.js" async="async"></script></div><br/>
With Patreon, Testut is able to offer subscription-based pricing that does not provide a 15 to 30 cut to Apple. Patreon collects between five and eight percent of income earned, depending on Patreon join date, plus a payment processing fee that ranges from three to five percent.<br/>
<br/>
Patreon's fees come in below Apple's fees, but should an AltStore app see more than one million first annual installs in a year, Apple will charge a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee for each additional app install. The Core Technology Fee (CTF) makes it risky for free apps to be distributed through alternative app marketplaces, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-eu-core-technology-fee-viral-solution/">Apple recently said</a> that it is working on a solution to avoid bankrupting free apps that go viral and rack up too much in fees.<br/>
<br/>
After AltStore launches and Testut has it working properly, other developers will be able to distribute their apps through it as well. They'll have the option of using Patreon like Testut does for his apps, or another alternative. Patreon has the benefit of providing reward tiers, exclusive blog posts for subscribers, and other alternative content, plus subscriber numbers can be capped to avoid Apple's CTF.<br/>
<br/>
Testut plans to launch the AltStore as soon as he gets final approval from Apple, and as with all alternative app marketplaces, it will be limited to the European Union. Apps can only be installed through alternative means on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, not the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and only in eligible European countries. There are no &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; changes for the rest of the world to allow for alternative app installation.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, the European Commission (EC) opened a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/eu-to-investigate-apple-dma-compliance/">non-compliance investigation into Apple</a> to determine if the changes that it made are sufficient to meet the demands of the Digital Markets Act. Apple could be forced to change some of its rules or change the Core Technology Fee if the EC decides that Apple's updates do not go far enough.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/altstore-eu-iphone-patreon/">AltStore for iPhone in EU Will Have Apps Backed By Patreon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/altstore-for-iphone-in-eu-will-have-apps-backed-by-patreon.2423298/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's 64GB Wi-Fi iPad mini 6 has dropped to a new all-time low price today on Amazon, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9BXKF5%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;375.00</strong></a> in Starlight, down from &#36;499.00. Amazon provides an estimated delivery date between this Wednesday, April 3 and Saturday, April 6 if you order today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPad-mini-6-orange-BG.jpg" alt="" width="1881" height="1058" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816576" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This is now the best price we've ever tracked on the iPad mini 6, and it beats the previous low tracked over the holidays by about &#36;5. Right now, only Amazon has the Starlight color at this price, but you can get the three other colors for &#36;99 off with an on-page coupon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9BXKF5%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;124 OFF</div>iPad mini 6 (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;375.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple's iPad mini 6 was introduced in late 2021, so it's reaching the end of its lifecycle at this point. This is likely why we'll start seeing steeper deals on the miniature tablet, which includes the A15 Bionic chip, a USB-C port, and Apple Pencil 2 support.<br/>

Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/">is now &#36;1,000,000</a>, up from a previous limit of &#36;250,000.<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs reportedly plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">end its consumer lending partnership with Apple</a>, but it is unclear how this might impact Apple Card holders.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/apple-card-savings-rate-comparison-april/">Apple Card Savings Account: How the 4.5% Rate Compares in April 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-account-how-the-4-5-rate-compares-in-april-2024.2423294/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has yet to release the first beta of iOS 17.5 for the iPhone, but two changes are already expected with the upcoming software update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943813" /><br/>
iOS 17.5 will likely allow iPhone users in the EU to download apps directly from the websites of eligible developers, and the update might include some changes to how Apple ID recovery contacts work. More details about these potential changes follow.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Web Distribution</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-ios-app-store-safari-changes.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933983" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">Apple recently announced</a> that eligible developers will soon be able to distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website they own. Apple said this new "Web Distribution" feature will be available starting "later this spring" with an upcoming software update for the iPhone, which presumably refers to iOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
"Web Distribution" will be limited to larger developers based in the EU. To qualify for this distribution method, Apple says the developer must be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more, and have an app that had more than one million annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
"Web Distribution" builds upon the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">alternative app marketplaces</a> that Apple already allows on the iPhone in the EU starting with iOS 17.4. Apple has made these app-related changes to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple ID Recovery Contact Changes</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/Recovery-Contact-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-820584" /><br/>
iOS 17.5 may include some changes to Apple ID recovery contacts, according to known tipster <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolas09F9/status/1773052260450197992">Nicolás Álvarez</a>. However, he did not share any specific details, and he said there is a chance that the changes would not be visible to users.<br/>
<br/>
Setting up recovery contacts for your Apple ID can help to ensure that you always have access to your account, even if you forget the password or a linked device's passcode.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/set-recovery-contact-apple-account/">How to Set a Recovery Contact for Your Apple ID Account</a></li></ul><h2>Timing</h2><br/>
iOS 17.5 will likely be released to the public before the end of May.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added a handful of devices to its public-facing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage and obsolete products list</a>, including some older iPhone and iPad models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/a-iphone-6-plus-ad.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-827724" /><br/>
Apple now considers the iPhone 6 Plus to be "obsolete" worldwide, meaning that Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers no longer offer repairs or other hardware service for the device. Apple says it considers a product "obsolete" once seven years have passed since the company last distributed it for sale.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in September 2014, with key features including larger screens than previous models and Apple Pay support. Apple discontinued the iPhone 6 Plus in September 2016, but the iPhone 6 remained available through resellers in select countries for a few more years, so it is not yet considered "obsolete."<br/>
<br/>
On the software side, iOS 13 dropped support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2019.<br/>
<br/>
As for the iPad, Apple now considers the fourth-generation iPad mini to be "vintage," meaning that more than five years have passed since the company stopped distributing the device for sale. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers continue to offer repairs for vintage products for up to two more years, subject to parts availability.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also added the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to its "vintage" products list, but in the (PRODUCT)RED color only. The devices remained available in other colors for longer, so those colors are not "vintage" yet.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/apple-says-iphone-6-plus-is-now-obsolete/">Apple Says iPhone 6 Plus Now &#039;Obsolete&#039; and iPad Mini 4 Now &#039;Vintage&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphone-6-plus-now-obsolete-and-ipad-mini-4-now-vintage.2423274/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is currently offering its corporate and retail employees 40% off select Link Bracelet and Milanese Loop bands for the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-Link-Bracelets.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928625" /><br/>
In the U.S., the Link Bracelet is available for &#36;209 on Apple's online store for employees, down from &#36;349 regularly. The Milanese Loop is available for &#36;59, down from &#36;99. Both bands were introduced alongside the original Apple Watch in 2015.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also offering employees 50% off various Black Unity and Pride Edition bands, as well as the Sport Band in the Midnight color only.<br/>
<br/>
Apple offers employees special discounts on a rotating selection of products, so it is unclear whether this is another routine sale, or if the company plans to discontinue the Link Bracelet and Milanese Loop in the future and is clearing inventory.<br/>
<br/>
It has been rumored that at least one next-generation Apple Watch model will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/your-apple-watch-bands-may-not-work-with-new-model/">not be compatible with existing Apple Watch bands</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[The iPhone 15 offers "lots of storage for lots of photos," or at least that's what Apple boasts in its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-iphone-15-storage-ad/">latest ad</a>. Whether that rings true for you depends on what you do with your iPhone, and which storage option you choose. But before you open your wallet, here are some things to consider.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/iPhone-12-128GB-Feature.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-741340" /><br/>
The entry-level storage tier for the iPhone 15 is 128GB. That's a notable increase from the 64GB baseline that persisted until the iPhone 13 in 2021. When you consider that 2018's iPhone X came with as little as 64GB, the base storage option for Apple's latest device might even begin to sound generous.<br/>
<br/>
However, this generational upward shift simply reflects the growing demand for more storage space as our digital habits broaden to encompass everything from high-resolution photography and multi-gigabyte triple-A games to extensive app libraries.<br/>
<br/>
With the iPhone 15's camera capabilities now including 48-megapixel photos and 4K video recording, the space required for these high-resolution files is substantial. These advancements undoubtedly enhance the quality of content captured, but they also eat up local storage capacity, rendering what once seemed like ample space insufficient for the needs of many users.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="icloud_to_the_rescue">iCloud to the Rescue?</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/icloud-plus-storage-tiers.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910389" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple's iCloud service presents a solution to device storage limitations, offering a range of plans that extend beyond the meager 5GB of free storage – which, frankly, is insufficient for most users. Apple's paid ‌iCloud‌+ storage subscription plans offer 50GB, 200GB, and 2TB. All ‌the plans include additional features like ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay, Hide My Email, and Custom Email Domains. Currently, subscribers pay &#36;0.99 per month for 50GB of cloud storage, &#36;2.99 per month for 200GB, and &#36;9.99 per month for 2 TB. <br/>
<br/>
Recently, Apple also added options for 6TB and 12TB of storage, addressing the needs of users with extensive storage requirements. However, these come at a cost, both financially and in terms of the reliance on an internet connection for access to your files. The 6TB ‌iCloud‌+ plan is priced at &#36;29.99 per month and the 12TB plan costs &#36;59.99 per month. (For comparison, Google's 5TB and 10TB cloud storage plans cost &#36;24.99 and &#36;49.99 per month.)<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="iphone_storage_vs._icloud">iPhone Storage vs. iCloud</h2><br/>
While the standard iPhone 15 models and the iPhone 15 Pro models start with 128GB of storage, Apple offers 256GB and 512GB upgrade options, with an additional 1TB option for the iPhone 15 Pro. (The iPhone 15 Pro Max models start with double the storage at 256GB, with 512GB and 1TB available when upgrading.)<br/>
<br/>
By offering a maximum capacity of 1TB for the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple is catering to users who prioritize having vast amounts of storage directly on their device. However, this option costs &#36;1,499, which is &#36;700 more expensive than the base model. Therefore it's worth thinking about whether opting for a lower capacity model and supplementing it with additional iCloud storage might be a more economical and practical choice. For example, five years of 2TB iCloud storage would cost &#36;500 – that's &#36;200 cheaper than a 1TB iPhone 15, and could well outlast the lifetime of your device.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever your decision, it will depend on your usage patterns and the value you place on having immediate, offline access to your files versus the flexibility and potential cost savings of cloud storage.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="the_future_of_iphone_storage">The Future of iPhone Storage</h2><br/>
Given the current trajectory, it seems only reasonable that Apple increases the starting capacity of all its iPhone models to 256GB in future generations. Hopefully it also reassesses the paltry 5GB of free iCloud storage it offers – a more generous allocation that reflects the reality of modern digital consumption patterns is surely overdue.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/is-128gb-enough-iphone-storage/">Is 128GB Enough iPhone Storage?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/is-128gb-enough-iphone-storage.2423162/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a> takes place in June, Apple will unveil the next-generation version of macOS, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a>. While most of what we've heard about upcoming software has been focused on iOS, macOS and iOS often share many features, so we have some idea of what's coming to macOS as well.<br/>

<h2>AI Features</h2><br/>
Apple is working to add a number of AI-centric features to its operating system updates, many of which are likely to be cross-platform.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>AI-generated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists.</li><br/>
 	<li>AI-assisted writing in Pages.</li><br/>
 	<li>AI-assisted slide deck creation in Keynote.</li><br/>
 	<li>AI code writing features in Xcode.</li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> improvements and deeper integration with Shortcuts.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could benefit the most from AI improvements, and there are rumors suggesting the personal assistant will be better at natural conversation and user personalization, with the new functionality set to be available cross-device.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is specifically working on improved interaction between &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and the Messages app, so &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do things like auto-complete sentences more effectively and follow multi-part, complex commands.<br/>
<br/>
Deeper integration with the Shortcuts app could allow users to automate complex tasks that involve multiple apps.<br/>
<br/>
There is a slim possibility there might be some kind of chatbot based on generative AI, as rumors suggest that Apple is considering partnering with Google or OpenAI to use their large language models, but Apple may also just be planning to use generative AI for system features. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Other New Additions</h2><br/>
There are several other features that are rumored to be coming to &zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj;.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/">is working on</a> an Adaptive Voice Shortcuts feature for creating a custom phrase and linking an accessibility setting to it, plus there will be an option for organizing Live Speech into user-created categories.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Freeform</strong> - A Scenes feature will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/ios-18-macos-15-freeform-app-scenes/">let users select</a> specific sections or Scenes within their boards for faster navigation and sharing.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Maps</strong> - The Maps app may gain support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-maps-custom-routes-ios-18/">creating custom routes</a>, and it may also be upgraded with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/">topographic maps</a>.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Name</h2><br/>
Since 2013, Apple has been using California landmark names for the Mac operating system, and there's no sign that's going to change. Apple has trademarked several names over the last decade, and some of the possibilities that have yet to be used include Redwood, Grizzly, Sequoia, Mammoth, Pacific, Rincon, Farallon, Miramar, Condor, Diablo, and Shasta.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could go with a non-trademarked name, and it has done so several times in the past.<br/>
<br/>
These are the names that Apple has used since it started naming macOS after California landmarks:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Mavericks</li><br/>
 	<li>Yosemite</li><br/>
 	<li>El Capitan</li><br/>
 	<li>Sierra</li><br/>
 	<li>High Sierra</li><br/>
 	<li>Mojave</li><br/>
 	<li>Catalina</li><br/>
 	<li>Big Sur</li><br/>
 	<li>Monterey</li><br/>
 	<li>Ventura</li><br/>
 	<li>Sonoma</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Release Date</h2><br/>
&zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj; will be previewed at the &zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; keynote on Monday, June 10. The first beta will be provided to developers that same day, and a public beta will likely follow in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj; will then see a public launch sometime in the fall, either in September or October based on past launch timelines.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS software releases, it is typical for Apple to be constantly iterating. When a new version of iOS comes out, a new iOS beta almost always follows the day after. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/">iOS 17.4 was released</a> on Tuesday, March 5, and no iOS 17.5 beta followed as is typical. So when might Apple provide the first iOS 17.5 beta?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Green-and-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940351" /><br/>
It's now been more than three weeks since the launch of iOS 17.4, and pauses like this are unusual, but not unheard of. Sometimes there are droughts because of major features, or holidays, and in this case, it could be both.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is still navigating the app ecosystem changes that were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/">introduced in iOS 17.4</a>, and there are tweaks coming. Apple planned to allow third-party apps to be downloaded only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">from alternative app marketplaces</a>, but now alternative apps will be provided <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">directly from websites too</a>. The option to download an app from a website has not been introduced as of yet, and it is an unexpected change, so it likely requires some behind the scenes work. There are also other potential changes that Apple must make in the EU as the European Commission investigates its compliance, another factor that may be eating up resources.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend marks the Easter holiday, and holidays can sometimes cause betas to be pushed back too.<br/>
<br/>
When considering these factors, it makes some sense that we haven't yet had an iOS 17.5 beta. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said on Thursday that Apple's "beta 1 development finishes next week," which suggests that we could see a beta release next week or the week after.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the wait times between .4 public releases and .5 first developer betas from prior years:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>iOS 13 - 7 days</li><br/>
 <li>iOS 14 - 6 days</li><br/>
 <li>iOS 15 - 22 days</li><br/>
 <li>iOS 16 - 1 day</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
If iOS 17.5 is released on April 2, it will be 28 days between the prior release and the beta software, and if it comes a week after that, it will have been 35 days.<br/>
<br/>
After the beta does go out, we'll likely see a release sometime during the month of May. Prior .5 public releases have happened on May 18, May 16, April 26, and May 20.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/when-will-apple-release-ios-17-5/">When Will Apple Release the iOS 17.5 Beta?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-will-apple-release-the-ios-17-5-beta.2423125/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thieves in Montreal, Canada have been using Apple's AirTags to facilitate vehicle theft, according to a report from Vermont news sites <em><a href="https://www.wcax.com/2024/03/28/montreal-criminals-targeting-local-travelers-with-airtags/">WCAX</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/burlington-gps-trackers-montreal-canada/60310917">NBC5</a></em> (via <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/29/hidden-airtags-road-trips-to-canada/">9to5Mac</a></em>). Police officers in Burlington, Vermont have issued a warning about AirTags for drivers who recently visited Canada.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/airtag-new-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847828" /><br/>
Two Burlington residents found Apple AirTags in their vehicles after returning from trips to Montreal, and these are not the first reports that officers have encountered. One man, Ethan Yang, said he was coming from Montreal after visiting family, and he was alerted that there was an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> traveling with him. He was able to use his phone to make the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; beep, and he was able to locate the device, which had been placed in the front grille of the vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan McLiverty, a cyber analyst at the Vermont Intelligence Center, said that while these incidents have been happening for some time, there has been a new spike in activity. Criminals in Montreal are using AirTags to track cars, steal them, and then sell them abroad. There's also a possibility that the AirTags are being used to tag cars as part of an effort to move drugs across the border.<br/>
<br/>
Travelers who are concerned about being tracked via an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; should know that there are built-in safety features. An &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; will send an alert if it is not within distance of the person that owns it, and this alert will show up on iPhones. Android phones are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/27/google-airtag-android-anti-stalking/">also able to detect</a> unknown Bluetooth trackers, including AirTags, plus Apple has a Tracker Detect app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/android-tracker-detect-app/">that scans for them</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/">AirTag</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/montreal-criminals-airtag-car-theft/">Criminals in Montreal Using AirTags to Steal Vehicles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/criminals-in-montreal-using-airtags-to-steal-vehicles.2423122/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">Apple announced</a> that its 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) will take place between June 10 and June 14. The event is almost certain to see the introduction of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and all of Apple's other major upcoming software updates.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is expected to focus on artificial intelligence features, likely <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-google-gemini-ios-18-iphone/">powered by Google's Gemini</a>. New AI capabilities are rumored to come to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, Messages, Shortcuts, Spotlight, Health, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, Keynote, Pages, and Numbers, but the company is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/ios-18-reportedly-wont-have-apple-chatbot/">stop short</a> of offering a full-fledged AI chatbot. <br/>
<br/>
Beyond AI, &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will reportedly bring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-home-screen-app-icon-customization/">more flexible Home Screen customization</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-maps-custom-routes-ios-18/">custom routes</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/">topographic maps</a> in the Maps app, "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/ios-18-macos-15-freeform-app-scenes/">scenes</a>" in the Freeform app, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a> support, new accessibility features such as a hearing aid mode for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, and potentially a slight redesign inspired by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>.<br/>

We saw Apple's 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air hit multiple new all-time low prices this week, and they're all still available on Amazon. Prices start as low as &#36;999.00 for the 256GB 13-inch M3 MacBook Air, and for 15-inch models this sale has expanded since we originally posted, now including two 512GB models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch SE</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-watch-se-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944157" /><br/>

<br/>
Next, the Apple Watch SE hit second-best prices at Amazon this week, available for &#36;60 off both the 40mm and 44mm GPS models. Compared to previous sales, these are just &#36;10 higher than all-time low prices, so they're still great deals for anyone shopping for a cheaper Apple Watch this Spring.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag</h2><br/>

<br/>
Finally, Amazon has a record low price on the AirTag 4-Pack this week, available for &#36;74.99, down from &#36;99.00. This is one of the only times we've tracked the AirTag 4-Pack at this low price in 2024, so we definitely recommend purchasing if you've been waiting for a great deal.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In November, Apple announced that the iPhone would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> (Rich Communication Services) in the Messages app starting "later" in 2024, and Google has now revealed a more narrow timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In a since-deleted section of the revamped <a href="https://messages.google.com/">Google Messages web page</a>, spotted <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/28/iphone-rcs-fall-2024/">by <em>9to5Google</em></a>, Google said that Apple would be adopting RCS on the iPhone in the "fall of 2024." This timeframe suggests that RCS support will be added to the iPhone with iOS 18, which should be available in beta in June and released in September. At the latest, support should be added in iOS 18.1, which is likely to be released in October.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Google-RCS-iOS-Late-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="427" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944151" /><br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements in the Messages app for conversations between iPhones and Android smartphones:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul>These modern features are already available for iMessage, and in many third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/google-reveals-rcs-on-iphone-timing/">Google Reveals When to Expect RCS Support on iPhone for Improved Texting With Android Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-reveals-when-to-expect-rcs-support-on-iphone-for-improved-texting-with-android-users.2423092/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>&#36;3 App Shoots Better Quality Spatial Video Than iPhone&#039;s Camera App</title>

		<description><![CDATA[A &#36;3 third-party app can now record spatial video on iPhone 15 Pro models in a higher resolution than Apple's very own Camera app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-spatial-video-capture-lifestyle.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944102" /><br/>
Thanks to an update first spotted by <em><a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/spatiality-1080p-60fps-4k-30fps-capture/">UploadVR</a></em>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/spatialify/id6471922894">Spatialify</a> can now record spatial videos with HDR in 1080p at 60fps or in 4K at 30fps. In comparison, Apple's native Camera app is limited to recording spatial video in 1080p at 30fps.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after Apple's Vision Pro headset launched in February in the United States, Apple released iOS 17.2, which brought the new spatial video recording format to iPhone 15 Pro models. <br/>
<br/>
When viewed on iPhone, spatial videos appear as normal videos, but viewed on Vision Pro they provide an immersive viewing experience on Vision Pro that is almost three-dimensional. <br/>
<br/>
Combined with advanced computational videography techniques and HEVC compression, spatial videos filmed at 30fps in 1080p take up around 130MB of storage space for one minute of video, so bear that in mind when shooting using Spatialify's higher resolution options, which will take up substantially more storage.<br/>
<br/>
Spatialify first made headlines back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/spatial-video-iphone-15-vr-headset/">November</a>, before Apple Vision Pro had been launched, when a TestFlight version of the app became available. This allowed iPhone 15 Pro users running the iOS 17.2 beta to record spatial video in a format that could be played back on Meta Quest 3 and other 3D headsets and TVs.<br/>
<br/>
Spatialify is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/spatialify/id6471922894">available to download on the App Store</a>. The app costs &#36;3 and requires an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max to shoot spatial video.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spatial-video/">spatial video</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/spatialify-iphone-app-better-quality-spatial-video/">&#36;3 App Shoots Better Quality Spatial Video Than iPhone&#039;s Camera App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/3-app-shoots-better-quality-spatial-video-than-iphones-camera-app.2423083/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Photos of the first iPhone 16 cases have been shared online, offering another preview of the rumored new vertical rear camera arrangement on the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-16-cases-sonny-dickson-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944092" /><div class="center-wrap"><em><br/>

<br/>
Over the last few months, Apple has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/early-iphone-16-prototypes/">different camera bump designs</a> for the standard iPhone 16 models, all of which have featured a vertical camera arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">latest prototype</a> features the same arrangement with two separate camera rings for the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras, housed within a pill-shaped raised surface, suggesting Apple has drawn inspiration from older iPhone models, such as the ‌iPhone‌ X. The microphone sits next to the lenses, while the camera flash is located on the back of the device outside of the bump.<br/>
<br/>
With the vertical camera layout, Apple is expected to bring spatial video recording to the standard ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus models. Current iPhone 15 models have a diagonal camera arrangement and are not able to capture spatial video, a feature that is limited to the iPhone 15 Pro models and the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/record-spatial-video-iphone/">How to Record Spatial Video on iPhone 15 Pro</a></li></ul><br/>
In addition to the updated camera bump design, recent ‌iPhone 16‌ prototypes have also featured an Action Button similar to the one used on ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, and a pressure-sensitive Capture button for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">shooting horizontal video</a> that sits flush with the frame of the device. Indeed, an opening for the Capture button can be seen in the latest cases.<br/>
<br/>
The existence of cases at this early stage does not necessarily confirm that Apple has settled on this design for the iPhone 16. Third-party case makers also often base their initial case designs for upcoming iPhones on leaks and rumors, so the images may not be true representations. That said, the recent consistent trickle of leaks suggest Apple now has this year's iPhone 16 design nailed down.<br/>

Apple's original plan was to rely on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/apple-has-two-suppliers-for-oled-ipad-pro/">different OLED display suppliers</a> for the upcoming iPad Pro models, with Samsung Display exclusively producing ~11-inch panels and LG Display responsible for the required ~13-inch panels. <br/>
<br/>
The division of labor was reportedly due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for OLED iPad Pro models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies. <br/>
<br/>
Early reports suggested the new models could arrive as soon as this month. However, according to Korean news site <em><a href="https://www.hankooki.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=146958">hankooki.com</a></em>, Samsung has recently faced poor yields of the ~11-inch OLED panels, and it has been unable to meet Apple's order quantity. The shortfall has led Apple to transfer some orders for the smaller panel to LG Display. The latter is subsequently expected to increase its order by hundreds of thousands of units going into next month.<br/>
<br/>
Given the reallocation, LG Display is now likely to supply 60% of the panels for the upcoming iPad Pro models. The company has invested millions of dollars into its sixth-generation small- and medium-sized OLED production line, and has now passed Apple's quality control standards for the smaller panels, enabling it to take up the slack from Samsung.<br/>
<br/>
Apple earlier this month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/apple-produce-8-5-million-oled-ipad-pro/">ordered</a> an initial 8.5 million OLED display panels from the South Korean suppliers. Apple's latest shipments forecast is said to have been a decrease from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to be aiming for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/oled-ipad-lightweight-design-and-image-quality/">"unrivaled" display quality</a> with the new iPad Pro models, which will use a tandem OLED structure. The tandem structure is a method of stacking two layers of OLED light-emitting layers. It is superior to the luminance (screen brightness) and lifespan of a single OLED structure with one light-emitting layer. The iPhone currently uses a single stack OLED display with one light-emitting layer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will now introduce new iPad Pro models alongside new iPad Air models in early May, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple is apparently working to "finish software for the new devices," and the iPad Pro models also need "complex new manufacturing techniques," which Gurman says has contributed to the delay.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/ipad-pro-delay-poor-oled-panel-yields/">iPad Pro Delays Could Be Down to Poor OLED Panel Production Yields</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-delays-could-be-down-to-poor-oled-panel-production-yields.2423078/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models will use an improved process for finishing and coloring titanium, claims a new rumor out of Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Cameras.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913544" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223399160959&navType=by">news aggregator account "yeux1122"</a> on the Naver blog, the new process will make the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max look more polished than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, which have a brushed finish.  <br/>
<br/>
The improved manufacturing process will allegedly result in a glossy appearance that is more akin to the heavily polished stainless steel material used in previous Pro iPhones. However, the new titanium finish will be less prone to scratches compared to stainless steel.<br/>
<br/>
The ‌‌brushed finish on &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models‌‌ is considerably less reflective than the finish of previous Pro iPhones. It is less prone to fingerprints and also reduces scratch visibility. Apart from looks though, Apple's use of a titanium frame for its &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; devices also cut down the weight of the devices. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the titanium frame and aluminum substructure also provides better heat dissipation than any previous-generation Pro models with stainless steel frames, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
A rumor earlier this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/iphone-16-pro-new-space-black-rose-colors/">claimed</a> that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will come in new "space black" and "rose" titanium colors. The "rose" is a gold shade, while "space black" could replace the black titanium option. Apple is expected to release the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> series in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/">iPhone 16 Pro Models Could Feature New Polished Titanium Finish</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-models-could-feature-new-polished-titanium-finish.2423072/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
