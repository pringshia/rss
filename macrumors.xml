		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing to begin supporting digital car keys in the Wallet app for certain MINI vehicles, allowing owners to lock, unlock, and start their vehicles using a pass stored in the Wallet app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/mini-oled-display.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922995" /><br/>
MINI's parent company BMW was the first manufacturer to launch digital car keys in Wallet back in 2020, but it wasn't until earlier today that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> configuration files were updated to specifically list MINI among supported brands, as spotted by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.<br/>
<br/>
Several months ago, MINI unveiled its <a href="https://www.mini.com/en_MS/home/new-family/a-digital-quantum-leap.html">next-generation MINI Operating System 9</a>, which includes MINI Digital Key Plus. The feature will support Ultra Wideband on both iOS and Android, allowing the user to access the vehicle without having to remove their phone from their pocket or bag.<br/>
<br/>
MINI Operating System 9 will run on the auto industry's first large circular OLED display known as the MINI Interaction Unit, a customizable 9.4-inch screen mounted prominently in the center of the dashboard with colorful and immersive themes available to help personalize the vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
The new MINI Interaction Unit with MINI Operating System 9 and MINI Digital Key Plus recently debuted in the new <a href="https://www.mini.com/en_MS/home/new-family/all-electric-mini-cooper.html">all-electric MINI Cooper</a> and <a href="https://www.mini.com/en_MS/home/new-family/all-electric-mini-countryman.html">MINI Countryman</a>, with both vehicles launching next year.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini/">MINI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-digital-car-key-mini-vehicles/">Apple Preparing to Add Support for Digital Car Keys on MINI Vehicles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-add-support-for-digital-car-keys-on-mini-vehicles.2411266/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung is joining the collection of retailers kicking off Black Friday sales today, with <a href="https://howl.me/ck1tDFDYO0R">big savings on monitors and TVs</a>. In total, you can get up to 30 percent off sitewide at Samsung this week, with deals on everything from appliances to smartphones as well.<br/>

<br/>
Samsung is encouraging users to shop through the Shop Samsung mobile app this season, which has some exclusive deals on smartphones, smartwatches, and mobile accessories. Prices on TVs and monitors should be the same on the web as they are on the mobile app, however.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today filed a legal challenge against the European Union's Digital Markets Act ahead of the impending requirement to enable app sideloading on its devices (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/apple-files-legal-challenge-eus-digital-markets-act-2023-11-17/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
The Digital Markets Act (DMA), which came into effect on November 1, 2022, requires "gatekeeper" companies to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/01/dma-eu-law-could-force-major-changes-apple/">open up their services and platforms</a> to other companies and developers. The DMA will have a significant impact on Apple's platforms and it could result in the company being forced to make major changes to the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>‌, Messages, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, and more. For example, Apple will be obliged to enable users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/eu-iphone-app-sideloading-coming-2024/">"sideload" apps</a> from outside the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. The company appears to have already put <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/eu-iphone-app-sideloading-coming-2024/">preparations</a> in place to acquiesce to this demand in early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's new legal case takes issue with specific decisions taken by the European Commission under the DMA, but the exact details of the challenge have not yet been publicized. The case is expected to include an argument against the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; being included on the EU's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">list of gatekeeper platforms</a>, which requires app sideloading to be an option to allow users to avoid the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; if they wish. In a statement at the time, Apple told <em>Bloomberg</em>, "We remain very concerned about the privacy and data security risks the DMA poses for our users." Meta and TikTok have filed similar appeals disputing the European Commission's inclusion of their services.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-files-legal-challenge-against-eu/">Apple Files Legal Challenge Against EU Law as Sideloading Requirement Looms</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-files-legal-challenge-against-eu-law-as-sideloading-requirement-looms.2411261/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Black Friday is now just one week away, and numerous retailers have opened up their official Black Friday sales today. This includes <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home">Sonos</a>, which is offering up to 20 percent off select home theater products and up to 25 percent off portable speakers for this week only.<br/>
<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Sonos very rarely offers straight cash discounts on individual products, with typical sales throughout the year focusing on bundle sales. For Black Friday, the company is finally back with steep markdowns on numerous products, and you don't need to bundle or enter a code for the savings.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to bring OLED display technology to nine new devices by 2027, according to a new report from Taiwan's <a href="https://m.etnews.com/20231116000282"><em>ET News</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/Oled-iPads-and-MackBook-Pro-Notch.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1403" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-824300" /><br/>
Following the introduction of OLED displays on both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/ipad-pro-oled-panel-production-in-2024/">next year</a>, Apple reportedly plans to bring the technology to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> in 2026. While the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will retain a 10.9-inch display, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s screen will grow from 8.3- to 8.7-inches in size. In 2027, Apple will bring OLED display technology to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/">rumored 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> model, which is expected to debut with an LCD display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/">early next year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple apparently plans to use a low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) OLED panel for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and a single-stack low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) panel for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, meaning that ProMotion for refresh rates up to 120Hz will continue to be exclusive to the high-end models. <br/>
<br/>
In 2027, Apple will upgrade the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s OLED panels to a next-generation panel with improved light efficiency via Color Filter on Encapsulation (CoE), which is said to reduce power consumption by around 20%. Use of a color filter could also enable Apple to implement under-display camera technology on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
In 2025, Apple will purportedly bring OLED to the 16-inch MacBook Pro, followed by the 14-inch model in 2026. The 13- and 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models will also transition from LCD to OLED in 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Benefits of OLED include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio, greater color accuracy, and lower power consumption compared to existing models with LCD panels. Apple already uses OLED displays for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Apple Watch models, with the exception of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>. The report notes that OLED panels are also thinner and lighter than LCDs, which offer particular benefits to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/etnews-com/">ETNews</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/">OLED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-plans-to-bring-oled-to-nine-new-devices/">Report: Apple Plans to Bring OLED to Nine New Devices By 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-plans-to-bring-oled-to-nine-new-devices-by-2027.2411257/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The past few weeks have been jam-packed with early Black Friday deals, and now that the shopping holiday is just one week away, we're going back through all of the best sales you might have missed so far this month and updating as prices change and new deals arrive. As with all holiday shopping, there's no guarantee that better prices won't come around later in the season, but if you want to shop early, these are the best deals you will find online.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
B&H Photo has been the only retailer with a consistent discount on Apple's second generation HomePod. Right now, you can get it in both colors for <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746861-REG/apple_mqj73ll_a_homepod_2nd_generation.html/kw/APHOMEPODMN/BI/2696/KBID/3612"><strong>&#36;279.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;299.00. While not a huge markdown, this continues to be the best price we've ever tracked.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746861-REG/apple_mqj73ll_a_homepod_2nd_generation.html/kw/APHOMEPODMN/BI/2696/KBID/3612"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;19 OFF</div>HomePod (Gen 2) for &#36;279.99</div></a></div><h2 id="airpods">AirPods</h2><br/>

<br/>
We originally tracked the AirPods 2 for &#36;69.00 at Amazon in early November, but that sale quickly expired. For now, you can get the AirPods 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;99.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00. This version of the AirPods is perfect for anyone on your holiday shopping list who may be asking for a simple and reliable pair of wireless earbuds, particularly at this insanely low price tag. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;30 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for &#36;99.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Amazon has the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;139.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;169.00. These are upgraded in a few ways from the AirPods 2, with spatial audio, Adaptive EQ, force sensor controls, sweat and water resistance, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;29 OFF</div>AirPods 3 for &#36;139.99</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Lastly, the high-end AirPods Max are available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;449.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;549.00. Discounts on the AirPods Max have been rare over the past few months, so this one is a second-best price on the over-ear headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;99 OFF</div>AirPods Max for &#36;449.99</div></a></div><br/>

Like smartphone plans, you'll have to buy two Apple Watches on an installment plan, add at least one new line, and activate both on your wireless plan. Afterwards, you'll get up to &#36;300 in bill credits over 36 months.<br/>

<h3 id="verizon">Verizon</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-15-candycanes.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922707" /><br/>
At <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-11557999?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2F">Verizon</a>, you can get a special bundle offer if you're interested in purchasing the new <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple-iphone-15-pro%2F">iPhone 15 Pro</a> this holiday season. When you do pick up the new smartphone with a new line on an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan, Verizon will reward you with an Apple TV 4K (64GB) and six months of Apple One at no cost.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple-iphone-15-pro%2F"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">FREE APPLE TV 4K</div>iPhone 15 Pro at Verizon</div></a></div><br/>

The Apple TV 4K promotion requires a smarpthone purchase on an eligible plan and ends on November 15, while the Apple One six month promotion requires a line subscribed to an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan.<br/>
<br/>
For last year's models, you can <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14067866?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fapple-iphone-14-plus%2F">get four iPhone 14 Plus devices for free</a> along with four lines on Unlimited Welcome at &#36;120/month. A new line on any 5G Unlimited plan is required per smartphone. You can also stack this with Verizon's current tablet and smartwatch promotions, which offer up to &#36;279.99 off these devices.<br/>
<br/>
Verizon is also a great place to buy stocking stuffers for techies during the holiday season with its abundant <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-14048362?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fdeals%2Fproducts%2F">accessory sales</a>.

Verizon's <a href="https://visible.pxf.io/c/153062/1007955/12909">Visible</a> brand has &#36;10 off its premium Visible+ service, now priced at &#36;35/month with the promo code 35FOR6 used at checkout.

<br/>
We've been tracking a great all-time low discount on the ninth generation iPad since Prime Day, and the deal is still around in November.

This one is available in both White and Black colors, and it's another best-ever price.<br/>
<br/>
The only downside is Amazon's current shipping estimate, which has a generous one to four week estimate for shipping.

		<description><![CDATA[Signify has released new Philips Hue Contact Sensor firmware that adds support for Apple HomeKit, reports <em><a href="https://hueblog.com/2023/11/16/hue-secure-contact-sensor-now-compatible-with-homekit/">Hueblog.com</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/hue-secure-contact-sensor.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908248" /><br/>
Previously the indoor sensors could only be controlled through the Philips Hue app's Security Center. Now, after updating to the new firmware (1961076030), they appear in the Home app, where users can use the "open" and "closed" status of the sensors to create automations and control other HomeKit devices that are not connected to the Philips Hue Bridge. <br/>
<br/>
Released in September, the Philips Hue Secure Contact Sensor can be applied to doors, windows, cabinets, and more, sending notifications when the contact sensor is opened or closed. Users can remotely activate an alarm that flashes the lights, sounds a siren, and contacts local authorities, plus there are options for customizing camera settings. <br/>
<br/>
As with Philips Hue Secure cameras, the sensors can be linked to lights to activate them when the sensor is triggered, so they can be used for things like turning on the lights in the bathroom when the door is opened.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-secure-contact-sensor/046677580995">Philips Hue Secure Contact Sensors</a> are priced at &#36;40 for one or &#36;70 for a two-pack, and various mounts and other add-on hardware can be purchased for &#36;15 to &#36;50. More information is available on the <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-secure-contact-sensor/046677580995">Hue website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/">Philips Hue</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/philips-hue-secure-contact-sensors-support-homekit/">Philips Hue Secure Contact Sensors Gain HomeKit Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-secure-contact-sensors-gain-homekit-support.2411248/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to have originally designed an Apple Watch Ultra with a dark ceramic back, according to documents filed with the United States Federal Communications Commission and spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ParrotSWD/status/1725358035004965129">@ParrotSWD</a> on X, formerly Twitter (via <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/16/apple-watch-ultra-black-ceramic-back/">9to5Mac</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-ultra-prototype-fcc.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922908" /><br/>
When releasing a new device, tech hardware companies must share details with the FCC, which Apple did for the Apple Watch Ultra prior to its release in September 2022.<br/>
<br/>
In the document, Apple appears to have used an Apple Watch Ultra with a darker, almost black ceramic rear case – similar to Apple Watch Series models – and a plastic-looking Action button with no indent. These design attributes did not make it into the final release.<br/>
<br/>
Often in filings of this type, external photos and other sensitive details are subject to a confidentiality clause with an expiry date, so it is likely that the clause in this one recently expired, hence why the images have only just come to light.<br/>
<br/>
Apple currently offers the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, released in September 2023, in the same natural titanium color as the first-generation model. Prior to launch, some rumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-titanium-rumor/">suggested</a> Apple could release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/31/2023-apple-watch-ultra-new-dark-color/">new darker color option</a> that was originally tested for the previous model but ultimately canceled. It didn't happen.  <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/new-apple-watch-ultra-black-prototype-images/">Darker Apple Watch Ultra Prototype Shown in FCC Filing Images</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/darker-apple-watch-ultra-prototype-shown-in-fcc-filing-images.2411231/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home">Sonos</a> today <a href="https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2023/Sonos-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2023-Results/default.aspx">announced plans</a> to expand into a new "multi-billion dollar" product category in 2024, which is widely believed to be headphones. Sonos CEO Patrick Spence declined to give specific details on the company's plans, but he said that the new product will "complement" current Sonos devices and will "delight customers and drive immediate revenue."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/airpods-max-spring-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-842859" /><br/>
Spence said that Sonos believes it will generate more than &#36;100 million from new products in 2024, and the new product will account for a "large portion" of this revenue in the second half of the year.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors for years now that Sonos intends to enter the headphone market with a pair of wireless headphones that could be similar in design to over-ear headphones like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. Sonos has never confirmed its work on headphones, but a leaked internal memo that was obtained by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/sonos-plans-to-cut-jobs-as-it-prepares-push-into-headphones"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> earlier today confirmed that the company does indeed have a headphone division.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home">Sonos develops</a> wireless speakers, soundbars, and other home theater devices, so headphones seem to be a logical next step for the company. As Sonos manufactures higher-end devices, the first headphones could perhaps be designed to compete with over-ear headphones from companies like Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, Shure, and Bowers &amp; Wilkins, but Sonos could also target the AirPods market.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-24/sonos-is-said-to-plan-headphones-in-move-outside-the-home">in 2019</a> said that Sonos was targeting a &#36;300 price point and was focusing on features like audio quality and multi-service interoperability, but it has been several years since new details emerged.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos speakers already compete with Apple's speakers, so a set of heaadphones that serve as an alternative to &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; and Beats would not be a surprise. At this point, little is known about Sonos' plans for the headphones, and there is no specific launch date that has been shared.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/sonos-new-product-category/">Sonos Announces Plans to Enter Major New Product Category, Likely Headphones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-announces-plans-to-enter-major-new-product-category-likely-headphones.2411202/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week, Amazon introduced the first major discounts on the Apple Watch Series 9. Today, these deals have returned and offer some of the best Black Friday deals around with &#36;50 off nearly every Series 9 device, starting at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5R8BP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;349.00</strong></a> for the 41mm GPS model, down from &#36;399.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-series-9-black-friday.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921790" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the Series 9 models back in September, and early on the steepest discounts were about &#36;10-15. Amazon's Black Friday deals are blowing those early markdowns out of the water, and they include both GPS and cellular models. This time around, the 41mm GPS device is available in two Aluminum models, as well as in both S/M and M/L fits.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5R8BP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm GPS) for &#36;349.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Amazon also has the 45mm GPS Apple Watch Series 9 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXF9R4Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;379.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;429.00. It's available in four Aluminum color options, both S/M and M/L fits, and this is another record low price on the smartwatch.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXF9R4Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm GPS) for &#36;379.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Cellular Apple Watch Series 9 deals are just as abundant on Amazon right now. You can get the 41mm Cellular model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX94FM3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;449.00</strong></a> and the 45mm Cellular model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX3T2TM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;479.00</strong></a>, both of which are &#36;50 discounts and all-time low prices. You'll find all five Aluminum options on sale at these prices, as well as multiple size options.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX94FM3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm Cellular) for &#36;449.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is continuing to run into troubles in its attempt to develop a 5G modem to replace Qualcomm's 5G modems in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and other products, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/apple-project-to-replace-modems-made-by-qualcomm-falls-further-behind-to-2026">reports <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/5G-Modem-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886940" /><br/>
Apple in 2019 acquired the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/">majority of Intel's smartphone business</a> and started in on a serious effort to develop its own modem hardware, but the project has suffered multiple setbacks. Apple is still "years away" from creating a chip that is able to perform as well as or better than chips from rival Qualcomm.<br/>
<br/>
The Cupertino company initially wanted to have an in-house modem chip ready to go by 2024, a goal that could not be met, and now Gurman says that Apple is also going to miss an extended spring 2025 launch timeline. As of now, the modem chip launch has been postponed until the end of 2025 or early 2026, and Apple is still planning to introduce the technology in a version of the low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Development on a modem chip is said to be in the early stages, and it "may lag behind the competition by years." One version in development does not support faster mmWave technology, and Apple has also run into issues with the Intel code that it has been working with. Rewrites have been required, and adding new features has been causing existing features to break, plus Apple has to be careful not to infringe on Qualcomm patents while developing the chip.<br/>
<br/>
"Why we thought we could take a failed project from Intel and somehow succeed is a mystery," an Apple employee allegedly told Gurman. Apple's hardware technologies group is also said to be "stretched thin" across numerous projects, leading to difficulty resolving bugs. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's dissatisfaction with Qualcomm surfaced in 2017, which is when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/">Apple sued Qualcomm</a> for unfairly collecting royalties for technologies it had nothing to do with. Apple was of the opinion that Qualcomm was charging too much for its modem chip technology.<br/>
<br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 lineup, Apple was able to opt out of using Qualcomm chips, instead equipping iPhones with chips from Intel, but the relationship between Intel and Apple was short lived. After the launch of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11, Apple wanted to continue to use Intel chips for its first 5G iPhones, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 models, but Intel could not manufacture 5G chips that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/03/intel-delays-5g-iphone-2020/">were up to Apple's standards</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was instead forced to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/">settle its legal dispute</a> with Qualcomm, and all litigation was dropped. The two companies signed a new contract, which was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/apple-extends-deal-with-qualcomm-as-modem-delayed/">extended in September 2023</a>. The latest deal with Qualcomm covers smartphone launches in 2024, 2025, and 2026, and will last through Apple's delayed modem chip development.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple's in-house modem chip has been delayed, the company is continuing development because it is eager to end its expensive deal with Qualcomm. Apple's first modem chip will be a standalone chip, but the company hopes to eventually develop a system-on-a-chip that will also cut out suppliers like Broadcom and give it more control over component development.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/">Apple&#039;s In-House 5G Modem Work Faces Further Delays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-in-house-5g-modem-work-faces-further-delays.2411187/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The way vehicles take advantage of new connectivity standards could be improving in the near future, leading to updates on how smartphones like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> control cars.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/bmw-car-key-photo.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-778616" /><br/>
This month, the Car Connectivity Consortium (CCC) and the FiRa Consortium that oversees the development of the Ultra-wideband (UWB) standard, <a href="https://carconnectivity.org/car-connectivity-consortium-and-fira-consortium-partner-on-uwb-technology-used-in-the-ccc-digital-key/">announced a partnership</a> for the future development of UWB features used for the CCC Digital Key function.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is a member of both the CCC and FiRa. The CCC's Digital Key specification has been adopted by Apple for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carkey/">Car Keys</a> feature that allows the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the Apple Watch to unlock compatible vehicles over NFC. Select BMW, Kia, Hyundai, Mercedes, and Genesis vehicles <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/">work with Car Keys</a>, but Apple undoubtedly wants to expand adoption.<br/>
<br/>
The CCC and FiRa Consortiums will work together to "develop and maintain" the UWB technology specifications used for the Digital Key standard that serves as the basis for &zwnj;Car Keys&zwnj; on Apple devices. Apple engineer Jinjing Jiang will oversee the joint effort.<br/>
<br/>
The partnership is expected to encourage broader adoption of UWB technology use in vehicles. As of now, UWB is used for the Digital Key standard to relay how close a user is to their vehicle, allowing a smartphone or wearable to be used for vehicle access or to start the car when at the appropriate range.<br/>
<br/>
Apple uses UWB for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Apple Watch, and AirTag. UWB enables more precise location awareness and it powers features like Precision Finding for the AirTag.<br/>
<br/>
Along with Apple, CCC members include most vehicle manufacturers like Ford, BMW, GM, Honda, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and more, while FiRa members include Apple, Google, Qualcomm, Cisco, Samsung, NXP, and more.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/digital-car-key-ultra-wideband-improvements/">Digital Car Key and Ultra Wideband Groups Team Up for Future Apple Car Keys Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/digital-car-key-and-ultra-wideband-groups-team-up-for-future-apple-car-keys-improvements.2411182/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After years of persuading from Google, Apple plans to adopt the Rich Communication Services (RCS) standard. An Apple spokesperson told <em><a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/breaking-apple-will-support-rcs-in-2024">TechRadar</a></em> and <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/16/apple-rcs-coming-to-iphone/">9to5Mac</a></em> that support for RCS will be coming next year.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mz_44PZ-0Js" title="No More Green Bubbles? Apple Officially Announces RCS Support!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
<blockquote>Later next year, we will be adding support for RCS Universal Profile, the standard as currently published by the GSM Association. We believe the RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS. This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users.</blockquote><br/>
According to Apple, RCS will "work alongside iMessage" and will improve communication between <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Android users. iMessage will continue to be the default for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; communication, with RCS serving as a replacement for the existing SMS and MMS standards. SMS and MMS will remain available as a fallback when necessary, though.<br/>
<br/>
Rich Communication Services is a communication protocol adopted by Google. Smartphone makers and carriers worldwide have adopted RCS, but Apple has been resisting its adoption. Google has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/google-ipager-ad-rcs-apple/">pushing Apple to accept RCS</a> through a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/02/google-again-pushes-apple-to-adopt-rcs/">long-running ad campaign</a> involving billboards, a website, social media pressure, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Google has had a "Get the Message" website <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/09/android-website-rcs-apple/">since August 2022</a>, with the site calling on Apple to "fix what's broken" in texts between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android users. Earlier this year, even Samsung got into the PR campaign, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/samsung-pushes-apple-to-adopt-rcs/">publishing a bizarre ad</a> where "Romeo" with his green bubbles and "Juliet" with her blue bubbles were unable to be together because of Apple's hesitation to adopt RCS.<br/>
<br/>
"Green bubbles and blue bubbles want to be together," read Samsung's ad, which also included the #GetTheMessage hashtag Google used for its social media push.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to MMS and SMS, the standards that Apple uses for text messages, RCS supports higher resolution photos and videos, audio messages, and bigger file sizes. It also adds improved encryption for chats between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android users, cross-platform emoji reactions, and more reliability for group chats across different devices.<br/>
<br/>
With RCS, real-time typing indicators, read receipts, better photos and videos, and much improved group chats will be standard on iPhones and Android phones, putting an end to the frustration that some &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users experience when attempting to communicate with Android smartphone owners. Apple claims that while RCS improves security for cross-device messaging, it is not as secure as iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, RCS will provide users with the option to share their location with others inside text threads over text messages, and like iMessage, RCS will work over Wi-Fi in addition to cellular.<br/>
<br/>
Back in September 2022, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> said that adopting RCS was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/tim-cook-on-ios-rcs-buy-your-mom-an-iphone/">not a priority for Apple</a>. "I don't hear our users asking that we put a lot of energy into that at this point," he said. It is not clear why Apple has changed its stance, but the company is facing regulatory scrutiny over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, iMessage, and other proprietary technologies in multiple countries, so adopting RCS could be seen as a willingness to work with other companies to improve device interoperability.<br/>
<br/>
The European Union, for example, has been working on legislation that would have required Apple to make changes to iMessage to make it available on other platforms. With RCS, iMessage will no longer have as many benefits that are unavailable cross-platform.<br/>
<br/>
Going forward, Apple plans to work with Google and other Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) members on further improving RCS. RCS support will be introduced in a software update next year, and carriers will need to implement support for full functionality. In the United States, Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&amp;T already support RCS.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">Apple to Adopt RCS Messaging Standard for Better Interoperability With Android Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard-for-better-interoperability-with-android-devices.2411170/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest flagship iPhones are not charging as expected in some GM vehicles, according to a number of consumer complaints highlighted by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23963780/iphone-15-wireless-charging-gm-chevy-buick-cadillac">The Verge</a></em>. On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoltEV/comments/178mqp9/iphone_15_max_pro_wireless_charging_doesnt_work/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255233412">Apple's site</a>, and other forums, there are reports from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> users who own Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Buick vehicles with wireless chargers that are not able to charge their new iPhones. Some people see the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> charge for a few seconds, but then it seems to stop, while others can't get their devices to charge at all.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-wireless-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1005" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-788160" /><br/>
On Reddit, there are several complaints from Chevy owners who can't get their wireless chargers to work properly. Placing the device in the wireless charging cubby does not result in a charge, regardless of whether the device is in a case.<blockquote>Happy to know that it isn't just me. My iPhone 12 Pro Max worked perfectly (every time) in my '23 Chevy Traverse. I went to the iPhone 15 Pro Max about 6 weeks ago and the feature broke just as described in other comments: Charge for a few seconds and then stops - case on or off yields same results. I am currently on iOS 17.1.1 and have taken every update since the phone was purchased on 10/8/23.</blockquote>Many of the complaints are from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max users, and the problem may be linked to the iOS 17.1 update.<br/>
<br/>
Some in-car wireless chargers are notoriously unreliable because of they are designed for a range of smartphone sizes and sometimes cannot accommodate larger devices. Alignment issues are common, resulting in a lot of frustration when it comes to wireless car charging.<br/>
<br/>
General Motors told <em>The Verge</em> that it is "aware of the concern" and "is investigating," with nothing to confirm on the issue at this time.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second charging-related issue that is plaguing the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models. Following the release of the new devices, some BMW owners quickly found that wireless chargers in their vehicles were temporarily disabling the NFC chip in their iPhones. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/">confirmed the issue in October</a> and introduced a fix <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/">in the iOS 17.1.1 update</a> that came out in early November.<br/>
<br/>
The launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/first-qi2-wireless-chargers-coming-soon/">Qi2 wireless charging standard</a> may cut down on future problems with in-car charging because Qi2 chargers include magnetic alignment, but it often takes car manufacturers many months or even years to introduce new technology, and it won't be helpful to vehicle owners with existing Qi chargers.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the charging issues that GM owners are experiencing seem to have popped up with iOS 17.1, Apple may be able to address the problem with a subsequent update, and there is also a chance that GM can issue a firmware update to restore charging capabilities. As of now, the iOS 17.2 update does not fix the problem.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-15-gm-charging-issue/">Some iPhone 15 Owners With GM Cars Experiencing Wireless Charging Issues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-iphone-15-owners-with-gm-cars-experiencing-wireless-charging-issues.2411168/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-black-friday-shopping-event-gift-cards/">Black Friday bonus gift card announcement</a>, Apple has also released its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/holiday-shipping">holiday shipping guide</a> in the United States and other countries that outlines deadlines for customers looking to order gifts online for arrival by December 24.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-holiday-deadlines-2023.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922847" /><br/>
Unlike in some recent years, Apple appears to have ample stock of all of its main products as we head into the holiday season, with Apple currently saying that most products can be ordered up until December 21 while still receiving delivery in time for Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
For items that can be engraved through Apple, two additional days are generally required, meaning orders must be placed by December 19. The lone exception to that is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>, which must be ordered by December 12 if you wish to have them engraved. Finally, physical gift cards must be ordered by December 19.<br/>
<br/>
While these deadlines are for shipments of orders placed through Apple's online store, the company says customers may still be able to get orders in time after the deadline if items are in stock and customers choose Apple Pickup or 2-hour delivery from a local <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Deadlines in other countries vary somewhat, such as a flat December 21 deadline for all products (including engraved ones) in <a href="https://www.apple.com/de/shop/gifts/holiday-shipping">Germany</a> and a flat December 22 deadline in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/gifts/holiday-shipping">United Kingdom</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple may update the deadlines on these pages in the coming weeks as it assesses product availability, so it pays to keep an eye on it and ensure you order in plenty of time to receive your items in time for the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/03/apple-2023-holiday-return-policy/">extended return policy</a> is also now in effect, allowing items purchased in most countries between November 3 and December 25 to be returned through January 8, 2024. Select countries have a longer window with items purchased between November 4 and January 6 able to be returned through January 20, 2024.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-holiday-shipping-deadlines-2023/">Apple Shares Deadlines for Ordering Holiday Gifts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-deadlines-for-ordering-holiday-gifts.2411158/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 16 Rumored to Feature New Thermal Design</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to introduce a new thermal system on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> to reduce overheating, according to the leaker known as "Kosutami."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-Updated-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-922680" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/KosutamiSan/status/1724948467473408101?s=20">recent post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Kosutami explained that Apple is working on a graphene thermal system for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup, while the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models could add metal battery casings to reduce overheating. The move appears to come in response to widely encountered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">overheating issues</a> experienced with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, which Apple addressed through a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">software update</a> earlier this year. <br/>
<br/>
Graphene has high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper, which is currently used in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> heat-sinks. Apple has been interested in graphene for thermal management for some time, filing patents related to its exploration of the material for heat dissipation in portable devices. Apple previously transitioned the Apple Watch's battery from black foil casings to ones made of metal with the Series 7, so an equivalent change on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; seems plausible.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">iPhone 16 Rumored to Feature New Thermal Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-rumored-to-feature-new-thermal-design.2411142/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft is launching a "<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-app/overview">Windows App</a>" that can remotely connect to a Windows PC and provide access to it from any platform. Available for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, PCs, and web browsers, the app also provides a gateway to Windows 365, Azure Virtual Desktop, Microsoft Dev Box, and the company's Remote Desktop Services.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/windows-app-overview.jpg" alt="" width="1782" height="1101" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922802" /><br/>
The Windows app includes a customizable Home Screen from which users can access multiple different cloud services and remote PCs. The app features multiple monitor support, custom display resolutions, dynamic display resolutions and scaling, peripheral redirection, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft has offered the Remote Desktop Connection app in Windows for years now, but the Windows app signals a broader shift to cloud computing for Windows more generally.<br/>
<br/>
For now the app is only available as a preview for enterprise accounts, but it is likely to support regular customers in time, although the option to sign in using a personal Microsoft account doesn't currently work, according to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23963568/microsoft-windows-app-ios-ipados-macos-web">The Verge</a></em>. The Mac version requires macOS 12 or later, while the iOS/iPadOS app needs a device running iOS or iPadOS 16 or later. The web version of the app can be accessed by going to <a href="http://windows.cloud.microsoft">windows.cloud.microsoft</a>. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows-365/">Windows 365</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/microsoft-windows-app-access-any-device/">Microsoft &#039;Windows App&#039; Offers Access to Windows PCs From Any Device</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-windows-app-offers-access-to-windows-pcs-from-any-device.2411141/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2023/11/new-apple-pay-feature-helps-users-access-account-information-more-conveniently/">highlighted</a> the ability in iOS 17.1 for UK users to connect their credit and debit cards in Apple Wallet and easily access information like account balance, spending history, and more. <br/>
<br/>

Users can view their up-to-date bank card balance, payments, deposits, and withdrawals in Wallet and when they're checking out with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> online or in-apps. Apple says the new feature "empowers users to make more informed purchases, increases their confidence when making a transaction, and allows them to simply view frequent information so that they have more control when it comes to their finances."<br/>
<br/>
From Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2023/11/new-apple-pay-feature-helps-users-access-account-information-more-conveniently/">press release</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>"By enabling users to conveniently access their most useful account information within Wallet and at the time of their purchase, they can make informed financial decisions and better understand and manage their spend," said Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. "We look forward to working with U.K. partners under the Open Banking initiative to help users better their financial health, and provide more ways in which banks can deepen their relationships with customers."</blockquote>Apple added the transaction and card balance functionality to the Wallet app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">October's iOS 17.1 update</a> as part of its Connected Cards feature, and several banks have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/more-uk-banks-show-account-balance-apple-wallet/">since come on board</a>, including Barclays, Barclaycard, First Direct, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds, M&S Bank, Monzo Bank, NatWest Bank, and Royal Bank of Scotland.<br/>
