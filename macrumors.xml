		<description><![CDATA[Apple is believed to be working on a new full-sized <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> that features a touchscreen display for the first time. The device is rumored to launch as soon as the first half of this year, so here's everything we know about it so far.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Second-Generation-HomePod-With-Top-LCD-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931490" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> reporter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> was first to suggest in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/">2021</a> that Apple is working on new HomePods with displays and cameras. The &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;'s OS is now built upon tvOS, and it appears that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/">groundwork</a> for a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a screen has been slowly laid in the background for some time.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Design and Functionality</h3><br/>
The first specific report of Apple's intention to launch a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">new HomePod model with a display</a> came from Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> in March 2023. He said the device will feature a 7-inch display supplied by China's Tianma. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">More details on HomePod B720<br>Same panel size and same design with HomePod 2. Screen were bit curved, looks great after got assembled.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#appleinternal</a> <a href="https://t.co/z8mYgeI3O2">pic.twitter.com/z8mYgeI3O2</a></p>&mdash; Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1739573100604477766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
In October 2023, the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>" shared information about an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/21/images-show-new-homepod-with-screen/">HomePod model with an LCD display</a>. The device will purportedly feature a virtually identical design to the second-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, but with a large LCD touch screen at the top instead of the LED array used on all &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; models to date.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/homepod-b720.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928024" /><br/>
This report was subsequently corroborated by other sources, which added that the model is in active development under the codename "B720". Code in tvOS 17 apparently suggests that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> are among the first apps being rewritten to be compatible with the new display, which will show a blurred animation based on the colors of the album art when a song or podcast is playing. The screen could also potentially show important notifications. <br/>
<br/>
In December, Kosutami <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/future-homepod-to-add-curved-lcd-display/">shared further images</a> of the prototype device, showing a curved, convex LCD screen to display content at the top.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Chip</h3><br/>
There is also the potential for a new chip. The 2023 &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; contains the S7 chip, the same chip used in 2021's Apple Watch Series 7. Despite the introduction of the S8 chip in late 2022 in the Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Ultra, and second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, Apple elected to use the S7 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/s9-chip-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1501" height="844" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913379" /><br/>
Apple's latest Apple Watch models feature the S9 chip, which is significantly more capable than all of its predecessors because it is based on the A15 Bionic. Many <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> requests are processed locally, meaning that responsiveness could benefit from an improved chip. The S9 could also open the ability for health and fitness-related enquiries, but the exact chip the device will use is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Additional Features</h3><br/>
The next-generation ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌'s display could facilitate deeper integration with Apple's other hardware products, Kuo believes. For example, a new &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; could conceivably introduce a lower-latency Handoff experience with the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It could also tout improved audio hardware and microphones, as well as specification upgrades like Wi-Fi 6E support.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Release Date</h3><br/>
In his original March 2023 report, Kuo said that the new &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; would launch in the first half of 2024. There are no concrete rumors about any other new full-sized HomePods at the current time. Meanwhile, Kuo said that Apple will begin mass shipments of the second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/homepod-mini-2-shipping-next-year/">in the second half of 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if the touchscreen &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; will be a direct replacement for the second-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or a new, high-end offering in the lineup, but it may not be long before we know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
In the long term, Apple is believed to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/08/apple-engineers-pessimistic-apple-tv-strategy/">rethinking its smart home strategy</a> and is reportedly working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-in-development/">combined Apple TV and HomePod device</a>, as well as a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a screen <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/">mounted on a robotic arm</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/27/touchscreen-homepod-everything-we-know/">Apple&#039;s Touchscreen HomePod Coming This Year: Everything We Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-touchscreen-homepod-coming-this-year-everything-we-know.2417575/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is sending out push notifications to Apple Savings account holders letting them know about yet another rate increase. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> Savings Account APY is now at 4.50%, up from 4.35%.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892213" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
This is the third APY rate increase the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; Savings Account has seen since December. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/apple-savings-4-25-interest-rate/">first increase</a> brought it from 4.15% to 4.25%, and the second, which happened <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-card-savings-account-apr-increase/">in early January</a>, increased it from 4.25% to 4.35%.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's prior rate increase put it on par with the APY offered by many other popular high-yield savings accounts from American Express and Discover, and with the newest hike, the Apple Savings Account also matches the APY of Marcus by Goldman Sachs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple has once again raised their savings account interest rate from 4.35% to 4.50%! <a href="https://t.co/59dDP502us">pic.twitter.com/59dDP502us</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1751080572452012510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple's high-yield savings account has been available to U.S. &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; holders since April 2023, and it is offered in partnership with Goldman Sachs.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users are able to earn interest on their automatic Daily Cash deposits and also personal funds that are added to the account.

		<description><![CDATA[When the Vision Pro launches, it will not feature some popular apps like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/netflix-wont-offer-vision-pro-app-at-launch/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/youtube-spotify-vision-pro/">YouTube</a>, or Spotify, with users instead relegated to accessing these services through the Safari web browser on the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-4.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884794" /><br/>
In an interview with <em><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-netflix-co-ceo-greg-peters-about-strategy-and-execution/">Stratechery</a></em>, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters explained earlier this week that Netflix does not plan to develop a Vision Pro app at this time because the device is "so subscale" that it is "not really particularly relevant" to most Netflix members.<br/>
<br/>
Peters said that Netflix needs to be careful about how money is spent, ensuring that resources are not invested in areas that will not yield a return.<br/>
<blockquote>You got to a good one really quick there already. Not by any unwillingness or lack of desire to do that, but even when you note we look at as close to ubiquity on devices perspective, the decisions that lead to that are we try and be very rigorous about, "What's the effort to integrate on any given set of devices and what's the benefit for the members that we serve?". We have to be careful about making sure that we're not investing in places that are not really yielding a return, and I would say we'll see where things go with Vision Pro. Certainly we're always in discussions with Apple to try and figure that out but right now, the device is so subscale that it's not really particularly relevant to most of our members.</blockquote><br/>
Peters implied that Netflix is not ruling out a future Vision Pro app. "We've always had active discussions to how we could help each other out," he said about Apple. "Sometimes we find a great space of overlap. We can move very, very quickly. Sometimes it takes a little longer."<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro is priced at &#36;3,500, which puts it out of range of many of Apple's customers, and Apple is manufacturing a limited number of the devices in 2024, according to rumors. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-already-sold-up-to-180000-vision-pros/">recently said</a> that Apple sold between 160,000 to 180,000 units when pre-orders launched, and that the company will only ship around 500,000 units for the year.<br/>
<br/>
Despite early demand, Kuo said that the Vision Pro is "still a very niche product," a view that appears to be shared by some notable companies not creating apps for the device.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro is able to run <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> apps with little to no effort from developers, but Netflix has opted not to allow the Netflix &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app to be available on the headset. Peters did not explain why. Instead, Netflix subscribers will need to watch Netflix through the Vision Pro web browser.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/netflix-vision-pro-not-relevant/">Netflix Not Developing App for Vision Pro Because Headset is &#039;Subscale&#039; and &#039;Not Relevant&#039; to Subscribers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-not-developing-app-for-vision-pro-because-headset-is-subscale-and-not-relevant-to-subscribers.2417554/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.4 beta that Apple seeded to developers yesterday introduces <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">major app ecosystem changes</a> in the European Union, but there are also a handful of other features that have been overshadowed. Once such new addition is a transcript option in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> app, which is similar to the lyric feature in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/podcast-app-transcript.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932875" /><br/>
Recent uploads in the Podcasts app have a new transcript icon, and if tapped, it shows a full transcript of the entire podcast. As with &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, the transcript scrolls as the episode plays.<br/>
<br/>
Transcripts are automatically generated, but appear to be fairly accurate. The transcripts take just a few seconds to generate when a new podcast is played, so they can be useful for determining whether the content in a show is something worth the time to listen to. Searching for a specific word or phrase is supported, and tapping on that word or phrase jumps to that spot in the episode.<br/>
<br/>
Note that not all podcast episodes have transcripts right now, but Apple says that transcripts for back catalog episodes are being added over time. Transcripts are available in English, French, German, and Spanish, and podcast hosts also have the option to upload their own transcripts rather than using the automatically generated version.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 is available to developers at the current time, and Apple plans to release it to the public in March. Other features include sweeping updates in Europe, hints of new features coming to the updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> experience, and more, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1-changes/">details available in our iOS 17.4 beta 1 feature guide</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/ios-17-4-podcast-transcripts/">iOS 17.4 Includes Podcast Transcripts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-includes-podcast-transcripts.2417549/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

While support for alternative browser engines sounds like a win for browser companies, Mozilla spokesperson Damiano DeMonte <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052067/mozilla-apple-ios-browser-rules-firefox">told <em>The Verge</em></a> that Firefox is "extremely disappointed" with the way Apple is implementing the feature because it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-eu-app-ecosystem-tidbits/">does not extend to the iPad</a>.<blockquote>"We are still reviewing the technical details but are extremely disappointed with Apple's proposed plan to restrict the newly-announced BrowserEngineKit to EU-specific apps. The effect of this would be to force an independent browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser implementations -- a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear."</blockquote>Firefox uses the Gecko engine and could swap to that on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but it would need to continue using WebKit on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. According to DeMonte, Apple's implementation of the DMA does not give consumers "viable choices" because it makes it "as painful as possible" for companies to provide alternatives to Safari.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/mozilla-on-apple-eu-browser-engine-change/">Mozilla is &#039;Extremely Disappointed&#039; With Implementation of Apple&#039;s EU Browser Engine Change</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mozilla-is-extremely-disappointed-with-implementation-of-apples-eu-browser-engine-change.2417540/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify CEO Daniel EK <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-26/apples-proposed-changes-reject-the-goals-of-the-dma/">today wrote a blog post</a> criticizing the app ecosystem changes that Apple implemented in the European Union under the Digital Markets Act, accusing Apple of putting forward "a new plan that is a complete and total farce" under "the false pretense of compliance and concessions."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810756" /><br/>
Ek says that Apple doesn't "think the rules apply to them," and he believes that most app developers are not going to be able to adopt Apple's new terms.<br/>
<br/>
The 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee collected per install per year (after 1 million installs) is "extortion," according to Ek. Combined with the reduced commission through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> (10-20% depending on options selected), Ek claims that developers of popular apps will pay "the same or even more to Apple" than with the prior rules.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After sitting with our legal team to parse through the fine print of Apple&#39;s DMA announcement (that took a while), which is, at best vague and misleading, I wanted to share my thoughts.  <br><br>While Apple has behaved badly for years, what they did yesterday represents a new low, even…</p>&mdash; Daniel Ek (@eldsjal) <a href="https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988499518362089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
According to Ek, Spotify is facing "an untenable situation." With Apple's new terms, Spotify would have to pay 0.50 euros per user along with a 17 percent commission, which is the same or worse as under the old rules. Ek claims that an alternative app store offering could potentially increase customer acquisition costs tenfold because of the need to pay the fee even for non-subscribers.<blockquote>And if we managed to remove our app from the App Store and only existed in the Alternative App Store, that would still not work. With our EU Apple install base in the 100 million user range, this new tax on downloads and updates could skyrocket our customer acquisition costs, potentially increasing them tenfold. This, as we have to pay on every install or update to our free or paid app, even for those who no longer use the service.</blockquote>Ek concludes that Apple is "forcing developers to stay with the status quo," which "negates the goal of the DMA." The future that Spotify <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/spotify-shares-vision-iap-eu-regulation/">outlined earlier this week</a> promising a better experience for users in the EU is "less clear," according to Ek, and he calls on European Commissioners to reject Apple's "blatant disregard" of the DMA.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> CEO Tim Sweeney, another outspoken Apple critic, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/fortnite-returning-to-ios-in-europe/">shared similar thoughts yesterday</a>. He said that the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; changes are a "devious new instance of malicious compliance" aimed at thwarting the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
Sweeney said that while Fortnite will return to iOS through a planned &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; app marketplace on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Epic will continue to "argue to the courts and regulators that Apple is breaking the law."<br/>
<br/>
In a statement to <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple said that it is happy to support the success of all developers, and that under the new business terms, more than 99 percent of developers will pay the same amount or less to Apple.<blockquote>We’re happy to support the success of all developers — including Spotify, which has the most successful music streaming app in the world. The changes we’re sharing for apps in the European Union give developers choice — with new options to distribute iOS apps and process payments. Every developer can choose to stay on the same terms in place today. And under the new terms, more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less to Apple.</blockquote><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/spotify-on-apple-eu-app-changes/">Spotify CEO Daniel Ek on Apple&#039;s EU Changes: &#039;They Think the Rules Don&#039;t Apply to Them&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-on-apples-eu-changes-they-think-the-rules-dont-apply-to-them.2417538/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple announced an overwhelming number of changes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">to the app ecosystem</a> in the European Union yesterday, and with the flood of information, there may have been a few details that were overlooked by developers and device users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
We've rounded up a handful of lesser-known details that offer some clarification on what these updates mean for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and other products.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The iPad and Other Devices</h2><br/>
The Digital Markets Act required Apple to make changes to both "iOS" and to the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>," with the European Commission defining iOS as the operating system that runs on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and the "&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;" as a cross-platform entity that operates on all of Apple's operating systems.<br/>
<br/>
For that reason, some of the changes that Apple is making are exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, while others are coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.<br/>
<h3>Limited to the iPhone</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Alternative app marketplaces</strong> - Alternative app marketplaces will only be available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, not the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, so there will not be an option to install a third-party app store on an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. There will also be no way to install an app from an alternative app store on an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. Alternative marketplace apps will be &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; only.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>App notarization</strong> - Notarization is linked to alternative app marketplaces and will apply to iOS apps, not iPadOS apps.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Alternative browser engines</strong> - Allowing browsers to use an alternative engine is a feature that is also &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; only. Chrome, for example, would only be able to use a non-WebKit engine for its Chrome for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; app, not the Chrome for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>NFC access</strong> - Banking and wallet apps on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can access NFC technology and users can set alternative contactless payment apps as default.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>App Store Changes for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Apple's new business terms</strong> - The new business terms, which come with a Core Technology Fee and reduced &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; commissions, are applicable to all platforms.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Third-party payments</strong> - Developers can opt out of In-App Purchases, instead using a third-party payment service provider for digital goods and services.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>App Store labels</strong> - When an app uses alternative payment processing, it will say so on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; product page and on an in-app disclosure sheet that warns customers that a developer is directing them to transact with an alternative payment processor.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Payment link-outs</strong> - Developers can include a link to allow users to complete a transaction on the developer's website, and can also let users know about promotions, discounts, and deals available outside of their apps.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Default App Marketplaces</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Europe can choose to set an alternative app marketplace as the default on their device as required under the DMA. This feature doesn't do much other than show results from the alternative app marketplace in Spotlight search when the search contains something that is available in that marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Marketplace Requirements</h2><br/>
App marketplaces need to provide Apple with proof of solvency in the form of a &#36;1m euro letter of credit. While apps installed through marketplaces do not have to pay a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee for the first 1 million "first installs" of an app, that does not apply to app marketplaces. The fee has to be paid right away.<br/>
<br/>
Developers who want to create an app marketplace need to have a presence in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
App marketplaces only have to pay the Core Technology Fee for app marketplace installs. The fee for individual apps will be paid by those apps, not by the marketplace that they're on.<br/>
<br/>
An app marketplace may not have just a single app in it, because there is a requirement that marketplaces be fair to developers. Marketplaces can set requirements, such as all games or all educational apps, but all apps in that category must be able to apply to be a part of that marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Marketplace Installation</h2><br/>
An app marketplace will be able to be installed as an app through Safari or another web browser, from the app marketplace's developer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Marketplace Limitations and Features</h2><br/>
Marketplace apps are compatible with core iOS features. They will show up in Spotlight, can work with most Screen Time features, and are included in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> backups.<br/>
<br/>
Screen Time purchase restrictions will not be available for app marketplace apps, nor will Family Purchase Sharing or universal purchase.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will not market alternative app stores, or present them as options to users. Developers will need to create their own audience for their marketplaces. Apple also will have no say in refunds or subscription management tools, as the user must go to the marketplace for these options.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Managing Alternative Marketplace Apps</h2><br/>
If an alternative marketplace app is deleted from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, the apps that were installed through that marketplace won't be able to be updated until the marketplace is reinstalled.<br/>
<br/>
Users will be able to see which marketplace an app was downloaded from in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Adopting Apple's New Business Terms</h2><br/>
Developers who opt in to Apple's new business terms, including the Core Technology Fee and reduced commissions, cannot go back to the prior system. It is a one-time change.<br/>
<br/>
Agreeing to the new business terms is done on a per-account level, not per-app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Notarization and Review</h2><br/>
While Notarization will scan for malware, viruses, and ensure that an app does what it says it does, Apple will have less control over content. Copyright violations, IP theft, and other violations will need to be reported to individual app marketplaces, not to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>TestFlight</h2><br/>
Developers can use TestFlight to test an app that is being developed for an alternative marketplace, even if that app will not be distributed through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>NFC</h2><br/>
The NFC changes apply to countries in the European Economic Area, not just EU countries. The European Economic Area also includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, countries that are not in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.lululook.com/">Lululook</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 45mm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and one of <a href="https://www.lululook.com/collections/apple-watch-bands">Lululook's Apple Watch bands</a> to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-sport-orange.jpg" alt="" width="1295" height="728" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933157" /><br/>
Lululook makes a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dlululook%26amp%3Bref%3Dnb_sb_noss">range of accessories</a> for Apple devices, including multiple Apple Watch bands that work with all of the available Apple Watch models. For those who are looking for a more stylish alternative to Apple's Sport Band, Lululook has <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-iWatch-Original-Wristband-Replacement%2Fdp%2FB0CQY562ZJ%3F">the FKM Sport Band</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-fkm-bands.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933163" /><br/>
Priced at &#36;50, the FMK Sport Band is made from a soft silicone material that's water and sweat resistant. It has a matte finish for a soft, plush feel that makes it comfortable to wear all day, and Lululook says that the design is breathable, lightweight, and irritation-free.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-sport-band-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933158" /><br/>
Compared to other silicone bands on the market, the FMK band is made from a denser material that gives it more pliability, and the wave design is meant to give it a unique look that transitions from workouts to the office. The band uses a pin-and-tuck closure that ensures it remains secured on the wrist. Lululook offers this band in multiple fun colors, including forest green, bright yellow, gray, black, blue, orange, and glow-in-the-dark.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-silicone-band-green.jpg" alt="" width="853" height="583" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933164" /><br/>
For those who prefer metal bands, Lululook has quite a few options. The <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Compatible-Stainless-Magnetic-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0CL68P27B%2F%3Fth%3D1">&#36;25 Modern Milanese Loop</a> is an alternative to Apple's own Milanese band, and it is made from a mesh stainless steel with a wrap design. It comes in several colors, including black, silver, gold, rose gold, and starlight. The band is designed to be thin, cutting down on weight and making it comfortable to wear.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-milanese-modern.jpg" alt="" width="1308" height="736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933159" /><br/>
The &#36;24 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Compatible-Stainless-Magnetic-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0CKYJZ5B9%2F">Retro Milanese Loop</a> is similar to the Modern version, but it has a more classic watch design. This model is limited to black and silver, but it has the same lightweight build and magnetic wrap closure for easy removal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-milanese-retro.jpg" alt="" width="1313" height="739" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933160" /><br/>
The &#36;35 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Needed-Compatible-Stainless-Ultra2%2Fdp%2FB0CL68KRZM%2F%3Fth%3D1">Stainless Steel Band</a> is an alternative to Apple's expensive Link Bracelet. There are four to five removable links on each side depending on the size of the band, which allows it to be quickly adjusted to an appropriate size. Links can be removed by hand without a tool, and there's a simple but secure magnetic buckle that keeps it on the wrist.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-link-band.jpg" alt="" width="1309" height="736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933161" /><br/>
All of Lululook's bands work with any modern Apple Watch model, and Lululook often has deals so it's worth checking in every now and then if you're in need of a new watch band.<br/>

The feature was tipped to us by <a href="https://twitter.com/hiddecollee7">Hidde Collee</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>, and Benjamin Xing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933114" /><br/>
This feature allows family and friends to control the music that is playing on your HomePod or Apple TV with permission. For now, this is limited to the Music app, but the other people do not need to have an Apple Music subscription in order to participate.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already rolled out a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/whats-new-carplay-ios-17/">similar feature for CarPlay</a> last year, allowing anyone in a car to control music playback via SharePlay with permission.<br/>
<br/>
The primary user can decide whether to approve or deny each request.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>HomePod</h2><br/>
While playing a song in the Music app on your iPhone, tap the SharePlay icon at the bottom of the screen to bring up a QR code, which another person can scan with their iPhone or Android smartphone's camera to request access to music playback controls. Even a screenshot of the QR code suffices, allowing you to remotely grant access to people around the world if so desired.<br/>
<br/>
The feature works on both the HomePod and HomePod mini, and we could imagine the QR code eventually being shown on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/homepod-with-screen-delayed-next-year/">long-rumored HomePod with a screen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV</h2><br/>
With the tvOS 17.4 update, the Music app on the Apple TV can also show a QR code on the TV that guests can scan to request access to music controls.<br/>
<br/>
The expansion of this feature to the Apple TV and the HomePod is useful for house parties, allowing everyone to be the DJ.<br/>
<br/>
The first beta versions of iOS 17.4, tvOS 17.4, and HomePod software version 17.4 were made available to developers on Thursday for testing. Apple said iOS 17.4 will be released in March, so we can expect the other updates to launch then too.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shareplay/">SharePlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/">SharePlay Music Control Expanding to HomePod and Apple TV</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/shareplay-music-control-expanding-to-homepod-and-apple-tv.2417520/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/the-macs-40th-birthday-and-apple-car-scaled-back-again/id1602394741?i=1000643090315">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-macintosh-turns-40/">40th anniversary of the Macintosh</a>, some of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/netflix-wont-offer-vision-pro-app-at-launch/">latest controversy</a> surrounding apps for the Vision Pro headset, and the news of Apple's vehicle project yet again being <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-car-scaled-down-2028-launch/">scaled back</a>.<br/>

The original Macintosh, unveiled by Steve Jobs, was a game-changer with its graphical user interface and the introduction of the mouse. We explore how the Macintosh's ease of use and innovative design principles, such as a desktop with icons and the ability to use multiple programs in windows, revolutionized personal computing. Reflecting on the Mac's journey, we delve into the evolution of macOS and its remarkable consistency over the years, and point out some of our personal experiences with the platform.<br/>
<br/>
Shifting gears, we discuss the imminent launch of Apple's Vision Pro headset, examining some of the potential challenges it may face and the reasons behind the absence of certain streaming apps like Netflix. We ponder whether this absence is due to genuine technical hurdles or strategic decisions by these companies.<br/>
<br/>
We then turn to the latest updates and challenges surrounding Apple's electric vehicle project, looking at how the company has reportedly pivoted from its initial ambition for a driverless car to developing a vehicle with more conventional and basic driver-assistance features. As we wrap up, we dive into the broader context of electric vehicles, discussing our wish for Apple's car to offer a fresh perspective, moving beyond Tesla's design approach to introduce more variety to the market.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[This week's deals encompassed a wide array of products, from the all-time lows on the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C and M2 Mac mini, to steep pre-order discounts on the Samsung Galaxy S24 smartphones.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>AirPods Pro</h2><br/>

<br/>
The AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C have been the centerpiece of Apple deals in January, and Amazon continues to offer them for the all-time low price of &#36;189.00, down from &#36;249.00. If you pre-ordered the Apple Vision Pro last week, this version of the AirPods Pro 2 will add lossless audio to the headset.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After updating to iOS 17.4, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1/">currently in beta</a>, iPhone users in the EU will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-eu-ios-17-4/">prompted to choose a default web browser</a> when they first open Safari. In an email today, Apple shared additional details about how this process will work.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933094" /><br/>
Apple said iPhone users in the EU will be presented with a list of the 12 most popular web browsers from their country's local App Store at the time, and noted that the options will be shown in random order for every user.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shared an alphabetical list of the browsers that will currently be shown in every EU country. It is a very long list, so we have elected to highlight browsers that will be shown in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain as examples.<ul><li><strong>France:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Onion Browser, Opera, Private Browser Deluxe, Qwant, and Safari</li><br/>
<li><strong>Germany:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Ivanti Web@Work, Onion Browser, Opera, Safari, and You.com AI Search Assistant</li><br/>
<li><strong>Italy:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Ivanti Web@Work, Onion Browser, Opera, Safari, and You.com AI Search Assistant</li><br/>
<li><strong>Spain:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Onion Browser, Opera, Safari, Vivaldi, and You.com AI Search Assistant</li></ul>There are <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles_en">23 other countries in the EU</a> that this change applies to. Notably, this no longer includes the UK, which withdrew from the EU in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
It has already been possible to change an iPhone's default web browser through the Settings app since iOS 14. Apple has now gone a step further and added the default browser prompt in Safari to comply with new regulations under the EU's Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
In the EU, iOS 17.4 also allows web browsers to use web engines other than Apple's WebKit.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said iOS 17.4 will be released to the public in March.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-explains-ios-17-4-default-browsers-eu/">Apple Further Explains iOS 17.4&#039;s New Default Browser Prompt in EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-further-explains-ios-17-4s-new-default-browser-prompt-in-eu.2417507/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Thursday seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 software updates to developers, and the betas revealed a panoply of changes that will impact users in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Apple implemented several major changes to the way the App Store and apps operate in the EU in order to comply with the DMA. These changes are included in iOS 17.4, but are generally limited to countries that are in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is working towards a March 6 deadline to make the changes live for users who update to iOS 17.4. Below, we've summarized what will change for affected users and the reasons that Apple has offered for said changes, along with some related news.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Alternative App Stores</strong>: App developers in the EU can opt to offer alternative app stores or install their apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">through alternative stores</a>, and Apple has a new fee structure as part of the change. Any developer can create an app marketplace, so long as they meet Apple's criteria for customer experience, fraud prevention, customer support, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Alternative Payment Options</strong>: Apple is allowing apps to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">alternative payment options</a>, and there is no longer a requirement to use in-app purchases. Developers can integrate these into their app, or developers can link out to their websites where users can make a purchase.</li><br/>
<li><strong>App Store Notarization</strong>: Apple has outlined how Apps that are distributed through alternative app stores in EU countries will need to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/alternative-app-store-notarization-process/">submit to a notarization process</a> that's similar to the notarization process for Mac apps. </li><br/>
<li><strong>Screen Time and Refund Limitations:</strong>: Apple says apps distributed through alternative app stores <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/features-unavailable-with-alternative-app-stores/">won't work with some long-standing features</a> like Screen Time, refunds, and in-app purchases, as they do for standard App Store apps.</li><br/>
<li><strong>NFC Third-Party Access</strong>: NFC payments will be available directly in apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-nfc-third-party-apps-eu/">without the need for Apple Pay or the Wallet app</a>, allowing third-party payment services and banks to offer their own tap-to-pay solutions on Apple devices in the European Economic Area.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Default Browser Options</strong>: Users in the EU will be allowed to choose a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-eu-ios-17-4/">new default browser</a> from a list of the most downloaded browsers on iOS devices. Some of the options include Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Hardware and Software Developer Access</strong>: Apple will allows developers of iOS apps distributed in the EU to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-interoperability-request-form/">request additional interoperability</a> with iPhone hardware and software features. Apple says it will evaluate interoperability requests on a case-by-case basis.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Expanded Analytics Availability</strong>: As part of the App Store changes in the EU, Apple is providing all developers worldwide with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-developer-analytics-expansion/">updated analytics information</a>. More than 50 new reports will be available through the App Store Connect API to help developers analyze their app performance.<br/>
<li><strong>Apple's Reasons for Limiting Changes to EU</strong>: In a support document, Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/alternative-app-store-eu-risks/">explained</a> why alternative app stores, alternative payment options, and other updates are being limited to the EU, highlighting risks like fraud, scams, and other privacy threats.</li></ul>As a direct or indirect consequence of the announced changes coming in iOS 17.4, there have also been some other significant developments overnight. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's new EU terms include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-eu-fees-could-bankrupt-app-developers/">Core Technology Fee</a> that some developers have warned could completely bankrupt freemium apps that go viral by charging them astronomical fees. Apple does not charge for the first one million "first annual installs" per iOS account each year, but after that, developers will begin racking up charges. Apple's Core Technology Fee could also be prohibitively expensive for apps like Spotify that have millions of users.<br/>
<br/>
Epic Games says it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/fortnite-returning-to-ios-in-europe/">plans to bring its Epic Games Store to the iPhone and the iPad</a> under Apple's new alternative app store policy in the EU. The Epic Games Store will include popular game Fortnite, which means iPhone and iPad users will be able to install and play the title without having to use a cloud gaming service. Fortnite has been banned from the iOS App Store for the last several years due to the legal dispute between Apple and Epic Games.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-allows-game-streaming-apps-on-app-store/">announced</a> that it will allow streaming game apps on the App Store worldwide. This will mean services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW will be available as standalone iPhone and iPad apps, whereas previously they were only accessible via the web.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BAzqrT_hZwA?si=oMxgS8QR78TTEEhW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Technology companies need to adhere to the EU's DMA regulations by March 6, 2024. iOS 17.4 is currently available as a beta update, and it is set to see a public release in March. Given Apple's concerns over user privacy and security, the company is unlikely to implement similar changes worldwide without being forced to by similar legislation from other countries.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">Here Are All the iPhone Changes Coming to EU Users by March 6</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-the-iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users-by-march-6.2417492/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">updated its website</a> to confirm that the first U.S. vehicle models with next-generation CarPlay support will debut in 2024, but it did not provide a more specific timeframe, or indicate when availability will begin in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927534" /><br/>
In a next-generation CarPlay section of its website, Apple replaced "Vehicle announcements coming in late 2023" with "First models arrive in 2024."<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1/">first beta of iOS 17.4</a> released today references eight new CarPlay apps, as discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributors <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1750666693251051812">Aaron Perris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevemoser">Steve Moser</a>:<ul><li><strong>Auto Settings:</strong> This app will let you manage paired iPhones and adjust vehicle settings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Car Camera:</strong> This app will display the vehicle's rear-view camera feed.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> For electric vehicles, this app will display battery level, charging status, time remaining until the battery is fully charged, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Climate:</strong> This app will provide access to a vehicle's climate controls within CarPlay, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heating system, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Closures:</strong> This app will display if any of the vehicle's doors are opened, and it might also display vehicle warning symbols.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> This app will provide access to FM and AM radio station controls within CarPlay, along with other media options like SiriusXM. It is unclear if SiriusXM will offer satellite connectivity, or remain limited to internet streaming. Users will be able to select from a list of music genres, such as Top 40 and Rock.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Tire Pressure:</strong> This app will display air pressure for each of the vehicle's tires, and provide low pressure, high pressure, and flat tire warnings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Trips:</strong> This app will provide a variety of driving-related data, including the vehicle's average speed, fuel efficiency or energy efficiency, the total time elapsed and distance traveled on a trip, and more.</li></ul>An image uncovered in the iOS 17.4 beta reveals that next-generation CarPlay will likely display a "Goodbye" screen after the driver shuts off the vehicle:<br/>
<br/>

As previously announced by Apple, additional images in the iOS 17.4 beta confirm that users will be able to adjust the theme and color scheme of next-generation CarPlay, including the appearance of the instrument cluster:<br/>

Apple first previewed next-generation CarPlay in June 2022. The interface can be tailored to a specific vehicle model and automaker's brand identity, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed by Aston Martin and Porsche</a> in late December. Aston Martin said it would release its first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay in 2024, including a new model of its high-end DB12 sports car. Porsche did not provide a timeframe or specific details about its own plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Aston-Martin.jpeg" alt="" width="980" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927535" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1540" height="854" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927564" /><br/>
When first announcing next-generation CarPlay, Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Beyond the addition of Aston Martin, it is unclear if this list has changed since that initial announcement.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not indicated if any next-generation CarPlay features will be made available in existing vehicles with classic CarPlay support. Apple said iOS 17.4 will be released in March, so perhaps additional details will be shared around then.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/">Apple Confirms Next-Generation CarPlay Launching in 2024, Reveals New Features in iOS 17.4 Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-next-generation-carplay-launching-in-2024-reveals-new-features-in-ios-17-4-beta.2417478/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced the first betas of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 to developers, bringing some radical updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> in Europe. Most of the big changes will only impact EU users, but there are also updates in the operating system that are available worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In this article, we've rounded up everything new in iOS 17.4 beta 1. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>EU Changes</h2><br/>
Apple implemented several major changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act. These changes are included in iOS 17.4, but are generally limited to countries that are in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833990" /><br/>
<h3>Alternative App Stores and New App Store Terms</h3><br/>
App developers in the EU can opt to offer alternative app stores or install their apps through alternative stores, and Apple has a whole new fee structure that goes along with this change. There's a new business structure that developers can opt in to, which applies to both apps distributed in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and apps that are distributed through alternative means.<br/>
<br/>
App developers using the new system will need to pay a standard fee of 0.50 euros per user per year, with the first million installs offered for free. Apps distributed through alternative app stores will have no commission. Apps distributed through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will pay a reduced 17 percent commission, or 10 percent for those in the small business program or for user subscriptions older than a year.<br/>
<br/>
Developers can choose not to opt in to the new system and can use the existing system with the same 15/30 percent commission that's available elsewhere in the world. Apple has a fee calculator to help developers determine what they'll pay with the existing setup, with the new setup, with the new setup using alternative app stores, and with the new setup using the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Users are able to set their preferred alternative app store as the default app store on their device if desired. EU users will see an option for this in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
There are a huge number of behind-the-scene changes that are enabling this feature in the EU, with updates to all kinds of system messaging. Users in the EU will, for example, get a pop up warning when an app from an alternative app store contains malware, and there are new screens for verifying the information from an alternative app.<br/>
<br/>
A Screen Time setting will allow parents to decide whether their children's devices are able to install apps from alternative app marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Alternative Payment Options</h2><br/>
Apple is also allowing apps to use alternative payment options in their apps, and there is no longer a requirement to use in-app purchase. Developers who distribute apps through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and use an alternative payment option will see a three percent discount in their &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fees.<br/>
<br/>
Developers who distribute through alternative apps and also use an alternative payment option will pay Apple no fees beyond the set 0.50 euro fee per user.<br/>
<br/>
With alternative payments, purchases for digital goods and services can be made directly in an app or a developer can choose to link to their website to have a user make a payment. Apple is requiring developers to use a known, secure payment provider.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Third-Party Browser Updates</h3><br/>
After updating to iOS 17.4, EU users that open Safari will see a pop up that allows them to choose a new default browser option from a list of the most popular browsers on iOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also allowing alternative browser engines, and will not limit browsers like Chrome to the WebKit engine.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>NFC Access</h3><br/>
Third-party payment apps and banks have access to the NFC chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in iOS 17.4, and can offer contactless payments directly on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or the Wallet app in the European Economic Area. Users can set a default contactless payment provider that activates at tap-to-pay terminals or when the Side button on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is pressed twice.<br/>
<br/>
The option for setting a default contactless payment provider is available in the Settings app in the EU, and this section will also provide details on all apps that have requested and been granted contactless payment access.<br/>
<br/>
EU users can also change the default Wallet app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Gaming App Changes</h2><br/>
Streaming game apps are now allowed on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; worldwide, which means services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW can be offered as standalone &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously only allowed cloud gaming services to be offered via the web, but dedicated apps that let users stream games from servers are now permitted.<br/>
<br/>
Mini-app, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins are also now able to use the in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Emoji</h2><br/>
The iOS 17.4 beta adds new emoji characters that include lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-New-Emoji-Feature-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1077" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932812" /><br/>
These emoji are part of the Unicode 15.1 update that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ios-17-future-emoji/">approved in September 2023</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Messaging with Siri</h2><br/>
The Automatically Send Messages setting under <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> & Search has been renamed "Messaging with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;," and there is an option to set &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to read incoming messages in a specific language like Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and many more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-messaging-with-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932819" /><br/>
The change does not update the primary language that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; listens in and responds to, but is limited to message playback.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Podcasts and Music</h2><br/>
The "Listen Now" tabs in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and Podcasts have been renamed to "Home."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-music-home.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932818" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Podcast Transcripts</h2><br/>
The Podcasts app now offers transcripts, similar to how lyrics work in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/podcast-app-transcript.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932875" /><br/>
<h2>Safari</h2><br/>
The URL/search bar in Safari is now wider than it was before.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-wider-safari-url-bar.jpg" alt="" width="2807" height="1579" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932817" /><br/>
<h2>Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
In the Stolen Device Protection section of the Settings app, there is now an option to require a security delay always or only when away from familiar locations. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932874" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
Next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> is set to launch in the U.S. later in 2024, and code in iOS 17.4 references eight new &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; apps. <br/>
<br/>
<li><strong>Car Camera:</strong> This app will display the vehicle's rear-view camera feed.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> For electric vehicles, this app will display battery level, charging status, time remaining until the battery is fully charged, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Climate:</strong> This app will provide access to a vehicle's climate controls within &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heating system, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Closures:</strong> This app will display if any of the vehicle's doors are opened, and it might also display vehicle warning symbols.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> This app will provide access to FM and AM radio station controls within &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, along with other media options like SiriusXM. It is unclear if SiriusXM will offer satellite connectivity, or remain limited to internet streaming. Users will be able to select from a list of music genres, such as Top 40 and Rock.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Tire Pressure:</strong> This app will display air pressure for each of the vehicle's tires, and provide low pressure, high pressure, and flat tire warnings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Trips:</strong> This app will provide a variety of driving-related data, including the vehicle's average speed, fuel efficiency or energy efficiency, the total time elapsed and distance traveled on a trip, and more.</li></ul>An image in iOS 17.4 beta suggests that &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will also likely display a "Goodbye" screen after the driver shuts off the vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Goodbye.jpg" alt="" width="1374" height="484" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932992" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>SharePlay</h2><br/>
SharePlay music control <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/">is expanding</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> with iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4. With the feature, a user's family and friends can control the music that is playing on a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, so long as the user has granted permission.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933114" /><br/>
The person who owns the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; needs to have an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription, but the person who is granted SharePlay access can play music using &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; without a subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Connecting to a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; to use SharePlay can be done by scanning a QR code on the device owner's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (for &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;) or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. Users can connect to a device while in the same space or remotely.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[App developers in the European Union who choose to opt in to Apple's new business terms must pay an €0.50 "<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/">Core Technology Fee</a>" or CTF for every app install over one million installs, a model that has the potential to bankrupt free or freemium app developers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/app-store-fees-eu.jpg" alt="" width="2856" height="1607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932868" /><br/>
Apple does not charge for the first one million "first annual installs" per iOS account each year, but after that, developers will begin racking up charges. A free or freemium app that goes "viral" and is downloaded more than one million times could be forced to pay astronomical fees, as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/111818345294643786">demonstrated in estimates</a> shared by developer Steve Troughton-Smith.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe src="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/111818345294643786/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="400" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://mastodon.social/embed.js" async="async"></script></div><br/>
Under Apple's new business terms, a free or freemium app that gets two million annual "first installs" would need to pay an estimated &#36;45,290 in fees per month according to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/fee-calculator-for-apps-in-the-eu/">Apple's fee calculator</a>, or more than half a million dollars per year, even if no money is earned.<br/>
<br/>
That's an unsustainable model for free apps, and freemium apps would need to be earning at least €0.50 per user to break even with the fee. A freemium app with thousands of installs from non-paying users could end up owing far more than is made. Developers will likely need to charge up front to ensure their apps make enough money to pay the CTF, as offering a free-to-download app could be risky if downloads exceed 1 million.<br/>
<br/>
Free and freemium app developers can, however, choose to stick with Apple's current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> business terms instead of opting for the new terms. In that situation, nothing would change, and app developers would continue to pay a 15 to 30 percent commission to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The €0.50 CTF applies to apps distributed both through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and through alternative app stores if developers choose the new business terms. With the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, developers are charged the €0.50 fee and must pay a 10 to 17 percent commission to Apple. With an alternative app store, there is no commission. Fees can be estimated for the existing terms and the new terms <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/fee-calculator-for-apps-in-the-eu/">through a dedicated calculator</a> that Apple has provided to developers. <br/>
<br/>
Here's a breakdown of the available options:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Current App Store Agreement</strong> - Developers pay Apple a 15 to 30 percent commission. Under one million in revenue is a 15 percent commission through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Small Business Program, over &#36;1 million results in a 30 percent commission. Subscriptions require a 30 percent commission for the first year, and a 15 percent commission for the second year and beyond.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>New terms, App Store distribution</strong> - Commission drops to 17 percent from 30 percent, and 10 percent from 15 percent. There is an additional fee of 3 percent for using Apple's payment system, so the commission would be between 13 and 20 percent for a developer that opts for the new rules and uses in-app purchases. The 3 percent fee does not apply for developers who use alternative payment systems. Developers must also pay €0.50 per app install per user each year after 1 million app installs.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>New terms, alternative app store distribution</strong> - No commission, but developers must pay €0.50 per app install per user annually after 1 million app installs.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
According to Apple, the CTF is applied for the first annual install, which is the first time an app is installed by an account in the EU in a 12-month period. After the first annual install, the app can be installed any number of times by the same account for the next 12 months with no charge.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is waiving the fee for nonprofit organizations, accredited educational institutions, and government entities that are approved for a fee waiver.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Core Technology Fee could also be prohibitively expensive for apps like Spotify that have millions of users. An app that makes &#36;10 million in sales through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; with 10 million "first installs" (aka, a 0.99 price) will need to pay Apple over &#36;500k per month.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Under the App Store&#39;s new fee structure for Europe, if you make &#36;10 million in sales, Apple&#39;s cut is &#36;6.2 million annually.<br><br>Assuming you have no operating costs or salaries, your take home amount: <br>&#36;2 million after tax—or 20% of your sales<br><br>I will never launch an app in Europe. <a href="https://t.co/MUCxVHcHOo">pic.twitter.com/MUCxVHcHOo</a></p>&mdash; Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitabier/status/1750592825060921353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[As part of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> changes being enabled in Europe, Apple is providing all developers worldwide with updated analytics information.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-developer-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757303" /><br/>
More than 50 new reports are available through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect API to help developers analyze their app performance. Some of the new metrics:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Engagement</strong> - Apple is offering additional insight into the number of users on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; that interact with a developer's app or share it with other people.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Commerce</strong> - Developers can get more information on downloads, sales and proceeds, pre-orders, and transactions made with the In-App Purchase system.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>App Usage</strong> - Apple now provides more information on crashes, active devices, installs, app deletions, and more.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Frameworks Usage</strong> - Developers can get info on their app's interaction with iOS features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, and PhotoPicker.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
As it does with current reports, Apple will anonymize the data that is used in the new report options. Developers will be able to grant third-party access to their performance reports.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apps that are distributed through alternative app stores in EU countries will need to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu#ios-app-eu">submit to a notarization process</a> that's similar to the notarization process for Mac apps. According to Apple, Notarization applies to all apps, and it is a process focused on privacy, security, and maintaining device integrity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-app-store-notarization-eu.jpg" alt="" width="2124" height="1195" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932861" /><br/>
Apple is aiming to ensure that apps do not have viruses, malware, or other security threats, and that they function as promised without exposing users to "egregious fraud."<br/>
<br/>
Notarization will check for the following:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - Apps are required to accurately represent the developer, capabilities, and costs to users.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Functionality</strong> - Binaries must be reviewable, free of serious bugs or crashes, and compatible with the current version of iOS. Software or hardware cannot be manipulated in ways that negatively impact the user experience.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Safety</strong> - Apps cannot promote physical harm of the user or public.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Security</strong> - Apps cannot enable distribution of malware, or suspicious or unwanted software. They also cannot download executable code, read outside of the container, or direct users to lower the security on their system or device. Apps also must provide transparency and allow user consent to enable access to the system or device, or to reconfigure the system or other software.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Apps cannot collect or transmit private, sensitive data without a user's knowledge or in a manner contrary to the stated purpose of the software.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The malware and virus portion of the notarization process will be automatic, but there will also be a human review to make sure that apps are functioning as advertised.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to encrypt and sign all iOS apps intended for alternative distribution to ensure that users are getting apps from known parties and to protect developers' intellectual property.<br/>
<br/>
Notarized apps will be double checked during installation to ensure that they have not been tampered with and that installation was initiated through an authorized web browser. An iOS app that is found to have known malware after it's been installed will be prevented from launching on a user's device and new installations will be revoked.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> review process, Notarization will not check apps for quality or content. Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules do not allow for content that is "offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy," and this content guideline will not apply to apps installed through alternative stores.<br/>
<br/>
Information from Notarization will be used for app installation sheets that will be presented to end users. Apple will offer at-a-glance information about apps and their functionality that users can review before deciding to install an app through an alternate app store.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, the Notarization system is aimed at providing "basic protections" that will reduce "some of the new risks" that are created by alternative app distribution. Apple says that it will not set the "same high bar for privacy and security" as the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; review process.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/alternative-app-store-notarization-process/">This is How Notarization Will Work for iOS Apps Distributed Through Alternative App Stores</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/this-is-how-notarization-will-work-for-ios-apps-distributed-through-alternative-app-stores.2417454/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act, Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/ios-interoperability/">introduced</a> a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/interoperability/">request form</a> that allows developers of iOS apps distributed in the EU to request additional interoperability with iPhone hardware and software features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912514" /><br/>
Apple already offers developers more than 250,000 APIs, enabling them to access iPhone features and frameworks such as cameras, microphones, Bluetooth, HealthKit, SiriKit, and much more. Now, developers can request access to additional iPhone features and technologies for use in their apps in the EU, as they see fit.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says it will evaluate interoperability requests on a case-by-case basis, and release additional APIs in future iOS versions as necessary. Apple says requests must be technically feasible and adhere to the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear how many of these requests Apple will approve, if any.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is already making the NFC chip in iPhones <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-nfc-third-party-apps-eu/">accessible to third-party payment and wallet apps</a> in the EU, along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, which will provide users with alternatives to Apple Pay and the Apple Wallet. This change was introduced with iOS 17.4, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">available in beta now</a> and will be released in March.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/interoperability/">request form</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/ios-interoperability/">additional details</a> can be found on Apple's website.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-interoperability-request-form/">Apple Now Allows Developers to Request Access to Additional iPhone Hardware and Software Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-allows-developers-to-request-access-to-additional-iphone-hardware-and-software-features.2417451/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
