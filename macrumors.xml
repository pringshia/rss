		<description><![CDATA[The 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference is coming up quick, with less than a week to go before the big keynote event. We're sharing a series of rumor recaps this week, for those who want to get a sneak peek at some of the features expected in Apple's upcoming software updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iOS-26-Mock-Rainbow-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003293" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> is definitely the OS that we've heard the most about, and rumors suggest that it's going to get a major design overhaul. We've highlighted everything we know below.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Naming</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is not going to iOS 19, with Apple instead opting to change the numbering for its software updates. Instead, we're going to get &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, which will be released alongside iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-19-to-26-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003962" /><br/>
The "26" in the name marks the September 2025 to September 2026 release season for &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. Next year we'll get iOS 27, then iOS 28, and so on. All software updates now share the same year number, which makes it easier to keep new releases straight.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design Updates</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is going to get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">major design revamp</a>, adopting some visual elements from the visionOS operating system. Inside Apple, the design project is referred to as "Solarium," which hints at what we can expect.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-19-visionOS-UI-Elements.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994345" /><br/>
A solarium is an all-glass room that's designed to let in sunlight, and rumors suggest that &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; will adopt a more translucent, glass-inspired aesthetic.<br/>
<br/>
visionOS has a translucent interface to allow people to see their surroundings in AR or VR while also interacting with app menus and windows. visionOS windows blend into the background for an unobtrusive look, and on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple could adopt the same translucent focus to let content shine through.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is also expected to get some of the floating on-screen windows and menus that are used in visionOS, with rounded pop-up navigation and menu bars that float above the content on the display. Apple could use shading, shadowing, and subtle lighting effects to give buttons and other interface elements a slight lift.<br/>
<br/>
App icons could be rounder, and notifications, menus in apps, search bars, card-style interfaces, and other parts of the iOS user interface could have more rounded corners than we're used to. The floating navigation bars are expected to be pill-shaped, for example.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; has been described as having a glossy or glass-like look, which is also how visionOS looks. Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> teaser images feature a frosted glass rainbow with soft colors, and those images might hint at what's coming. Apple could use a soft, frosted glass style across &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Mockups that are allegedly based on real &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; designs were shared earlier this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-19-visionos-like-design-rumors/">by Front Page Tech</a>, demonstrating some of the design changes that might be in store.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985937" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Alleged-iOS-19-Camera-App-Render.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="794" /><em>A render of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;'s alleged redesigned Camera app, from Front Page Tech</em></div><br/>
A mockup of the Camera app, for example, has translucent pop-out menus that better blend into the background to put the focus on the images.<br/>
<br/>
Newer Apple apps like Apple Sports and Invites have simpler, translucent interface elements with expanding buttons, and could also serve as an example of the design language Apple is debuting in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988149" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-invites-screenshots.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple is planning to overhaul its built-in apps with the updated design, though some will get bigger refreshes than others. Apple will also provide developers with design guidelines and assets so that third-party apps can adopt the new aesthetic as well.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Navigation Simplification and Streamlining</h2><br/>
Along with a new look, Apple is also going to streamline navigation options in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. Apple is tweaking menus, buttons, and navigation to make the operating system simpler to learn and navigate.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the design and interface changes will also extend to macOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS, improving design consistency and navigation across Apple's operating systems.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Features</h2><br/>
There are several new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features that are expected in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>AI Battery Management</h3><br/>
An AI-powered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/ios-19-ai-battery-management/">battery management feature</a> will analyze how you use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and make adjustments to maximize battery life. The option will be able to limit the power draw of apps and other system features based on device usage.<br/>
<br/>
Battery management will be particularly useful for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> that will have a smaller battery than other iPhones, but it will be available on iPhones that are able to run &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Shortcuts App</h3><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/shortcuts-app-apple-intelligence-integration/">update the Shortcuts app</a> with &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, allowing users to create actions that use &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; models. With this functionality, Shortcuts could be easier to use, with even casual users able to create useful shortcuts using natural language.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Google Gemini</h3><br/>
Apple and Google are close to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/ios-19-google-gemini-integration-likely/">establishing a deal</a> that will add Google Gemini to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as an alternative to ChatGPT, and that's a feature that we'll likely see in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. Google Gemini would integrate with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> like ChatGPT, with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; able to hand requests over to Gemini for more in-depth AI-powered answers.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Siri</h3><br/>
We're <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-ios-19-siri-delay/">still waiting</a> on all of the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that Apple debuted at WWDC 2024. Those updates are expected to come at some point in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, but they may not be ready for the launch version of the software. If the functionality isn't ready to go, Apple isn't going to mention it at &zwnj;WWDC 2025&zwnj; to avoid further embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what's coming, eventually:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Personal Context</strong> - &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to keep track of everything on your device, like emails, messages, files, and more, helping you complete tasks and find things.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Onscreen awareness</strong> - &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will know what's on your screen and will be able to complete actions involving whatever you're looking at.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Deeper App Integration</strong> - &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do more in and across apps, performing actions and tasks that are not possible with the personal assistant right now. This will be a feature available for Apple's apps and third-party apps.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Gaming App</h2><br/>
Apple has a new gaming app planned, and it'll replace Game Center and add more functionality than ever before. It's going to house the games section of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, so you'll be able to find and launch games from one convenient gaming-centric spot.<br/>
<br/>
The app is also expected to feature communication options for connecting with other players, in-game achievements, editorial content and recommendations, and leaderboards.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Features for Existing Apps</h2><br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that there are several new features coming to existing Apple apps.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> - Automatic translations and support for polls.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Music</strong> - Full screen animated art on the Lock Screen.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Notes</strong> - Markdown support.</li><br/>
<li><strong>CarPlay</strong> - Updated user interface to match &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods Live Translate</h2><br/>
With an AirPods firmware update, an &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; feature will allow the AirPods to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/airpods-live-translation-ios-19/">translate in-person conversations</a> from one language to another. If an English speaker with AirPods is conversing with someone who is speaking Spanish, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will detect the audio, translate the speech, and relay it back in English to the AirPods wearer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Connectivity</h2><br/>
Apple is adding a new feature that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/ios-19-sync-captive-wi-fi-data-between-devices/">will synchronize</a> captive Wi-Fi portal login information across devices, so you'll only need to enter login details for a captive Wi-Fi network once, and it'll be available on all of your Apple products. Captive networks are common in hotels, airports, coffee shops, and other locations with shared or paid internet options.<br/>
<br/>
Apple might also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/ios-19-esim-android-transfer/">make it easier</a> for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to transfer an eSIM to an Android smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Health App</h2><br/>
There's a new Health app coming, but it might not be ready when &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; launches, so Apple might not be planning to unveil it just yet. The revamped app will apparently offer AI-powered health coating features with personalized health recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
There may also be new food tracking functionality that would allow users to keep track of their calorie intake each day.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Stage Manager</h2><br/>
There's a possibility that Apple will add a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/">Stage Manager</a> feature for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models that have a USB-C port, with the feature activating when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is connected to an external display over USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Stage Manager&zwnj; would allow multiple apps to be opened at once, offering a more Mac-like experience when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is used with a display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Accessibility Features</h2><br/>
Apple previewed new Accessibility features coming to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; earlier this year, and there are some interesting new additions.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Music Haptics</strong> - Music Haptics will get customization options so haptics can be enabled for an entire song or just vocals, plus there will be options to adjust the intensity of taps, textures, and vibrations.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>App Store Labels</strong> - &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; product pages will get Accessibility Nutrition Labels that highlight accessibility features in apps.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Accessibility Reader</strong> - Accessibility Reader is a systemwide reading mode that will make text easier to read thanks to customization features for adjusting font, color, spacing, and more.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>CarPlay</strong> - <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> is getting support for Large Text and Sound Recognition that will alert drivers to the sound of a crying baby, horns, and sirens.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Background Sounds</strong> - Background Sounds will be customizable with new EQ settings, timers, and automation actions in Shortcuts.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Personal Voice</strong> - Personal Voice will let users preserve their voice faster and more easily. It will use on-device machine learning to create a smoother, more natural-sounding voice in under a minute.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Tracking</strong> - Head tracking and eye tracking are getting updates, plus Apple is adding support for Brain Computer Interface devices.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>iPadOS 26</h2><br/>
iPadOS 26 is going to get the same design updates that are coming to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, so it will have the same glass-like, translucent look.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/">adding new features</a> that will make the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> experience more like using a Mac, introducing improved productivity, new multitasking features, and expanded window management options.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 26 may have a Mac-like menu bar when connected to a Magic Keyboard, plus Apple is adding a new reed calligraphy pen option for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> users that need to write Arabic script.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Compatibility</h2><br/>
Rumors suggest that &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; will not be available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XR, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS, or the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS Max, but it will run on all other iPhones that support &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus</li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max</li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></li><br/>

 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Plus</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro Max</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 mini</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro Max</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12</li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a></li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro</li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a></li><br/>

 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2nd generation or later)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
While these iPhones will support &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, advanced features may be limited to newer iPhones with faster processors. &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, for example, only runs on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro and the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Read More</h2><br/>
More info on all of the rumored features that we know about so far can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">found in our iOS 26 roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>WWDC 2025 Keynote</h2><br/>
Apple's &zwnj;WWDC 2025&zwnj; keynote will begin on Monday, June 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Apple will live stream the event on its website, on YouTube, and in the TV app.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> Messages app will include a new translate feature, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>. Messages will apparently be able to automatically translate incoming and outgoing messages when you're conversing with someone who speaks another language.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/General-Apps-Messages-Redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985161" /><br/>
You can already long press on an incoming message and choose the translate option to translate it to another language, but it seems the process could be sped up with automatic translation options.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also said to be planning to add an option for a polls in the Messages, which would allow people in group chats to vote. The polls option could be powered by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, with Apple suggesting polling categories.<br/>
<br/>
<em>9to5Mac</em> claims that Apple is also working on several other features:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Music</strong> - Full screen animated art on the Lock Screen.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Notes</strong> - Markdown support.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>CarPlay</strong> - Updated user interface to match &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Airthings is a company known for its air quality sensors, and today it introduced its newest digital radon detector, the <a href="https://www.airthings.com/products/corentium-home-2">Corentium Home 2</a>. Depending on where you live, you may or may not be aware of radon, but exposure to radon over time can lead to lung cancer, and many people aren't aware that there's radon in their homes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/airthings-corentium.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003697" /><br/>
The Corentium Home 2 is a follow up to the original Corentium Home, and while it does not include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, it does have an iOS app that's able to connect to your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> over Bluetooth to deliver regular readings. It monitors radon levels, humidity, and temperature, and can send an alert if levels exceed a set threshold. When a reading is out of range, the display will let you know, so you can open the app to download the data to check in. Wi-Fi would be nice to have for continual data without the need to connect, but so far, the connection and data downloads have been quick and reliable.<br/>
<br/>
Design wise, the Corentium Home 2 is fairly simple. It's made from black plastic, with a small square screen where you can see the radon, humidity, and temperature readings at a glance. There's a button on the front that cycles through each view, and that's about it except for a battery compartment and a button inside the battery compartment that activates Bluetooth. It connects to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; over Bluetooth to sync data to the accompanying app, and the app has the same straightforward design.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004133" /><br/>
The app features current radon, humidity, and temperature levels, along with options to view results over time. Options include 24 hours, seven days, 30 days, and a year. You'll see averages over each time period, but you can also tap into each section for more granular data. When you're viewing data, the app has a neat haptic feature. When you tap along the line graph, rather than just jumping from one spot to another, it will quickly run through the different averages, which is useful for getting an in-depth look in just a few seconds.<br/>
<br/>
The app and the graph use green for "good" radon readings, yellow for readings that exceed the good category, and red for danger zone readings, while it uses the same colors for humidity and adds blue for temperature. The app has built-in thresholds that aren't customizable, but seem to be based on generally accepted ideal indoor radon, humidity, and temperature settings.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004134" /><br/>
As long as radon readings are below 2.7 pCi/L (that's picocuries per liter), the app and the sensor won't raise an alarm. The yellow zone is between 2.7 pCi/L and 4 pCi/L, while the red zone is above 4 pCi/L. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggests that people address radon at levels between 2 pCi/L and 4 pCi/L, with a stronger recommendation at above 4 pCi/L.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-app-interface.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004136" /><br/>
For temperature, the Corentium Home 2 green zone is between 64 and 77 degrees, the red zone is above 77 degrees (aka it's hot), and the blue zone is below 64 degrees (it's cold). Humidity is red above 70 percent and below 25 percent (these extremes are unpleasant for people and for wood floors and items in your home), yellow between 25 and 30 percent and also 60 and 70 percent, and green between 30 and 60 percent. The EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/care-your-air-guide-indoor-air-quality">recommends</a> humidity levels between 30 and 50 for optimal comfort, but the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute <a href="https://www.ahrinet.org/scholarships-education/education-professionals-homeowners/contractors-and-specifiers/hvacr-equipmentcomponents/humidifiers#:~:text=The%20American%20Society%20of%20Heating,living%20while%20preventing%20mold%20growth">recommends</a> between 40 and 60 percent. Drier air can lead to dry mucus membranes and an increase in infections, while moister air can cause mold. Ideals may vary based on climate and personal preference, so I do wish Airthings allowed the thresholds for temperature and humidity to be adjusted if needed.<br/>
<br/>
You can opt in or opt out of alerts for radon, temperature, and humidity. Radon alerts are turned on by default, but can be toggled off in the app's settings, while the other options can be toggled on. Units of measurement can be changed in the app, and there's also an option to check pollen levels if you provide the app with your location.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004135" /><br/>
There are much more affordable temperature and humidity sensors on the market, so most people are likely going to want to pick up the Corentium Home 2 for the radon detection, with temperature and humidity readings serving as a bonus. There are multiple kinds of radon testing. Some are small packets of activated charcoal that you leave in place before sending them off to a lab, while there are also expensive professional level testing machines and mid-tier sensors like the Corentium Home 2.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-temperature-humidity.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004138" /><br/>
The mail-in tests are the most affordable and the professional tests are the most expensive, but neither provides monitoring over time like the Corentium Home 2 does. Radon is a significant enough issue that if you're in an area with radon levels that are known to be high, keeping an eye on radon levels over time can provide peace of mind.<br/>
<br/>
The EPA has a radon zone map [<a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-05/radon-zones-map_text_link.pdf">PDF</a>], and much of the U.S. has high to moderate potential for indoor radon levels over 2 pCi/L. Radon comes from soil, rock, and groundwater, and it can seep into your home without you knowing because it is invisible and has no odor. The EPA estimates that there are 21,000 radon-related lung cancer deaths each year, and there is no established "safe" level of radon exposure. Exposure is continuous even at low levels, and it is the leading cause of lung cancer in people who do not smoke.<br/>
<br/>
I had average radon levels of 5.7 pCi/L in my house, and it sometimes spiked to 8 pCi/L, so I am familiar with radon and radon testing. I have had my home radon tested several times, before and after a radon mitigation system was installed. I don't have a recent professional test (the last was in 2023), but the levels that the Corentium Home 2 show are in line with the results of the post mitigation testing that I had done (below 2 pCi/L on average).<br/>
<br/>
The Corentium Home 2's radon readouts appear to be accurate to me, as are the temperature and humidity sensors. I have several SensorPush sensors that I use regularly and that are calibrated, and the Corentium Home 2 is generally within a percent on both temperature and humidity each time I've checked.<br/>
<br/>
Even with a radon mitigation system, an option to see radon levels continually prevents anxiety over spikes in concentration and settles the question of whether mitigation is working. Radon levels can fluctuate quite a bit depending on outdoor conditions, time of year, and other factors, plus they can vary by room, so the other great thing about the Corentium Home 2 is that you can move it around and make sure there are no hot spots.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/corentium-radon.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004137" /><br/>
Radon monitors are typically placed in the lowest area of the home (that's where the gas settles), and several feet from a door or window that's opened regularly, because that can affect the readout. With the Corentium Home 2, you'll get your first reading within 24 hours, and continual readings after that. You need to test for around 30 days to get a clear picture of radon over time, and data will download from the device to the app each time you open up the app.<br/>
<br/>
If it turns out that you do have a radon issue, the app can provide information on what to do about it. You can also turn on a "Connect with a professional" setting that will automatically contact a local company that deals with radon if you get a high reading, but I think most people are intelligent enough to seek out their own help.<br/>
<br/>
The Corentium Home 2 operates on two AA batteries. I'm not yet sure how long the batteries will last, but AA is a battery type a lot of people keep on hand, and battery use seems minimal given that data is transferred over Bluetooth.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
Most of us have carbon monoxide sensors and smoke detectors in our homes, but radon can be just as dangerous. The Corentium Home 2 is &#36;180, which feels like a reasonable price to pay to be able to keep an eye on radon fluctuations over time.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have a radon mitigation system or aren't familiar with radon, it can let you know if there's a problem. If you do have mitigation already and are aware of an issue, it can let you know that your system is working as intended.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2><br/>
The Corentium Home 2 can be purchased <a href="https://www.airthings.com/products/corentium-home-2">from the Airthings website</a> or <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAirthings-325-Corentium-Digital-Detector%2Fdp%2FB0F84C4ZZM%3F">from Amazon</a> for &#36;180.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/corentium-home-2/">Review: iPhone-Connected Corentium Home 2 Radon Monitor Provides Peace of Mind</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-iphone-connected-corentium-home-2-radon-monitor-provides-peace-of-mind.2458154/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung recently launched the Galaxy S25 Edge, a super thin smartphone that will compete with Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>. To see what it's like using such a thin phone, <em>MacRumors</em> video editor Dan Barbera used it as his main device for two weeks to see what it might be like to use Apple's equivalent later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iPhone User Switches to Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZpfXRCtth8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch display, so it's a larger smartphone, but because it's so thin and light, it's easy to hold. It's just 5.8mm thick and it weighs 163 grams, and it's so light that it almost feels like a plastic dummy phone. Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; could be even thinner at 5.5mm, and it will have a similar display size at 6.6 inches, so it should be a lot like the S25 Edge.<br/>
<br/>
These super thin smartphones need to be used without a case to get the full effect, since a case is just going to increase the weight and thickness. A slim case might not be too bad, but it seems silly to shell out money for a super thin smartphone just to stick it inside a thick case.<br/>
<br/>
With such a thin body, the Galaxy S25 Edge doesn't have as much room for a battery as other Samsung smartphones, so battery life is lacking. It's still possible to get through the day without a charge, but if you're a heavy user, you're probably going to need to top up your battery every so often during the day. Samsung has battery optimization settings that prioritize battery life, but those options affect game performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will likely have some of the same issues with battery life, though optimizations are being implemented through AI battery settings in iOS 19. The efficiency of the C1 modem that the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will use will also help, plus Apple is going to sell an add-on battery pack alongside it.<br/>
<br/>
Camera functionality is a tradeoff on the Galaxy S25 Edge, because it only has the 200-megapixel main lens and a 12-megapixel ultra wide lens with no telephoto lens. Other Samsung devices have triple-lens camera setups. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will suffer from the same issue, and it's only going to get a single-lens main camera due to space constraints.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung is selling the Galaxy S25 Edge for &#36;1,100, which is not too far off from the higher-end and more feature rich Galaxy smartphones. Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; could come in cheaper at around &#36;899, but that pricing plan was before any potential increases due to tariffs.<br/>
<br/>
Do you plan to get the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; this year? How do you think it will measure up to the S25 Edge?

		<description><![CDATA[While the iPhone 17 series is still three months away from launching, rumors about next year's iPhone 18 models continue to surface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-Top-Left-Hole-Punch-Face-ID-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000739" /><br/>
The latest word comes from Apple analyst Jeff Pu. In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu said that he expects the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and so-called iPhone 18 Fold to be equipped with Apple's A20 chip, and he believes the chip will have some key design changes over the A18 and upcoming A19 chips.<br/>
<br/>
First, Pu reiterated that the A20 chip will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process. The current A18 Pro chip in iPhone 16 Pro models is fabricated with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, while the A19 Pro chip for the iPhone 17 Pro models is expected to use TSMC's third-generation 3nm process. The move from 3nm to 2nm starting with the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Fold models would allow for more transistors in each chip, which helps to boost performance. Specifically, previous reports indicated that A20 chips should be up to 15% faster and up to 30% more power efficient than A19 chips.<br/>
<br/>
An overview of current and expected iPhone chips:<ul><li>A17 Pro chip: 3nm (TSMC's first-generation 3nm process N3B)</li><br/>
<li>A18 chips: 3nm (TSMC's second-generation 3nm process N3E)</li><br/>
<li>A19 chips: 3nm (TSMC's third-generation 3nm process N3P)</li><br/>
<li>A20 chips: 2nm (TSMC's first-generation 2nm process N2)</li></ul>Keep in mind that these nanometer sizes like 3nm and 2nm are simply TSMC marketing terms, rather than actual measurements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/a20-chip-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995953" /><br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/kuo-a20-chip-2nm/">also expects the A20 chip to be 2nm</a>, which is not very surprising if you look at the iPhone chip trajectory.<br/>
<br/>
There is another alleged change that would be more notable. In addition to the 2nm process, Pu said that he expects the A20 chip to use TSMC's newer Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) chip packaging technology. With this new design, RAM would be integrated directly onto the chip's wafer with the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, rather than being adjacent to the chip and connected with a silicon interposer.<br/>
<br/>
This packaging change could contribute to a wide range of benefits for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Fold over previous models, including faster performance for both overall tasks and Apple Intelligence, longer battery life, and improved thermal management. The change could also result in the A20 chip having a smaller footprint than previous chips, which could free up space inside the iPhones for other uses.<br/>
<br/>
This packaging change for the A20 chip has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/iphone-18-enhanced-2nm-chip-12gb-ram/">also been rumored previously</a>.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, the A20 chip is shaping up to be a big upgrade for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Fold models, which should launch in September 2026.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-18-pro-a20-chip-with-new-design/">iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Fold Said to Use A20 Chip With New Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-and-iphone-18-fold-said-to-use-a20-chip-with-new-design.2458146/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has announced that its <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/retail/denhaag">Den Haag retail store</a> in the Netherlands will be reopening on Thursday, August 14, following a temporary closure.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Apple-Store-Den-Haag.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003475" /><br/>
As we previously reported, the store has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/apple-den-haag-temporarily-closing/">closed since June 1</a> for renovations, but Apple had not announced a reopening date until now.<br/>
<br/>
First opened in 2014, Apple Den Haag is located in The Hague, in the province of South Holland. The location is one of Apple's flagship stores, with beautiful historical architecture. It is located in a covered walkway, known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_(architecture)">arcade</a>. The remodeled store may feature an Apple Pickup station for online orders, but the exact changes planned are unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has two other stores in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam and Haarlem.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[All Apple Watch models include a stock Calculator app that offers a couple of handy features for working out how much you should tip when eating out and how much each person in a group owes if you're splitting the bill.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/split-bill-tip-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004068" /><br/>
The two functions can be used together, but if it's just yourself dining out then you can just leave the People field set to 1. The steps below show you how it works.  <br/>
<br/>
Note: If you see a standard percentage (%) button where the TIP button should be, you can change the calculator layout to replace it. Simply go to <strong>Settings ➝ Calculator</strong> and select <strong>Tip Function</strong> instead of <strong>Percent</strong>. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Use the Split Bill and Tip Calculator Functions on Apple Watch</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Calculator</strong> app on your Apple Watch.</li><br/>
<li>Enter the total amount of the bill.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>TIP</strong> button in the top-right corner, just left of the divide button. </li><br/>
<li>With the Tip field highlighted in green, turn your watch's <strong>Digital Crown</strong> to change the percentage.</li><br/>
<li>To split the bill between a group of people, tap <strong>People</strong> and then use the <strong>Digital Crown</strong> to change the number (the maximum is 50).</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/12/apple-watch-calculator-tip-function.jpg" alt="calculator" width="1920" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-883731" /><br/>
<br/>
You'll see the total amount below the two fields change to reflect your tip adjustments, and the amount below that will change depending on how many people are paying. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/split-bill-tip-on-apple-watch/">How to Split a Bill and Tip on Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-split-a-bill-and-tip-on-apple-watch.2458139/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 16e Sales Lag Behind SE Models Despite Bestseller Status</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> is one of Europe's top-selling smartphones, yet its early sales figures still lagged significantly behind those of Apple's previous mid-tier models, according to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/iphone-16e-enters-europes-top-10-in-first-month/">Counterpoint Research</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-990894" /><br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; launched in February, marking the company's first attempt in recent years to redefine its mid-range offerings with a product distinct from its "SE" branding. Despite debuting on Europe's Top 10 smartphones list in its first full month of availability, the model failed to match the initial traction of its predecessors. <br/>
<br/>
Counterpoint Research finds that the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; was the ninth best-selling smartphone in Europe in March, representing 8% of Apple's total <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales in the region and 2% of the broader smartphone market. In Western Europe, the device performed slightly better, securing the seventh position overall.<br/>
<br/>
However, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;'s early performance marks a clear departure from the success of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE models that preceded it. The third-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE from 2022 ranked sixth on the same European bestseller list during its first month and accounted for 12% of Apple's regional &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE from 2020 performed even more strongly, achieving third place overall and making up 19% of Apple's European &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales in its debut month. Compared to these benchmarks, &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; sales were down 17% versus the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2022) and down 20% compared to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2020), according to Counterpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, the primary reason identified for the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;'s weaker debut is its higher launch price. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; generally starts at €699 in Europe. This is a significant increase over the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2022), which debuted at €519, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2020), which launched at €479. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the mid-tier smartphone market in Europe is increasingly price-sensitive; consumers are showing increased interest in refurbished and second-hand iPhones, which further complicates Apple's efforts to drive volume through new mid-range hardware. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/">Counterpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-16e-sales-lag-behind-se-models/">iPhone 16e Sales Lag Behind SE Models Despite Bestseller Status</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-sales-lag-behind-se-models-despite-bestseller-status.2458137/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> is fast approaching, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/">Apple's opening keynote</a> set to begin on Monday, June 9 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time. Apple always uses the annual developer conference to unveil the latest versions of its software platforms, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26</a> all expected to be announced next week. But a key question remains: will there be any hardware announcements too?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/WWDC-2025-Apple-Logo.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004059" /><br/>
The answer to that question is likely no. In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter last weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/01/wwdc-2025-likely-smaller-scale/">Apple has no major new devices ready to ship</a>, so there might not be any hardware announcements at WWDC 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could still surprise us on the hardware front, of course, and Gurman did not explicitly rule out smaller device announcements.<br/>
<br/>
WWDC is always focused on software, but there are hardware announcements at the conference in some years. Most recently, Apple unveiled the Vision Pro and updated three Mac models at WWDC 2023. In 2024, however, it was a software-only affair.<br/>
<br/>
The only rumored Apple product that might be imminent is an AirTag 2. Gurman previously said that he expected a new AirTag <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/">to be released around mid-2025</a>, but he has not mentioned the accessory in a while, so it is unclear if that timeframe remains accurate. Even if an AirTag 2 is coming soon, there is no guarantee that it will be unveiled during the WWDC 2025 keynote, as Apple could opt to announce it with a press release only.<br/>
<br/>
The majority of Macs have been updated since October 2024, with the only exception being the high-end Mac Pro desktop tower. The current Mac Pro is equipped with Apple's M2 Ultra chip, so in theory it could be updated with the M3 Ultra chip that debuted in the Mac Studio this year, but that has not been rumored. It is also looking <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/m4-ultra-chip-is-unlikely/">unlikely that Apple will ever release an M4 Ultra chip</a>, so the Mac Pro's path forward is currently unclear.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the entire iPad lineup has been updated since May 2024, so new iPad models are unlikely to be announced at WWDC 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPhone and Apple Watch models are expected to launch in September, as usual, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/">new Apple TV and HomePod mini models are rumored to launch in September or later this year</a>. AirPods Pro 3 are also rumored to launch later this year, at the earliest, while new AirPods Max are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/when-to-expect-airpods-max-2/">not expected to launch until 2027</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There have been on-again, off-again rumors about a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/vision-pro-2-with-m5-may-not-launch-until-2026/">Vision Pro 2 with an M5 chip</a>, but it is unclear if that would launch in 2025 or 2026.<br/>
<br/>
A new version of Apple's standalone Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting has been rumored, but it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">not expected to launch until late 2025 or early 2026</a>. Apple's higher-end Pro Display XDR has not been updated since it first launched in 2019, but it is unclear if and when a new version of the display will be released.<br/>
<br/>
Last, Apple's rumored smart home hub <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-smart-home-hub-postponed/">has been postponed</a> due to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delayed Siri features</a>, so do not expect that device to launch at WWDC 2025. However, it is plausible that Apple could provide an early preview of the device at the conference. Gurman said that the device will not have an App Store, but there could be new APIs for developers.<br/>
<br/>
That wraps up where things stand. As mentioned, though, a surprise or two is always possible. <br/>
<br/>
The keynote will be streamed on Apple's website, in the Apple TV app, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/">on YouTube</a>. On-demand playback will be available afterwards.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/wwdc-2025-new-hardware-or-not/">Will Apple Announce Any New Hardware at WWDC 2025 Next Week?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-apple-announce-any-new-hardware-at-wwdc-2025-next-week.2458135/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple TV+ is emerging as the frontrunner to acquire additional MLB media rights currently held by ESPN, according to a <em><a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/06/02/apple-tv-emerging-as-leading-candidate-among-streamers-to-land-more-mlb-rights/">Sports Business Journal</a></em> report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-TV-Plus-Friday-Night-Baseball-2025.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992463" /><br/>
Sources tell the publication that Apple's offer would likely exceed what NBC has proposed for the same package, particularly if focused on Sunday night games. NBC reportedly bid for all of ESPN's current MLB rights, but the league faces a familiar streaming dilemma: fewer dollars from traditional broadcasters with broader reach versus higher payments from digital platforms with smaller audiences.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already pays MLB a reported &#36;85 million annually for "Friday Night Baseball" through to 2028. The potential deal would be structured as a three-year agreement, positioning MLB to bundle all national rights when current contracts with Fox Sports and TNT Sports expire in 2028.<br/>
<br/>
The streaming service currently includes Friday night games at no additional cost with Apple TV+ subscriptions, which cost &#36;9.99 monthly or &#36;99 yearly in the U.S. It's also included in all Apple One subscription bundles with other Apple services.<br/>
<br/>
MLB has yet to finalize the structure of post-ESPN packages, leaving multiple scenarios on the table for Sunday night games, Wild Card coverage, and the Home Run Derby. The talks sound like they remain fluid, with various moving parts still under consideration.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/apple-tv-bidding-more-mlb-games/">Apple TV+ Reportedly Outbidding NBC for More MLB Games</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-reportedly-outbidding-nbc-for-more-mlb-games.2458125/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp has ended support for iOS versions older than iOS 15.1, removing the chat platform's compatibility with several iPhone models in the process. The change began on June 1, after Meta delayed it from an original planned date of May 5.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
WhatsApp is no longer compatible with iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus models. Users with those devices won't be able to access the encrypted chat service through the app unless they upgrade their iPhone. Alternatively, users can visit web.whatsapp.com in their browser, but the experience won't be the same.<br/>
<br/>
Users who intend to upgrade can back up their WhatsApp chats to iCloud, and restore their full chat and media history to a newer, supported device using using WhatsApp's Chat Transfer feature. Instructions on how to do so are outlined in WhatsApp's <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/209942271778103/?cms_platform=iphone&helpref=platform_switcher">Help Center</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In related developments, WhatsApp is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/whatsapp-for-ipad-now-available/">now available on the iPad</a>, coming more than 15 years after the messaging service launched. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/instagram-ipad-app/">Instagram app for the iPad</a> is also in the works.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/whatsapp-drops-support-iphone-models/">WhatsApp Drops Support for These iPhone Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-drops-support-for-these-iphone-models.2458120/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube has updated its iOS app to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/youtube/id544007664?platform=iphone">version 20.22.1</a>, which now requires iOS 16 or later to install and run. The change means several older iPhone models are no longer officially compatible with the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/General-YouTube-Feature-Redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-983782" /><br/>
The affected devices are those that cannot upgrade beyond iOS 15 – namely, the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and the first-generation iPhone SE. If you have an iPod touch 7, that will no longer run the app either.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the YouTube app for iPad now requires iPadOS 16 or later, which means the app has discontinued support for the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4. <br/>
<br/>
Users with these older devices can still access YouTube through their web browser by visiting m.youtube.com, but the experience won't match the native app's functionality.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/">YouTube</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/youtube-ios-app-dropped-support-iphones/">YouTube&#039;s iOS App Just Dropped Support for These iPhone Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtubes-ios-app-just-dropped-support-for-these-iphone-models.2458119/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<category>ProMotion</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[A Chinese leaker with a mixed track record for accurate predictions has today disputed claims that the regular iPhone 17 and all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will feature ProMotion displays.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Air-Pastel-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999629" /><br/>
ProMotion has been limited to the Pro models since it debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021, but several sources have suggested that Apple will this year fit the 120Hz variable refresh technology into the base iPhone 17 model, as well as the new iPhone 17 Air that replaces the Plus model in the lineup.<br/>
<br/>
However, Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PuPiSAB0t">Fixed Focus Digital</a>'s sources apparently tell them that the panel being used in the upcoming non-Pro models is "just a standard 120Hz screen, not ProMotion with adaptive refresh rate." If the claim is true, it would indicate that Apple is still using low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) panels for its lower-end iPhone models, albeit fixed at 120Hz, whereas the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are fitted with 60Hz LTPS panels.<br/>
<br/>
Without ProMotion, a fixed 120Hz panel will still feel smooth, particularly during scrolling, animations, and UI transitions. However, it would likely drain more battery, since it's refreshing rapidly all the time, even when viewing static content. In contrast, ProMotion dynamically adjusts the refresh rate anywhere between 1Hz and 120Hz, depending on content and user interaction, which preserves battery life. <br/>
<br/>
A fixed 120Hz panel also means the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air would lack Apple's always-on display capability that shows the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked and idle.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, the case for ProMotion coming to the non-Pro iPhone 17 remains strong. Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor/">indicated</a> that Apple's suppliers are ramping up production of LTPO panels for the entire iPhone 17 lineup, further supporting the possibility of ProMotion displays across all models. LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) is a low-power backplane technology for OLED displays that allows for a variable refresh rate with reduced power consumption. Young's claim has since been corroborated by South Korea's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/iphone-17-always-on-promotion-displays/"><em>ETNews</em></a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/ltpo-for-all-iphone-17-models-report/"><em>The Elec</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
Fixed Focus Digital has shared accurate predictions in the past, including correctly naming the iPhone 16E before its official confirmation. The account also accurately claimed the iPhone 16 Pro models would be available in a new bronze finish, which ended up being Desert Titanium. On the other hand, the account was wrong about the number of iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus color options that would be available. As for ProMotion, the weight of evidence is against them on this rumor, and we're personally hoping it's a bad call. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup around September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/promotion/">ProMotion</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-17-promotion-rumors-disputed/">iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air ProMotion Rumors Disputed by Leaker</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-and-iphone-17-air-promotion-rumors-disputed-by-leaker.2458116/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>WWDC 2025: What to Expect From macOS 26 Tahoe</title>

		<description><![CDATA[WWDC is less than a week away, and as we ramp up to the big announcement, we're going to share details on what we know about each operating system. We're starting with the next-generation version of macOS, which Apple is apparently going <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/01/macos-tahoe-name-leaked/">to call macOS Tahoe</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/macOS-Tahoe-Render.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003768" /><br/>
<h2>Name</h2><br/>
Since the current version of macOS is macOS 15, it would normally be followed by macOS 16, but Apple is changing its naming scheme for operating system updates starting this year.<br/>
<br/>
Everything coming out in 2025 will be numbered with a "26" to reflect its release season, covering the period between September 2025 and September 2026. We're getting macOS 26, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>, iPadOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26. Apple could have gone with 25 because that's the year of launch, but 26 technically does make more sense because there are more months in 2026 where we'll have the 26 series of updates installed.<br/>
<br/>
With the streamlined naming that Apple is implementing, there won't be a need to remember separate, confusing numbers for each operating system. It might be confusing at first for people to go from macOS 15 to macOS 26, but it should make more sense over the long haul.<br/>
<br/>
macOS is special because it always gets a California landmark name along with its number, unlike other operating systems. This year, it looks like Apple is going to go with "Tahoe," a popular lake between California and Nevada. Lake Tahoe is a popular vacation destination all year long, but particularly in the winter where it is known for its ski slopes.<br/>
<br/>
Tahoe will join the other California landmark names that Apple has used, including Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma, and Sequoia.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design Overhaul</h2><br/>
Most of the rumors that we've heard about Apple's upcoming software have focused on &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and the design changes that Apple has planned, but macOS 26 is going to get some of those same design updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/macOS-26-visionOS-Inspired-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003299" /><br/>
The revamp might not be quite as dramatic, but Apple wants to have a more cohesive look and feel across its operating systems, hence the design overhaul and the "26" name change.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/visionos-files-app-translucency.jpg" alt="" width="1178" height="666" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003681" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The visionOS interface</em></div><br/>
Basically, Apple is expanding some visionOS design elements to all of its software, with a focus on translucency, rounded menus and buttons, and a frosted glass-like look for the interface. On the Mac, Apple already uses translucency for some things like the menu bar and the dock, but we could perhaps see more translucency in windows and menu elements.<br/>
<br/>
App icons that have a more rounded look could happen, and we could see rounder corners for windows and other interface elements. Apple could also adopt some floating menu bars, and add more depth to everything for a glossier look and feel.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/visionos-glass.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003682" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The visionOS interface</em></div><br/>
Streamlined navigation, menus, and layout could bring better design consistency across iOS and macOS. Expect to see design changes at the operating system level and in Apple's apps, with Apple also providing new guidelines and assets for developers to tailor their apps to match the updated aesthetic.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
There are new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features coming in macOS 26, but Apple is undoubtedly going to be more reserved about announcing anything that's not ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/shortcuts-app-apple-intelligence-integration/">update the Shortcuts app</a> to integrate &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;. Users will be able to create actions that use &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; models, which should make it easier for casual users to create useful shortcuts.<br/>
<br/>
Apple might give us some insight into when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> will be able to integrate with Gemini in addition to ChatGPT, because that's a feature coming soon.<br/>
<br/>
All those personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that Apple announced at WWDC 2024 are going to come in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and macOS 26 at some point, but it's not clear if they'll be ready by WWDC. If they're not ready to go, Apple probably won't mention them, and we'll get them later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
As a reminder, we're waiting on personal context that lets &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; keep track of emails, messages, files, photos, and more, or basically anything on your device. Apple is also adding onscreen awareness so &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can help you with what's on your screen, and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will also get deeper app integration so that it can do more in and across apps.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Gaming App</h2><br/>
There's a new game app in the works that'll be available for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS. It'll have the games you'd normally find in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> titles, along with sections for in-game achievements, leaderboards, and editorial content.<br/>
<br/>
You'll be able to use the app to communicate with other people, and on the Mac, it'll be able to tap into games downloaded outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/">Mac App Store</a>. It'll replace Game Center, and will be a more feature rich app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Other Rumored Features</h2><br/>
Apple previewed several Accessibility features that are coming in macOS 26 and &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, plus there have been rumors of new Wi-Fi features.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Captive Wi-Fi Portal Syncing</strong> - When you log into a captive Wi-Fi network, like at a hotel or an airport, you'll only need to do it once and the info will sync across all of your devices.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Magnifier</strong> - Apple will let you connect an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to your Mac to use the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s camera for zooming in on text and other things that you might need help seeing.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Vehicle Motion Cues</strong> - The little dots that are meant to help you from getting carsick or airsick are also coming to the Mac. Vehicle Motion Cues is meant to match the feeling of movement with what the eyes are seeing.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>Compatibility</h2><br/>
macOS Tahoe could drop support for some older Macs, including the 2018 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, the 2019 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, the 2017 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro, the 2018 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, and the 2020 Intel-based <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. The update is expected to be compatible with the following Macs:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; (2019 and later)</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iMac&zwnj; (2020 and later)</li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> (2019 and later)</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the 11-inch and 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models to its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad/ipad-air">refurbished store in the United States</a>, offering these tablets at a discounted price in the U.S. for the first time since its May 2024 launch.<br/>
<br/>

Refurbished &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models are discounted by approximately 15 percent compared to Apple's original pricing for new models. The 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with 128GB of storage is &#36;469, for example, while the base 13-inch 128GB &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is &#36;639. Apple originally sold the 11-inch &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; for &#36;549, and the 13-inch model for &#36;749.<br/>
<br/>
The refurbished &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models were added to the UK store <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/refurbished-ipad-air-m2-chip/">earlier this month</a>, but they are new to the U.S. store.<br/>
<br/>
Apple replaced the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with the M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; earlier this year, so the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; models are the prior-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; option and can no longer be purchased new from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
There are multiple colors and capacities available as of the time of writing, as well as cellular and standard Wi-Fi models, but stock will fluctuate over time as Apple refreshes what's available. If you're aiming for a particular color or capacity, you might need to check back.<br/>
<br/>
Refurbished iPads from Apple are equipped with new batteries, outer shells, and a new USB-C cable, and are essentially identical in performance to new-in-box iPads. Apple offers a one-year warranty on refurbished iPads, and buyers can purchase extended <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ coverage.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/m2-ipad-air-refurbished/">Discounted M2 iPad Air Models Now Available in Apple&#039;s U.S. Refurbished Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/discounted-m2-ipad-air-models-now-available-in-apples-u-s-refurbished-store.2458096/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been three weeks as of today since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-ios-18-5/">released iOS 18.5</a>, and we are still waiting for the first iOS 18.6 beta to follow.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18.6-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997222" /><br/>
Below, we outline everything we know about iOS 18.6 so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Timing</h2><br/>
Apple's software engineers have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-begins-testing-ios-18-6/">internally testing iOS 18.6 since late March</a>, according to the <em>MacRumors</em> visitors logs.<br/>
<br/>
The first betas of iOS 13.6 through iOS 16.6 were all released before WWDC over the years, while the first iOS 17.6 beta was released the week after WWDC last year, so it is hard to pinpoint exactly when the first iOS 18.6 beta will be available.<br/>

 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
iOS 18.6 will likely be released by mid-July.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">expected to announce iOS 26</a> at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-sleek-peek/">WWDC 2025 next week</a>, instead of iOS 19, as part of a new software version number scheme. The first beta of iOS 26 should be seeded to developers shortly after Apple's keynote on Monday, June 9, and the update will likely be released to the general public in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Features</h2><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects iOS 18.6 to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-6-ios-19/">enable Apple Intelligence in China</a>, with Alibaba and Baidu set to power some of the features in that country.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.6 is also likely to include bug fixes and patch security vulnerabilities.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if the update will have any other changes. With the iOS 26 beta just around the corner, iOS 18.6 is likely to be a minor update.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/what-to-expect-from-ios-18-6/">What to Expect From iOS 18.6 as One of the Final Updates Before iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-ios-18-6-as-one-of-the-final-updates-before-ios-26.2458088/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Polestar remains committed to offering <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">CarPlay Ultra</a> in its future electric vehicles, a company spokesperson told <em>MacRumors</em> today. However, the brand did not provide a specific timeframe for availability, or any other details at this time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Polestar-Apple-CarPlay-Ultra-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003934" /><br/>
Many automakers have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/carplay-ultra-automaker-comments/">tight-lipped about adopting CarPlay Ultra</a>, so Polestar confirming that it still plans to offer the software system is notable.<br/>
<br/>
CarPlay Ultra is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/first-look-at-carplay-ultra/">limited to luxury Aston Martin vehicles</a> in the U.S. and Canada. Apple said that many other automakers around the world are working to offer it over the next year and beyond, including Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/CarPlay-Ultra-Aston-Martin.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001809" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Apple-CarPlay-Ultra-instrument-cluster-themes-01-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001714" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/CarPlay-Ultra-Climate-Controls.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001805" /><br/>
Polestar was one of more than a dozen automakers that Apple had listed as being committed to offering the next generation of CarPlay, now known as CarPlay Ultra, when it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">first announced in 2022</a>. Given the list is now three years old, however, it is possible that some automakers have shifted gears. For example, Mercedes-Benz was included in the list, but it has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144356/mercedes-benz-ceo-apple-carplay-next-gen-decoder">decided not to</a> let Apple take over its in-vehicle software experience.<br/>
<br/>
That original list from 2022 was as follows:<ul><li>Acura</li><br/>
<li>Audi</li><br/>
<li>Ford</li><br/>
<li>Honda</li><br/>
<li>Infiniti</li><br/>
<li>Jaguar</li><br/>
<li>Land Rover</li><br/>
<li>Lincoln</li><br/>
<li>Mercedes-Benz</li><br/>
<li>Nissan</li><br/>
<li>Polestar</li><br/>
<li>Porsche</li><br/>
<li>Renault</li><br/>
<li>Volvo</li></ul>Aston Martin was announced later.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">Launched last month</a>, CarPlay Ultra features deep integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster and systems, built-in Radio and Climate apps, widgets, and more. The interface is tailored to each vehicle model and automaker's identity, and drivers can also adjust the color scheme.
