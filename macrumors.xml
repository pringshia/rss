		<description><![CDATA[It was a big week for retro gaming fans, as iPhone users are starting to reap the rewards of Apple's recent change to allow retro game emulators on the App Store.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/top-stories-20apr2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947573" /><br/>
This week also saw a new iOS 17.5 beta that will support web-based app distribution in the EU, the debut of the first hotels to allow for direct AirPlay streaming to room TVs, a fresh rumor about the impending iPad Air update, and more details on the sequence of Apple's M4-based Mac updates starting later this year, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Delta Game Emulator Now Available From App Store on iPhone</h2><br/>
A few weeks after Apple updated its App Review Guidelines to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">allow retro game console emulator apps</a>, the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/">Nintendo emulator Delta is now available in the App Store</a>. Delta can emulate games released for many older Nintendo consoles, including the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Nintendo DS, and all Game Boy models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Delta-Emulator-Pokemon-Gen-3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947545" /><br/>
We published an article explaining <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/what-to-know-about-iphone-app-store-emulators/">key facts about emulators in the App Store</a> and the legality of downloading games.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New iOS 17.5 Beta Lets EU iPhone Users Download Apps Directly From Websites</h2><br/>
Starting with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/apple-seeds-ios-17-5-beta-2-to-developers/">second beta of iOS 17.5</a>, released this week, large developers in the EU <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/ios-17-5-app-web-downloads-eu/">can now distribute apps directly on the web</a> instead of through the App Store or an alternative app marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes-Orange-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946723" /><br/>
To be eligible for this new Web Distribution feature, Apple says a developer must meet several requirements, including having an app that had more than one million annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17's New AirPlay Feature for Hotel Room TVs Begins Rolling Out</h2><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/ios-17-airplay-hotel-feature-now-available/">announced that AirPlay is now available at around 60 hotels</a> operated by IHG Hotels & Resorts in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/IHG-Hotel-AirPlay.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947151" /><br/>
At hotels that offer the feature, guests can scan a unique QR code on their room's TV to establish an AirPlay connection, allowing them to wirelessly stream content from their iPhone or iPad. For example, they could stream Apple TV+ or Netflix shows, listen to music on Apple Music or Spotify, play games on Apple Arcade, or work out with Apple Fitness+.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 30 Rumored Upgrades Compared</h2><br/>
While the iPhone 16 lineup is still months away from being announced, there are already many rumors about the four devices that have been circulating for months.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-15-Pro-vs-16-Pro-Feature-Cyan-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935694" /><br/>
If you own an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max model, and will be considering upgrading to the iPhone 16 Pro family, check out our new comparison chart that outlines <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">over 30 rumored new features and changes for the iPhone 16 Pro models</a>, and if you're an iPhone 15 or 15 Plus user, we're tracking <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16/">over 15 changes expected for the iPhone 16 models</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>12.9-Inch iPad Air Now Rumored to Feature Mini-LED Display</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/">rumored 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> that is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">expected to be announced in May</a> will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/12-9-inch-ipad-air-mini-led-display-rumor/">equipped with a mini-LED display</a> like the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro, according to info shared this week by Ross Young, CEO of research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
The existing 10.9-inch iPad Air is equipped with a standard LCD panel, and the move to mini-LED technology for the 12.9-inch model would provide increased brightness for HDR content, deeper blacks, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M4 Macs Are Expected to Launch in This Order Starting Later This Year</h2><br/>
In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter this week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman outlined the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/when-are-m4-macs-launching/">order in which he expects Macs with the M4 family of chips to be released</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-AI-Optimized-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945901" /><br/>
Gurman said the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/when-are-m4-macs-launching/">entire Mac lineup will be updated</a> with the M4 chip or higher-end variants, starting with the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini between late 2024 and early 2025, followed by the MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro between the spring and end of 2025.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Today marks the three-year anniversary of Apple's announcement of the 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, a transformative redesign featuring the first integration of Apple silicon in the product line.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iMac-24-Apple-Newsroom-Gray-bg.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-930105" /><br/>
Apple unveiled the new 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; on April 20, 2021, almost nine years after the previous &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; redesign debuted. It replaced both the 21.5-inch and the 27-inch Intel iMacs, and represented a recommitment to the long-standing desktop product line.<br/>
<br/>
The highly anticipated redesign offers a much thinner and more compact body compared to its predecessors, available in an array of vibrant colors reminiscent of the original iMacs released in the late 1990s. The 24-inch 4.5K Retina display boasts 11.3 million pixels and support for 1 billion colors.<br/>
<br/>
The new model was not only notable for its updated design but also as the inaugural &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; to incorporate Apple silicon, one of the last Macs to make the transition away from Intel. Apple claimed that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip delivered up to 85% faster CPU performance and up to two-times faster GPU performance compared to the previous 21.5-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; models. The new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; also offered a 1080p <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> HD camera, studio-quality microphones, and a six-speaker sound system, as well as a color-matched Magic Keyboard with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple refreshed the 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with the M3 chip, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 in November 2023. Rumors suggest that a larger-screened &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; that could be positioned as an &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">launch in 2025</a>. In June 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that the high-end &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; was a year or two away from launching as work on the device was still in the early stages.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/24-inch-imac-three-years-ago-today/">Apple Announced the 24-Inch iMac Three Years Ago Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announced-the-24-inch-imac-three-years-ago-today.2424556/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to refresh the MacBook Pro with M4 chips starting in late 2024, and this guide aggregates everything that we know about Apple's M4 MacBook Pro plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945903" /><br/>
<h2 id="m4_update">M4 Update</h2><br/>
Apple built the M3 chip on a new 3-nanometer process, and we are not expecting a node change for the M4. It too will be a 3-nanometer chip, but Apple supplier TSMC could introduce updates that make it more efficient and faster.<br/>
<br/>
New artificial intelligence capabilities are rumored for Apple's upcoming products, and so the M4 will focus on AI. Apple wants to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/m4-ai-chips-late-2024/">improve performance</a> for AI functionality, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">rumors suggest</a> that the M4 (and the A18 chips for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>) will have an upgraded Neural Engine with "significantly" more cores.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 chips all have a 16-core Neural Engine, and Apple has not increased the Neural Engine cores for several years.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="entry-level_14-inch_macbook_pro">Entry-Level 14-Inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
With the M3 chip launch last year, Apple did away with the 13-inch MacBook Pro. It's been replaced with the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which Apple now offers with three different chip options.<br/>
<br/>
The entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro has an M3 chip and a &#36;1,599 starting price, and this is the model that will get the standard M4 chip. The current M3 chip has an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, and the M4 could be similar.<br/>

For customers who want a more "pro" machine, the higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are set to be refreshed with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, which are more powerful versions of the faster M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
The current M3 Pro has up to a 12-core CPU and up to an 18-core GPU, while the M3 Max has up to a 16-core CPU and up to a 40-core GPU. CPU and GPU improvements for the M4 Pro and M4 Max aren't yet known.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design_changes">Design Changes?</h2><br/>
There are no rumors of a design change for the MacBook Pro at this time, and we're not quite due for one. Apple last updated the MacBook Pro design in 2021 with the transition to Apple silicon. In recent history, Apple has redesigned the MacBook in 2012, 2016, and 2021, so following that pattern, we'll see the next design tweak in 2025 or 2026.<br/>
<br/>
This year's M-series update will likely be limited to the MacBook Pro's internals.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="launch_date">Launch Date</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/when-are-m4-macs-launching/">According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro could get an M4 chip in late 2024, while the timeline for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro refresh is estimated at late 2024 to early 2025.<br/>
<br/>
We could see the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max variants come out all at once like the M3 chip lineup, or Apple could space them out across several months.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 MacBook Pro models came out in October 2023, so a refresh around October 2024 would come at the one-year mark.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">Apple&#039;s M4 MacBook Pro Lineup: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-m4-macbook-pro-lineup-what-to-expect.2424533/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began selling certified refurbished Apple Watch Ultra 2 models in the U.S. for the first time since the device was released in September.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-hero-feature-blorange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911679" /><br/>
As of writing, refurbished Ultra 2 models with the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FREG3LW/A/Refurbished-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-GPS-Cellular-49mm-Titanium-Case-with-Blue-Ocean-Band">Blue</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FREH3LW/A/Refurbished-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-GPS-Cellular-49mm-Titanium-Case-with-Orange-Ocean-Band?fnode=c33d6587feda6a2d1b4df893338e0b10c6def7ee3d2db1465e981af4a26e20b29a9c5339994ab02294593ec3968732539fefa1c777bc2e2d0e1bd6aff98bcb1fe958a412ce82bc5f5b2e7389568d2e15">Orange</a>, or <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FREJ3LW/A/Refurbished-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-GPS-Cellular-49mm-Titanium-Case-with-White-Ocean-Band?fnode=e5406cc44be0df3204093d631dbb4976cebe18e711d09d02bbce5167a990eea5a25cbe8bf141f71311fff9fcc8eb7773853603822f89ae164ace9014c53293a3a11637451df5bf9098715a484e206991">White Ocean Band</a> are available for &#36;679, compared to &#36;799 brand new.<br/>
<br/>
Like new Ultra 2 models sold directly by Apple in the U.S. currently, we expect that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/apple-website-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-removal/">Blood Oxygen app is deactivated</a> on the refurbished models, due to a legal battle with medical technology company Masimo. Last year, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/itc-opposes-apple-watch-sales-ban-pause/">banned Apple</a> from importing and selling Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing after it ruled that the feature infringed on Masimo's patents. Apple is appealing the decision, and could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensor-software/">re-enable the Blood Oxygen app with a watchOS update</a> if it is overturned.<br/>
<br/>
Availability began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/refurbished-apple-watch-ultra-2-begins-rolling-out/">in the U.K. and China</a> earlier this week, and the Blood Oxygen app remains functional outside of the U.S. currently.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on late Thursday into Friday removed the popular messaging and social media apps WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and Threads from its App Store in China at the request of the Chinese government, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-removes-whatsapp-threads-from-china-app-store-on-government-orders-a0c02100"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported</a>.<br/>

In a statement shared with several media outlets, Apple said China's national internet regulator ordered the removal of the apps from the App Store in the country due to unspecified "national security concerns." Apple said it is "obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has complied with similar App Store removal orders from the Chinese government in the past for apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/20/senators-ask-apple-why-vpn-apps-removed-china/">related to VPNs</a>, news, and more.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/apple-pulls-whatsapp-telegram-signal-threads-china/">Apple Pulls WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and Threads From App Store in China Following Order</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pulls-whatsapp-telegram-signal-and-threads-from-app-store-in-china-following-order.2424517/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>European Regulators Will Soon Approve Apple&#039;s Plan to Open Up Tap-to-Pay to Banks and Payment Providers</title>

		<description><![CDATA[As part of the changes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/">introduced in Europe in iOS 17.4</a>, Apple gave third-party payment apps and banks direct access to the NFC chip, allowing for non-Apple Pay tap-to-pay payment options. The European Commission is set to approve Apple's plan to open up tap-and-go mobile payments "as soon as next month," according to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apples-offer-open-up-tap-and-go-tech-be-approved-by-eu-next-month-sources-say-2024-04-19/">Reuters</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-921515" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-pay-feature-dynamic-island.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
With NFC access, banks and third-party payment apps can offer contactless payments directly on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> without having to use the Wallet app or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>. This feature is available in the European Economic Area, and it lets EU users set a default non-Apple wallet app and default contactless payment provider that activates at tap-to-pay terminals or when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s side button is pressed twice.<br/>
<br/>
The European Economic Area (EEA) is the only area where Apple has opened up NFC access, and developers in other countries cannot access the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s NFC chip for tap-to-pay purposes. Customers will be able to use NFC-enabled apps from their banks and other payment providers with no involvement from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has long limited the NFC chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and other Apple devices to &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; payments, which has prevented banks and other financial services from providing their customers with direct contactless payment solutions on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first announced plans to open NFC payment technology to third-party developers in Europe <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/apple-offers-to-open-nfc-in-europe/">in January</a>, and Apple made the change in order to address antitrust charges it was facing from the European Commission (EC). The EC has accused Apple of limiting competition by preventing rival mobile wallets from accessing the NFC chip, and Apple's decision to open it up will prevent fines and other penalties.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/">NFC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/eu-regulators-tap-to-pay-approval/">European Regulators Will Soon Approve Apple&#039;s Plan to Open Up Tap-to-Pay to Banks and Payment Providers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/european-regulators-will-soon-approve-apples-plan-to-open-up-tap-to-pay-to-banks-and-payment-providers.2424513/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

We talk through the response to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/humane-ai-pin/">Humane's AI Pin</a> and its widely acknowledged deficiencies, such as its limited utility, subpar camera performance, and steep price point. We also take a look at the Rabbit R1, another AI device that prompts us to question the necessity of such hardware when similar functionalities could potentially be achieved with existing smartphones. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to introduce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/m4-ai-chips-late-2024/">M4-series custom silicon chips</a> starting this year, featuring more powerful Neural Engines with more cores to support AI processes. These chips are likely based on the advancements coming to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup's A18 chip, hinting that iPhone-exclusive AI features could later come to the Mac. <br/>
<br/>
We also touch on the progress of AI tools in video editing software, including recent announcements from Adobe Premiere and DaVinci Resolve which have introduced new AI-driven editing features like generative fill and object removal. Such features could see enhanced performance on next-generation Macs with AI-focused chips. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> is now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips going forward:<br/>

To celebrate Earth Day, GRID Studio is hosting a special deal on one of its most popular products, <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/framed-iphone-4">offering the GRID 4</a> for just &#36;99. The GRID 4 features a disassembled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 4, with all of the components skillfully arranged to give a look back at Apple's history.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4 is one of Apple's most notable designs, because it introduced the first major design update after the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 3G, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 3GS. It featured an all-new look with squared edges that felt decidedly modern at the time, and it is an aesthetic that Apple returned to starting with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12.<br/>
<br/>

GRID's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4 piece includes the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4 internals, ranging from the logic board with Apple A4 chip and PowerVR GPU to the iconic Home button. Components are labeled and arranged in a logical way so you can tell what's what. GRID's art makes a great gift for any Apple enthusiast, and there are many other <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/collections/iphone">disassembled iPhone options</a> ranging from the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X.<br/>
<br/>

In addition to the sale on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4, GRID is discounting all of its products by 15 percent. GRID customers who spend over &#36;30 this week can get a special <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-earth-day-eco-tee">Earth Day Eco Tee</a> for just &#36;9.99, with the shirt featuring a recycling logo made up of a ton of tiny Apple devices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The lead developer of the multi-emulator app <a href="https://provenance-emu.com/">Provenance</a> has <a href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/exclusive-iphone-emulator-provenance-following-delta-onto-the-app-store-with-sega-and-playstation-support-in-tow">told <em>iMore</em></a> that his team is working towards releasing the app on the App Store, but he did not provide a timeframe. Provenance is a frontend for many existing emulators, and it would allow iPhone and Apple TV users to emulate games released for a <a href="https://wiki.provenance-emu.com/info/supported-systems">wide variety of classic game consoles</a>, including the original PlayStation, GameCube, Wii, SEGA Genesis, Atari 2600, and others.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Provenance-Emulator.jpeg" alt="" width="2000" height="1081" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947409" /><br/>
Apple has so far approved emulators on the App Store for older Nintendo consoles <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emu64-xl/id6483251916">and the Commodore 64</a>. For example, Riley Testut's popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/">Delta emulator is now in the App Store</a> in many countries, and it can emulate games released for the Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Nintendo 64, and Nintendo DS. Provenance would bring the first Sony, SEGA, and Atari emulators to the App Store if approved.<br/>
<br/>
Provenance has been in development since 2016, and it can already be sideloaded on the iPhone and the Apple TV outside of the App Store.<br/>
<br/>
Apple updated its App Review Guidelines earlier this month to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">allow "retro game console emulator apps"</a> on the App Store for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other devices. Earlier this week, Apple told us that emulators that can load games (ROMs) are permitted on the App Store, so long as the apps are emulating "retro console games" only. It is unclear if Apple will consider consoles like the GameCube and Wii to be "retro."<br/>
<br/>
While a U.S. court <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment,_Inc._v._Connectix_Corp.">ruled</a> that emulators are legal, downloading copyrighted ROMs is typically against the law in the country. On its <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55888/~/intellectual-property-%26-piracy-faq">customer support website</a> for the U.S., Nintendo says that downloading pirated copies of its games is illegal. A wide collection of public-domain <a href="https://hh.gbdev.io/">"homebrew" games</a> are available to play legally.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emulator/">Emulator</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/ps1-gamecube-wii-emulator-coming-to-app-store/">PlayStation, GameCube, Wii, and SEGA Emulator for iPhone and Apple TV Coming to App Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/playstation-gamecube-wii-and-sega-emulator-for-iphone-and-apple-tv-coming-to-app-store.2424504/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/PyGjJX">BLUETTI</a>, a company known for its portable power stations and associated accessories, is <a href="https://bluetti-swapsolar-an-ecosystem.kckb.st/66dc4294">currently running an Indiegogo campaign</a> for its new SwapSolar ecosystem of app-enabled products. The launch products in the SwapSolar family include a high-capacity power station with removable hot-swappable batteries plus a multifunction portable cooler. Together, they can keep your perishables cool for up to six days while completely off the grid, or essentially indefinitely with occasional access to power.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-swapsolar-fridge-power-station.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947210" /><br/>
The crowdfunding campaign for the SwapSolar campaign is drawing to a close in just a few days with over &#36;1.1 million pledged by backers, and I've been testing out both main products in the lineup to see how they work, including their app integration that lets you keep tabs on the accessories and make adjustments right from your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>3-in-1 Portable MultiCooler</h2><br/>
The highlight of the lineup is the unique 3-in-1 Portable MultiCooler, which can serve as a fridge, a freezer, and an ice maker. BLUETTI says it's the first portable fridge powered by high-density LFP batteries, which retain 80% of their original capacity even after 3,000 cycles. A single BLUETTI B70 battery can power the fridge for up to three days, but it can also run off a standard electrical outlet, a 12-volt socket such as those found in vehicles, or solar panels.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-multicooler.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947211" /><br/>
The fridge compartment has a 40-liter/42-quart capacity with an additional 9-liter/9.5-quart ice maker compartment that can produce ice in just 15 minutes from an onboard water tank. The fridge itself features a rapid cool-down mode that can chill the compartment from 85º F (30ºC) to freezing in 15 minutes, and you can set the temperature to as low as –4º F (–20 ºC), so it will work as either a fridge or a freezer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-multicooler-open.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1170" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947212" /><br/>
In my testing, the unit was capable of holding temperature quite well both slightly above and below freezing. BLUETTI recommends keeping the fridge fairly full of items and minimizing the amount of time the lid is left open to help minimize temperature fluctuations, but even with only a few items in the fridge I only ever saw the temperature briefly rise by a degree or two following a quick opening of the lid.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-multicooler-display.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947218" /><br/>
The ice maker is a neat functionality of the MultiCooler, allowing for on-demand generation of ice cubes in two size options for drinks or other needs. Simply fill the ice maker compartment with between 400 ml and 1 L of water, and start up the ice-making cycle. The unit does the rest automatically, passing water over a chilled metal grid to freeze it in sets of 24 cubes.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't call even the larger-sized cubes substantial by any means, but they can be made quickly and do the trick for keeping a drink cold. An initial cycle took about 25 minutes to produce a set of cubes, and two additional sets from the same batch of water took about 10 minutes each. You can set the ice maker to produce one set of cubes at a time, or it can run continuously for as long as its water supply holds up or until the ice basket fills up, spitting each batch of cubes into the basket as the cycle completes and immediately starting a new one.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-multicooler-ice.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947213" /><br/>
It is worth noting that running an ice-making cycle diverts the unit's power to that function, resulting in the fridge portion gradually warming up. I had the fridge compartment set at 35 ºF, and over the course of the approximately 50 minutes as I ran multiple ice-making cycles, the fridge temperature gradually rose to 44 ºF. It only took about 10 minutes to return to 35 ºF once I stopped making ice, and I didn't notice nearly that much effect on every test series, but it's definitely something to be aware of if you've got perishables in the fridge.<br/>
<br/>
BLUETTI recommends that you change out the water reservoir for the ice maker every 24 hours and fully clean the compartment every three days for hygienic reasons. The unit can run its own 20-minute self-cleaning cycle on the ice-making components, provided it has enough water and power to do so.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-multicooler-side.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1150" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947215" /><br/>
In addition to its primary function as a fridge, the MultiCooler can also charge other devices, provided you have a battery installed in the unit. A 100-watt USB-C port and a 15-watt USB-A port are located on the side of the unit, making it easy to plug in a laptop, phone, or other device for recharging.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-multicooler-battery.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947219" /><br/>
The most notable physical aspect of the MultiCooler to me is its sheer size and weight. It's rather large at 28 inches (71 cm) by 16.5 inches (42 cm) by 18.7 inches (47.5 cm), so it'll definitely be easier if you've got an SUV, pickup, or van to haul it to wherever you're going. Large coolers are certainly common equipment for camping and picnicking, but it's worth noting that this MultiCooler will hold considerably less than a similarly sized basic cooler, considering the space taken up by the active cooling components and the ice maker.<br/>
<br/>
But even more than the size, it's the weight that limits the MultiCooler's portability, as it tips the scales at almost 53 pounds (24 kg) on its own. A battery weighs an additional 18.7 pounds (8.5 kg), so for on-the-go functionality you're looking at over 70 pounds (32 kg) before you've even put any food or ice-making water into it.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, the MultiCooler has convenient recessed handles built into the sides of the unit, but lifting it in and out of a vehicle can still be quite difficult for some people trying to do it by themselves. The removable battery and food baskets can help break the load up into a few pieces to get it out of your vehicle, but the main unit remains quite heavy on its own. However you manage to get it on the ground, a pair of wheels at one end and a padded folding handle at the other do make it easy to pull along behind you, provided the terrain isn't too rough. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-multicooler-handle.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947216" /><br/>
I found operation to be pleasantly quiet, with BLUETTI saying it remains under 30 dB in fridge mode and under 45 dB in ice-making mode. To my ear in the real world, it's nearly inaudible in refrigeration mode, and I only occasionally notice the cooling kick on and off depending on how close I am to the unit. It's definitely louder in ice-making mode, but even that is a relatively low-level fan-like hum that isn't very disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AC180T Power Station</h2><br/>
What makes SwapSolar an ecosystem is the swappable batteries for running a variety of gadgets while away from other power options, and that's where BLUETTI's AC180T power station comes in. It's a high-capacity backup power station with two hot-swappable batteries that can either be used in the AC180T to power various gadgets via AC or USB or be removed to power other accessories like the MultiCooler. With the two B70 batteries included in the AC180T, the fridge can run for up to six days before the batteries need to be recharged.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-ac180t.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947220" /><br/>
Removing the batteries is as simple as flipping open the top lid of the power station and pressing a small spring-loaded button on the top of the battery, which allows it to be lifted straight out. The power station seamlessly continues to function with the other battery remaining inside, while the removed battery can be transferred to the MultiCooler to provide power for that device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-ac180t-open.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1100" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947223" /><br/>
The AC180T is capable of handling sustained loads of up to 1,200 watts with a single battery installed or up to 1,800 watts with two batteries installed, and it can handle transient spikes of up to 2,700 watts to support devices with high startup power draw. With a total capacity of 1,433.6 watt-hours, BLUETTI notes it can recharge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; over 120 times, but with four AC outlets and four USB ports (two USB-C and two USB-A), it can power an array of devices simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
A large multicolor LCD screen gives you all of the information you need at a glance, including the current charge level of the power station's batteries, input and output power draw, estimated time remaining until full charge or depletion, and more. Dedicated physical buttons control whether power is flowing to the AC outlets, the DC USB ports, or both, with the screen also offering an array of other status icons.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-ac180t-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="963" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947225" /><br/>
The AC180T barely flinched while recharging a MacBook Pro and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, as a power station this large is capable of much more. I was also able to run multiple lamps, an electric kettle, and a fan from it simultaneously, as long as I had both batteries installed. Trying to run my 1,500-watt electric kettle with only one battery installed tripped the protection system given the 1,200-watt limit with one battery, but it worked fine with two batteries installed.<br/>
<br/>
How long the available power will last is of course a direct function of how much load you're putting on the power station, but with over 1,400 Wh on board, there's plenty to go around for most items. Something like my electric kettle would quickly run through the power in under an hour of constant use, but it only needs to run for a few of minutes to produce a full pot of boiling water.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-ac180t-battery.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947242" /><br/>
Even with its high-capacity batteries, the AC180T can be recharged quickly, with AC wall power being the quickest method. BLUETTI says it can accept up to 1,440-watt input via AC, enough to fully recharge both batteries from empty in around 70 minutes. In my testing, I indeed saw power draw from the wall of over 1,000 watts, supporting rapid recharging of the system.<br/>
<br/>
In one portion of my testing, I ran through 50% of one battery in about 24 hours of use with the MultiCooler, so it wasn't quite on pace to meet the three-day target, although I ran quite a few ice-making cycles during that time and I'm sure that sapped a decent amount of power. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-ac180t-side.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947226" /><br/>
The AC180T also supports up to 500-watt charging from solar panel accessories, which BLUETTI says can fully recharge the batteries in under three hours. And if you're out on the road, you can use a 12-volt car power socket, although that will require more like eight hours for a full charge. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>BLUETTI App</h2><br/>
Both the MultiCooler and the AC180T power station are supported by the BLUETTI app, which lets you control them from your phone or Bluetooth. As long as you're within Bluetooth range, you'll have access to a good amount of data on the status of each product, as well most of the same controls (and in some cases more) that are available directly on the products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-app-setup.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1031" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947251" /><br/>
The app isn't the cleanest one around, as it's somewhat cluttered with widgets and features many users may not be interested in. The main Home tab includes a weather widget (which I can't seem to get to display accurate information for my location), an ad for current deals on BLUETTI products, and then a series of icons for accessing various functions. Core functions such as accessing existing devices, adding new devices, and accessing user manuals are obviously important, but others like a calculator to estimate how big of a power station you might need to buy should really be tucked away someplace more out of the way.<br/>
<br/>
And that's just the Home tab. A second tab offers access to the community forums, which you can't access until you've created an account for posting and even then the homepage of the forum mostly features ads and announcements about BLUETTI products. The third tab of the app offers access to the BLUETTI store, while a fourth one is where you can access support options and provide product feedback. The final tab is where you manage your BLUETTI account information, set your app preferences, and manage your referrals and rewards.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the app just feels too promotional and like it's trying to do too much. I just want quick access to my devices (you can pin one, but only one, to the app's Home screen), with the ability to dig into manuals and support options placed somewhere less prominent and other content like ads and community forums omitted from the app entirely.<br/>
<br/>
All of that said, I do find the app useful for monitoring my products, as it provides easy access to status and controls when I'm elsewhere in my house. You're of course limited to Bluetooth range, but it's good enough that I can check in on the MultiCooler and power station in my garage when I'm in a room on the second floor of my house.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluetti-app-multicooler-fridge.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1031" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947309" /><br/>
For the MultiCooler, you can see the current fridge temperature, adjust the set point, turn on ice making, set various ice-making options, start a self-cleaning cycle for the ice-making components, view power status, turn the entire unit on or off, and more. It really provides everything I need to see in a glanceable format with a relatively clean design.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/bluett-app-ac180t-double.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1031" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947310" /><br/>
For the AC180T, the app offers a graphical overview of power flow, showing current input from solar or the grid and output via AC and DC connections. You can turn the AC receptacles and DC USB ports off via the app, view the status of the installed batteries, and apply firmware updates to the batteries.<br/>
<br/>

The <a href="https://bluetti-swapsolar-an-ecosystem.kckb.st/66dc4294">Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for the SwapSolar system</a> is wrapping up in just a few days, and there are a number of tiers of perks with various combinations of products included, some of which are already shipping to backers and some of which will be shipping soon.<br/>
<br/>
The main combo is priced at &#36;1,719, a savings of 34% (over &#36;900) compared to the regular retail price, and it includes the MultiCooler, a B70 battery to power it, and the AC180T power station with two additional B70 batteries installed. Other combinations starting at &#36;569 for just the MultiCooler and &#36;849 for just the AC180T power station and batteries are also available, ranging up to &#36;2,099 for the full set plus a 200-watt solar panel.<br/>
<br/>
These are obviously some pricey packages, and there are certainly cheaper portable fridge options on the market, but BLUETTI's offerings include many more features and much more flexibility than most competing products. So for those looking for higher-end capabilities, BLUETTI's SwapSolar ecosystem may be an option worth looking at.<br/>
<br/>
The new SwapSolar system is just one of a <a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/PyGjJX">number of products available under the BLUETTI brand</a>, with the company primarily focused on portable power stations, home energy storage, and associated accessories.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After over a year of reports, there are now more than a dozen specific rumors about the features and improvements set to be offered by the two non-Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models later in 2024. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-15-vs-16-Feature-Yellow-Pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936647" /></div><br/>
All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their direct forerunners are listed below, using information from a range of reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
This guide focuses on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but to learn about how we are expecting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> to improve on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">see our other comparison article</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to largely carry over the design of their predecessors, meaning that they will have the same dimensions. The most noticeable alteration that will denote the new models is said to be a vertical rear camera arrangement to facilitate spatial video capture, but the removal of the mute switch in favor of the Action button introduced on last year's Pro models and the introduction of an all-new "Capture" button will also be important changes.<br/>
<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="chip_memory_and_connectivity">Chip, Memory, and Connectivity</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are rumored to benefit from a moderate improvement in processing power thanks to an all-new A18 chip with a more powerful Neural Engine to support exclusive generative AI capabilities. We are also expecting 33% more memory and Wi-Fi 6E support.<br/>

<br/>
<h3 id="batteries_and_charging">Batteries and Charging</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models could receive some major improvements in battery technology and charging, sporting denser batteries and faster charging capabilities. It is worth noting that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus is rumored to feature a smaller battery than its predecessor, but it is not clear how this will affect actual battery life. <br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are likely to receive several camera enhancements, such as spatial video capture for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>. While many of Apple's devices are rumored to receive a series of new AI-based features via software updates later this year, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to take these further with exclusive capabilities facilitated by a more powerful Neural Engine in the A18 chip and an upgraded microphone for voice commands.<br/>

<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; was a significant upgrade over 2023's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, introducing a new design with a the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a 48-megapixel camera, a USB-C port, and more. The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;'s upgrades will likely not be as substantial as those offered by its predecessor. As a result, most &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; users will have little reason to upgrade, but some who would appreciate AI features, improved performance, spatial video capture, and a dedicated button for photography and videography features may find it worthwhile.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16/">iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 16: 15+ Rumored Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16-15-rumored-upgrades-compared.2419705/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will debut a major revamp of the Calculator app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a> later this year, according to <em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/04/19/apples-macos-15-to-get-rare-cognitive-boost-via-project-greyparrot">AppleInsider</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/macOS-15-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-942568" /><br/>
<br/>
The overhauled version of the Calculator app for Mac will reportedly feature:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>An enhanced unit conversion system located in the main user interface, including for currency conversion with up-to-date exchange rates.</li><br/>
<li>"Math Notes" to allow the Notes app to communicate with the Calculator app in mathematical notation, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/ios-18-notes-app-voice-memos-math-rumors/">also coming to iOS 18</a>.</li><br/>
<li>A history tape in the sidebar to show previous calculations, likely accessible via a dedicated button on the top left, which also provides options to toggle between all three calculator views: Basic, scientific, and programmer.</li><br/>
<li>Adjustable window size across all three calculator views, with buttons that enlarge and change shape as needed.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The redesigned app will apparently offer a new design inspired by its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> counterpart in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, featuring rounded buttons. &zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj; is almost certain to be previewed alongside &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and Apple's other major software updates at WWDC on June 10, followed by official release in the fall.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/appleinsider-com/">AppleInsider</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/macos-15-revamped-calculator-app/">macOS 15 Rumored to Feature Revamped Calculator App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-15-rumored-to-feature-revamped-calculator-app.2424498/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another image of an alleged screen component designed for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> with a display was today shared by Kosutami, a source that has in the past shown off &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; components and abandoned Apple prototypes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/homepod-b720.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928024" /><br/>
The image shows a circular, glossy glass piece that would be located at the top of a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; that has the same design as the current standard size &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;. The component would replace the current touch/waveform interface, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/future-homepod-to-add-curved-lcd-display/">in the past</a>, Kosutami has suggested that the LCD display is slightly curved.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New picture of the (might be upcoming one) HomePod with display. <br>Glossy, sick, just imagine.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Apple</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#appleinternal</a> (B720) <a href="https://t.co/xMTULXpGw0">pic.twitter.com/xMTULXpGw0</a></p>&mdash; Kosutami (@Kosutami_Ito) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1781048272972575199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
There have been rumors about a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a display since 2021, and Apple actually seems to have several products in the works. The simplest is the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; that Kosutami and other leakers have referenced, which seems to be just a traditional speaker with a glass touchscreen. The display will show information from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> like the song that's playing, and it will allow for SharePlay and other features.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has said that Apple is working on a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; speaker with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/">an iPad-like display</a> and a built-in camera, and also a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a screen <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/">mounted on a robotic arm</a>. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">said in 2023</a> that Apple would release a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a 7-inch display at some point in 2024, though it doesn't look like that's happening at this point.<br/>
<br/>
It's not really clear when we're going to see a refreshed &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; at all, and it's possible that Apple is still just experimenting with a variety of designs. That said, the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a touch-responsive LCD display that uses the same design we have today does not seem farfetched, and it's plausible that such a product could come in the not too distant future.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/alleged-homepod-display-component/">Alleged HomePod Display Component Again Shown Off in Photo</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-homepod-display-component-again-shown-off-in-photo.2424460/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing to move its <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/saintecatherine/">retail store on Saint-Catherine Street</a> in Montréal, Québec, according to <a href="https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/marche-immobilier/2024-04-18/apple-demenage-mais-demeure-rue-sainte-catherine.php">Canadian newspaper <em>La Presse</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Sainte-Catherine-Montreal.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947306" /><em>The current Apple Sainte-Catherine store</em></div><br/>
The report cites three sources who said Apple will be opening a new retail store in a 125-year-old heritage building located at 1255 Saint-Catherine Street, which would be less than 100 meters away from the company's current store on the street. Apple's contractors are said to be in the process of completing major renovations to the building, which has been vacant for a few years after clothing retailer Ardene left the space.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last year reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/01/apple-store-update-plans/">considering relocating its Saint-Catherine store</a>. At the time, he said Apple aimed to open the new store in February 2025, but the timeframe could change. <em>La Presse</em> reported that Apple's current space on the street is already listed as available for lease online. Apple has not publicly announced any plans to relocate the store, and it did not respond to our inquiry.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/1255-Sainte-Catherine.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947311" /><em>1255 Sainte-Catherine Street (Image Credit: LoopNet)</em></div><br/>
Apple's existing two-floor store on Sainte-Catherine Street first opened in 2008, in Montréal's downtown Ville-Marie area. The store will be temporarily closed for one day on Tuesday, April 23, for reasons unclear, according to Apple's website.<br/>
<br/>
The new location would be Apple's first store within a historic building in Canada, with many of the company's other locations in the country found in indoor shopping malls. Apple recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/23/relocated-apple-square-one-opens/">relocated its store at the Square One shopping mall</a> in Mississauga, Ontario, just west of Toronto, as it continues to modernize its Canadian retail fleet.<br/>

The existing 10.9-inch iPad Air is equipped with a standard LCD panel, and the move to mini-LED technology for the 12.9-inch model would provide increased brightness for HDR content, deeper blacks, and more.<br/>

Young revealed this information <a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1780966729981845811">in a post</a> shared on social media platform X today. He said the 12.9-inch iPad Air will be using leftover mini-LED display panels from the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and he touted lower power consumption as another benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Given that Apple does not have existing inventory of 10.9-inch mini-LED display panels, it is likely that the smaller iPad Air will remain equipped with an LCD panel.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the next iPad Pro models are widely expected to transition to OLED displays, which would eliminate backlighting to allow for higher contrast ratio with true blacks, and provide other enhancements compared to LCD and mini-LED technologies. The new iPad Pro models are also expected to be announced in May.<br/>
