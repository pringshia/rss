		<description><![CDATA[Apple will adopt the same rear chassis manufacturing process for the iPhone SE 4 that it is using for the upcoming standard iPhone 16, claims a new rumor coming out of China.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iPhone-SE-4-Vertical-Camera-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959379" /><br/>
According to the Weibo-based leaker "<a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/Oof995QJj">Fixed Focus Digital</a>," the backplate manufacturing process for the iPhone SE 4 is "exactly the same" as the standard model in Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 lineup, which is expected to be released in September. The iPhone SE 4, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/when-to-expect-the-next-iphone-se/">expected</a> to arrive in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
The latest claim casts doubt on a previous rumor suggesting Apple would use a modified iPhone 14 chassis as the basis for a fourth-generation iPhone SE. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-se-4-iphone-14-chassis/">November 2023</a>, <em>MacRumors</em> learned from a source close to Apple's manufacturing process that the dimensions of the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 "perfectly matched" those of the base model ‌iPhone 14 <em>in its current stage</em>‌. <br/>
<br/>
While it's still unclear what may have led to the change, it's possible that Apple chose to adopt its newer rear chassis process for the more affordable SE model to achieve economy of scale at the point of production as the manufacture of iPhone 14 models winds down towards retirement. <br/>
<br/>
However, it could also indicate a change to the camera system on the fourth-generation iPhone SE. Unlike the ‌iPhone 14‌, the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 was previously rumored to include a single 48-megapixel rear camera with a custom backplate for the device to account for the design change. <br/>
<br/>
In contrast, for the iPhone 16 models, Apple is planning a new vertical camera lens arrangement that is a departure from the diagonal lens setup found on iPhone 15 models. The new orientation will presumably allow the standard iPhone 16 models to capture Spatial Video for the Vision Pro headset. Adopting the same backplate for the iPhone SE 4 would seem to suggest it will feature the same dual camera setup, although we haven't heard any rumors specifically claiming that this is in Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be targeting a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/iphone-se-4-face-id-price-rumor/">sub-&#36;500 starting price</a> for its fourth-generation iPhone SE model, despite a raft of rumored upgrades coming to the more affordable device. Touch ID and the Home button will be replaced by Face ID and a display notch, while the display size will increase from 4.7 inches to 6.1 inches. Other features expected for the next iPhone SE include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/">USB-C port and an Action button</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The third-generation iPhone SE was released in March 2022, so there is likely pent-up demand for a new model that includes some of the latest features of Apple's flagship iPhone models.

		<description><![CDATA[A widespread system failure is currently affecting numerous Windows devices globally, causing critical boot failures across various industries, including banks, rail networks, airlines, retailers, broadcasters, healthcare, and many more sectors. The issue, manifesting as a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), is preventing computers from starting up properly and forcing them into continuous recovery cycles.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bsod.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959336" /><br/>
The cause of the failure has been identified as an update to Crowdstrike Falcon antivirus software installed on Windows 10 PCs, but Mac and Linux machines running the same cybersecurity software have been spared. <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com">Crowdstrike</a>, which specializes in endpoint security protection for corporate networks, has just <a href="https://x.com/George_Kurtz/status/1814235001745027317">released the following statement</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>"Crowdstrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts.<br/>
<br/>
"Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack.<br/>
<br/>
"The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.<br/>
<br/>
"We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website.<br/>
<br/>
"We further recommend organisations ensure they're communicating with Crowdstrike representatives through official channels.<br/>
<br/>
"Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of Crowdstrike customers."</blockquote>Unfortunately, the nature of the problem means that fixing it isn't as simple as installing a patch. The workaround to break the infinite boot cycle on affected Windows machines involves manually booting into safe mode, navigating to the CrowdStrike directory, and deleting the system file that caused the problem. As such, it could be a while before all services impacted by the content update are back up and running. <br/>
<br/>
For those who have a Windows machine that has succumbed to the botched update (now rolled back), Crowdstrike has outlined the following steps system admins need to take to get back up and running: <br/>
<ol><li>Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment.</li><br/>
<li>Navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory.</li><br/>
<li>Locate the file matching 'C-00000291*.sys', and delete it.</li><br/>
<li>Boot the host normally.</li></ol><br/>
As expected, Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/">system status webpage</a> shows no issues with its services, however there have been scattered reports of problems with contactless payments across some businesses, which could prevent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> transactions from being processed.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows/">Windows</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/19/global-it-outage-limited-to-windows-pcs/">Crowdstrike Says Global IT Outage Impacting Windows PCs, But Mac and Linux Hosts Not Affected</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/crowdstrike-says-global-it-outage-impacting-windows-pcs-but-mac-and-linux-hosts-not-affected.2431738/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Smart home company Eve Systems today announced the launch of a new version of the Eve Weather that offers Matter support. With Matter, the new Eve Weather can be added to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> or smart home setups from other companies.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/eve-weather.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959321" /><br/>
Eve Weather is a small cube-shaped accessory that is designed to provide outdoor weather temperature, humidity, and the local 12-hour weather trend. A display at the front allows you to see temperature and humidity at a glance, but the data also syncs to the Eve app.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; integration, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> can be used to provide details on the outdoor weather conditions, and the data can be used to trigger &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; automations. Eve Weather offers IPX4 water resistance so it can be kept outdoors year-round and displayed anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Eve Weather can be purchased <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us">from the Eve website</a> or <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEve-Weather-Matter-temperature-resistance%2Fdp%2FB0D81BVH6P">from Amazon.com</a> for &#36;80. Eve is continuing to sell the &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; version of the device as well for those who do not have a Matter-enabled hub, which includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/matter/">Matter</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/eve-weather-matter-support/">Eve Launches Matter-Enabled Eve Weather Smart Station</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eve-launches-matter-enabled-eve-weather-smart-station.2431717/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix has gained more than 8 million global paid subscribers since April, according to new subscriber information included in the company's second quarter earnings results [<a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/FINAL-Q2-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">PDF</a>]. With the jump in paid subscriptions, Netflix now has a total of 277.65 million paid subscribers around the world, marking 16.5 percent year-over-year growth.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884791" /><br/>
Ad tier memberships increased 34 percent quarter-over-quarter, thanks to Netflix pushing its ad-supported tier. Netflix eliminated its cheapest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/netflix-removes-basic-plan/">ad-free "Basic" subscription tier</a> last year, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/03/netflix-phasing-out-basic-ads-free-plan/">earlier in July</a>, the company began warning customers in the UK and Canada that they would need to move to a new plan.<br/>
<br/>
In the United States, the Basic plan was priced at &#36;9.99 per month, but the cheapest ad-free Netflix plan is now priced at &#36;15.49 a month. Netflix had been allowing customers that were already on the Basic plan to continue using it, but that is being phased out. Ad tier memberships grew 34 percent from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix with ads is priced at &#36;6.99 per month, and it includes between four and five minutes of ads per hour. Ads vary in length from 15 to 30 seconds and play before and during TV shows and movies. The company says that it will soon test an in-house ad tech platform in Canada, with plans to launch it broadly in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix saw 17 percent growth in revenue year-over-year, and it is expecting overall 2024 growth to be at 14 to 15 percent. Netflix is expecting ad memberships to increase in 2025 and beyond, with ad revenue becoming a more meaningful contributor to its business.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/netflix-global-subscriber-increase-ads/">Netflix Gains 8 Million Global Subscribers Amid Price Hikes and Push to Ad-Supported Streaming</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-gains-8-million-global-subscribers-amid-price-hikes-and-push-to-ad-supported-streaming.2431710/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most iPhone-connected smart home products are more for convenience than fun, but Bird Buddy, a bird feeder that sends pictures to your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, is definitely in the latter category. When I first came across the Bird Buddy, I thought it would be an interesting novelty product to give as a gift, but it turned out to be one of my all-time favorite smart devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-main-image.jpg" alt="" width="1630" height="917" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959300" /><br/>
<h2>Design and Components</h2><br/>
Made from a sturdy plastic material, the Bird Buddy comes in either blue or yellow. The housing is designed around a camera, which is placed front and center to capture images of birds that come by to eat from the feeder. A tray holds the seed, and there's a small perch for birds to stand on to eat. There's a seed reservoir at the back to replenish what's in the tray as it's consumed, and a roof protects the seed from the elements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-components.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959301" /><br/>
There are two versions of the Bird Buddy, one with a solar roof for charging the camera and one with a standard plastic roof. If you have a semi-sunny spot for the Bird Buddy, I recommend the solar roof. I have my feeder in a spot that gets several hours of sun per day, and I've never had to take the camera out to charge it. A family member also has the solar model (that I gifted), and it is in a much shadier spot. With the shade cover, the Bird Buddy needs to be charged every month to every other month.<br/>
<br/>
Both of these feeders see multiple visits per day, though the one located in the shade that needs charging more often has an almost constant stream of bird visitors. Without a solar roof, Bird Buddy says that the battery lasts for 5 to 15 days, so the solar roof does eliminate the hassle of frequent charging.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-camera.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959302" /><br/>
The Bird Buddy disassembles into its component pieces for charging and cleaning. You can remove the camera module and bring it into the house, but doing so requires taking the feeder down, opening up the back, and pulling the camera out. It charges with USB-C, and takes two to four hours to charge to full. With the solar roof, you connect the USB-C port on the Bird Buddy to the USB-C port on the solar charger, so you could do the same thing with a DIY setup, adding your own solar panel. Alternatively, you could use an extension cord and keep it plugged in all the time, though Bird Buddy only recommends this for protected areas like a balcony.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-assembly.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959309" /><br/>
Setup wasn't difficult, but the lights on the Bird Buddy are super hard to see, so when you need a blinking red light to pair, it's hard to tell that it's blinking. I didn't have issues other than that, and with the solar version, it's a little tricky getting the camera plugged in. You need to connect the USB-C cable from the solar panel to the Bird Buddy camera, routing the cable through a small spot a the top of the feed bin. I was worried about this set up, but it's held up to heavy rain and the cabling has not gotten wet.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-setup-process.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1071" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959303" /><br/>
Along with the solar roof, camera module, and feeder housing, the Bird Buddy comes with a seed scoop for adding bird seed, a hanger, and a pole mount, so there are multiple options for mounting. I bought a pole from Wild Birds Unlimited that I read on the internet was compatible with the mount, but it was not, so I hung it up. If you want to mount the Bird Buddy on a pole, you will need a pole with a 0.97-inch inner diameter (a common size).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-design.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959304" /><br/>
Size wise, the Bird Buddy is comparable to smaller bird feeders on the market, and it holds about four cups of seed in the reservoir and tray. In my experience, that's about a pound of bird seed. Adding and refilling seed can be done by opening up the back hatch and using the seed scoop to pour it in. I only need to refill around once every two weeks or so because I have other bird feeders, but that will vary based on how many visitors you're getting.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-solar-roof.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959307" /><br/>
You need to make sure the Bird Buddy is in range of your Wi-Fi router because it does need a constant Wi-Fi connection and a 2.4GHz band.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Add-Ons</h2><br/>
The size of the seed tray and the small size of the included perch will likely limit most visits to smaller birds like finches and sparrows, but Bird Buddy sells a perch extender for &#36;24. I did go ahead and pick this up, and I like it because it gives the birds more space to perch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-add-ons.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1516" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959305" /><br/>
There's also a 3-in-1 nutrition set for &#36;29, but I wasn't a fan of it. It includes an add-on seed/water dish that you can use for seeds or jelly, or attach to an included water bottle. There's also a set of prongs where you can add an orange or another fruit if you want to attract orioles. You can only use one of these at a time, and while the tray itself was fine, the water bottle took up too much perch space and blocked the camera.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-seed-pourer.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959306" /><br/>
For &#36;14, you can get a suet ball holder too, which can attract more types of birds. The suet ball also blocks the camera somewhat, so it's a bit of a tradeoff. If you want to mount the Bird Buddy to the wall, you'll need the &#36;24 Wall Mount, which is not included with the base purchase.<br/>
<br/>
If you have access to a 3D printer, I have seen several Bird Buddy STLs for add-on perches and seed holders, plus neat options like a fence to keep birds from perching and eating out of view.<br/>
<br/>
There is no built-in protection from squirrels, raccoons, and other critters on the Bird Buddy, which is a downside. You either need to have a setup that puts the feeder out of range of these creatures or you need to accept them as visitors. The pole that I use has a baffle that blocks squirrels from climbing it, and it seems to be far enough away from nearby surfaces so the squirrels can't leap to the feeder. Bird Buddy does not sell poles or baffles at this time, though it looks like there's going to be a pole setup released later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-bird-feeder.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959312" /><br/>
While Bird Buddy sells birdseed, any kind of bird food can go in the device. There are some limitations, like full-sized in-shell peanuts likely wouldn't fit because of the opening size, but any kind of bird seed or meal worm mix should work. I have not tried the Bird Buddy bird seed, as I've just bought seed locally from a nearby bird store.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bird Visits</h2><br/>
It took a good two weeks for birds to start visiting my Bird Buddy after I set it up, and there are placement considerations to take into account. Bird Buddy's website has <a href="https://mybirdbuddy.com/ultimate-guide/">instructions and tips</a> on attracting birds. In addition to being positioned to keep squirrels and similar critters away, the Bird Buddy will be more successful near a water source like a bird bath and with trees and bushes that birds can hide in to escape predators.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="495" height="880" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t8ATklej98s" title="Bird Buddy Demo Video" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
I don't have the Bird Buddy in the most ideal location because I wanted it near a window where my cat can watch it, but it's still attracting birds, so there's some wiggle room. I have a cohort of house finches that dominate my bird feeders right now, but I have seen a goldfinch a few times and a wren. There are robins and a ton of other birds around, but the combination of nearness to my windows, a nearby resident hawk, and the finches are keeping them away.<br/>
<br/>
A family member who has a Bird Buddy much further than the house near a forested area gets frequent cardinal, dove, and sparrow visits, plus we've seen bluebirds, nuthatches, chickadees, and towhees.<br/>
<br/>

You could probably put it anywhere and have good luck on bird visits, though the most variety will come with offering the best conditions and food options.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bird Buddy App</h2><br/>
The Bird Buddy is just a bird feeder with a camera, and there are many on the market, but it's the app that elevates the experience and sets it apart. Bird Buddy is able to recognize the birds that are visiting your feeder, letting you know what kind of bird you're getting, so it becomes a fun game trying to attract new birds. I was <em>thrilled</em> when I recently had visits from a pair of goldfinches.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-postcards.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1434" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959313" /><br/>
It's a lot of fun to get an alert about a new type of bird, and you can collect snapshots of your favorites so you can keep a log of the species that you've seen.<br/>
<br/>
While you can view a livestream of the Bird Buddy, it's mostly set up to take snapshots when birds visit and then send "postcards" for you to view at various times throughout the day. Postcards include several photos and a video of the visit, and they are limited to the best images captured so that Bird Buddy doesn't send an excessive number of notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-livestream.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="2152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959314" /><br/>
I get between two and four notifications a day, usually a couple visit notifications and then a wrap-up notification at the end of the day. Bird Buddy will also sometimes send notifications for a feeding frenzy so you can tune in and watch live. In the app, there are notification customization settings. Smart push notifications (the default) alert you to only the most "essential and intriguing updates" with an end-of-day recap, but there is an option to get all push notifications.<br/>
<br/>
There are separate battery preserving options that change how many postcards you get, so at max, you'll see more recordings. You can also ignore mystery visitors (where a bird can't be identified), or ignore a certain type of bird if you see the same thing over and over again. Notifications can also be paused for a set period of time, so there's a lot of control over what the app is sending.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to viewing your own Bird Buddy, you can be invited to receive postcards from other Bird Buddy owners, and you can invite people to see yours. You can invite three people to view your Bird Buddy feed, but with a Pro subscription, you can add 10 additional viewers. You can also choose to join popular bird feeders for a 72-hour period, where you receive postcards from that feeder. Pictures that you get from the Bird Buddy app can be saved to your smartphone, shared with other people, and shared on social media.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-snapshots.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1317" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959311" /><br/>
Bird Buddy has a "BB TV" feed where you can see videos from all around the world, swiping through them to swap to a new video, sort of like birdie TikTok. It's a fun way to see different birds, and to get a look at what kinds of birds might be in your own area that you can attract. You can save postcards, and tap into the Collection section of the app to see your images.<br/>
<br/>
Viewing an image in the Collection provides information on that bird species, such as their favorite foods, where they're found, fun facts, personality traits, and lifespan. There are even recordings of their songs and calls.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-collection.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1434" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959315" /><br/>
You don't need a subscription to use the Bird Buddy app, but there are some "Pro" features. I bought a Pro subscription, but I'm not sure if it's something that I'll keep using.<br/>
<br/>
Pro lets you invite more people to your own feeder, view more remote feeders, ignore select bird species (possibly one of the most useful options), see higher-resolution video recordings, and get more postcards with frenzy mode. There are also new AI options that are still in the early stages of development. Bird Buddy can alert you to sick birds and hide their images, but since turning it on, it's been telling me every bird with a messy food beak is ill, which is inaccurate. I ultimately had to turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-feeds.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1432" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959316" /><br/>
There's also a feature for "naming" frequent visitors, which I've been testing. I've named several of the house finches that come by, but Bird Buddy can't really tell them apart, which is not surprising because I'm not sure I can either. It will send a notification asking if a bird is a certain one that you've named, but it's up to you to confirm by comparing photographs. I have three female finches that I've named, but it only ever asks about one, so it's not a feature I've found particularly useful. You can get alerts about non-bird spottings like squirrels and lizards with Pro, and connect to Amazon Alexa devices to see images and hear bird sounds to bring the outdoors inside.<br/>
<br/>
Other standard app features include notifications for cleaning and charging, assembly and maintenance documents, and Bird Buddy support.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-ai-features.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="2121" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959310" /><br/>
Note that you need the Bird Buddy app to use the feeder and view the feed. It is not available for viewing on the web, and there is no Mac/PC version of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
The Bird Buddy is a lot of fun. I initially got one as a gift for someone who is hard to shop for, and it turned out to be a hit. We have regular conversations about bird visits, bird food, and thwarting squirrels. I'd definitely recommend it for that kind of situation, and any nature lover or gardener would likely be thrilled with it.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy my daily postcard recap and checking out the birds that have visited over the course of the day, even when it's a bird I've seen dozens of times (aka house finches). There are bird squabbles, messy eating videos, acrobatics, and other activity to get into. I've found myself searching for the optimal bird food, adding additional bird feeders, and researching birds nearby, so it can get a little involved.<br/>
<br/>
On the downside, the Bird Buddy is expensive (definitely wait for a sale), and there are no size options if you want to attract bigger birds or use other kinds of feeders with the camera. The subscription features are a little hit or miss, and some of the new AI additions are very much in the early stages of development.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of bundle options, but I'd recommended the solar roof model and the add-on extended perch over the other add-ons.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2><br/>
The Bird Buddy can be purchased from <a href="https://mybirdbuddy.com/shop/">the Bird Buddy website</a> or <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBird-Feeder-Resolution-Beautiful-Experience%2Fdp%2FB0C8TJTBMR">from Amazon</a>. It is priced at &#36;239 for the standard model and &#36;299 for the model with a solar roof, though there are often sales.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/07/new-apple-immersive-video-series-and-films-premiere-on-vision-pro/">today announced</a> the upcoming debut of multiple new immersive video experiences designed for the Vision Pro headset, which are available starting this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/apple-immersive-video-boundless.jpeg" alt="" width="1960" height="1224" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959296" /><br/>
"Boundless," which premieres tonight at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time, features "once-in-a-lifetime trips," starting with a hot air balloon ride episode. Viewers will be able to see the landscape of Cappadocia, Türkiye. A second episode, "Arctic Surfing," will come out this fall.<br/>
<br/>
In August, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> will get a new installment of "Wild Life," a nature documentary series that brings viewers up close to "some of the most charismatic creatures on the planet." The new episode will feature Kenya's Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, where keepers look after orphaned elephants. An episode later in the year will feature a group of divers in the Bahamas.<br/>
<br/>
In September, Apple will debut the first episode of "Elevated," an aerial travel series that "whisks viewers around iconic vistas from staggering heights" that include volcanoes, waterfalls, and more in Hawaii. A second episode will feature an autumn scene in New England.<br/>
<br/>
Later in 2024, Apple also plans to introduce a new immersive performance from The Weeknd, as well as a scripted Apple Immersive short film called "Submerged." The short film is set during World War II, featuring sailors struggling to survive a deadly torpedo attack. There will also be a behind-the-scenes view of the 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend, and a new sports series called Big-Wave Surfing.<br/>
<blockquote>"Apple Immersive Video is a groundbreaking leap forward for storytelling, offering Apple Vision Pro users remarkable experiences with an unparalleled sense of realism and immersion," said Tor Myhren, Apple's vice president of Marketing Communications. "From soaring over volcanoes in Hawaii and surfing huge waves in Tahiti, to enjoying performances by the world's biggest artists and athletes from all-new perspectives, Apple Immersive Video revolutionizes the way people experience places, stories, sports, and more by making viewers feel like they're truly there. It's the next generation of visual storytelling, and we're excited to bring it to more people around the world."</blockquote><br/>
The new Apple Immersive video content is available from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S. Users in China can watch the content through the Migu Video and Tencent Video apps.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/apple-immersive-videos-vision-pro/">Apple Launching New Apple Immersive Videos, Films and Concerts for Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launching-new-apple-immersive-videos-films-and-concerts-for-vision-pro.2431680/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple does not appear to have increased <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> orders despite reports to the contrary, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/although-there-have-been-rumors-of-increased-orders-for-iphone-16-orders-from-time-to-time-after-4281627f2536">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo cites recent earnings reports from Apple suppliers TSMC and Largan as evidence.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935159" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Colors.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" /><br/>
TSMC recently said that it did not see an increase in unit growth, while Largan said that orders for high-end models in 2024 are similar to last year. Kuo believes that Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; orders for the second half of 2024 are around 87 million units, which is lower than the 91 million <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> units that Apple ordered in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said that certain suppliers may have been asked to increase production, but that may be related to "specific reasons within individual industries or components."<br/>
<br/>
He suggests that expectations that Apple Intelligence will drive &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; sales "may be too optimistic" as the feature is available in U.S. English only.<br/>
<blockquote>The launch of Apple Intelligence is generally considered to be the reason for the increase in iPhone 16 orders. However, Apple Intelligence will only be available in Beta for US users in 2H24, and Apple Intelligence Siri only supports English. Regardless of whether Apple Intelligence alone can drive replacement demand (which is another big topic), the expectation that consumers will buy the new iPhone 16 for the Beta version of Apple Intelligence in 2H24 may be too optimistic.</blockquote><br/>
Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em> suggested that Apple was counting on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> AI features to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/apple-ai-iphone-16-shipment-boost/">boost iPhone shipments</a> by 10 percent in 2024. Apple Intelligence requires an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or later, so customers with an older <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> will need to upgrade to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; to get the technology.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence includes a long list of new capabilities, including Writing Tools for proofreading, polishing, and summarizing text, Image Playground for generating images, and Genmoji for creating custom emoji. Apple Intelligence will also be used to overhaul <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, but the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality isn't slated to launch until 2025.<br/>
<br/>
So far, Apple has not established an AI deal for Chinese consumers, and Apple Intelligence will also not be coming to the European Union when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; launches.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/kuo-no-iphone-16-ai-demand-increase/">Kuo: Expectation That Apple Intelligence Will Drive iPhone 16 Sales &#039;May Be Too Optimistic&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-expectation-that-apple-intelligence-will-drive-iphone-16-sales-may-be-too-optimistic.2431677/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Steve Jobs Archive today <a href="https://stevejobsarchive.com/exhibits/objects-of-our-life">shared never-before-seen footage</a> of 28-year-old Steve Jobs speaking at the 1983 International Design Conference in Aspen, Colorado. His speech was focused on the future of computers and how they would change daily life.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Steve-Jobs-Younger.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959273" /><br/>
The Steve Jobs Archive was launched in 2022 by Laurene Powell Jobs, Tim Cook, and Jony Ive. The website features a collection of quotes, photos, videos, and emails from Jobs, and offers fellowships to young creators looking to follow in his footsteps.<br/>
<br/>
The new page features an introduction from Ive, who led design at Apple for over two decades and was a close friend of Jobs:<blockquote>Steve rarely attended design conferences. This was 1983, before the launch of the Mac, and still relatively early days of Apple. I find it breathtaking how profound his understanding was of the dramatic changes that were about to happen as the computer became broadly accessible. Of course, beyond just being prophetic, he was fundamental in defining products that would change our culture and our lives forever. <br/>
<br/>
On the eve of launching the first truly personal computer, Steve is not solely preoccupied with the founding technology and functionality of the product’s design. This is extraordinarily unusual, as in the early stages of dramatic innovation, it is normally the primary technology that benefits from all of the attention and focus.<br/>
<br/>
Steve points out that the design effort in the U.S. at the time had been focused on the automobile, with little consideration or effort given to consumer electronics. While it is not unusual to hear leaders talk about the national responsibility to manufacture, I thought it was interesting that he talked about a nation’s responsibility to design.<br/>
<br/>
In the talk, Steve predicts that by 1986 sales of the PC would exceed sales of cars, and that in the following ten years, people would be spending more time with a PC than in a car. These were absurd claims for the early 1980s. Describing what he sees as the inevitability that this would be a pervasive new category, he asks the designers in the audience for help. He asks that they start to think about the design of these products, because designed well or designed poorly, they still would be made.<br/>
<br/>
Steve remains one of the best educators I’ve ever met in my life. He had that ability to explain incredibly abstract, complex technologies in terms that were accessible, tangible and relevant. You hear him describe the computer as doing nothing more than completing fairly mundane tasks, but doing so very quickly. He gives the example of running out to grab a bunch of flowers and returning by the time you could snap your fingers – speed rendering the task magical.<br/>
<br/>
When I look back on our work, what I remember most fondly are not the products but the process. Part of Steve’s brilliance was how he learned to support the creative process, encouraging and developing ideas even in large groups of people. He treated the process of creating with a rare and wonderful reverence.<br/>
<br/>
The revolution Steve described over 40 years ago did of course happen, partly because of his profound commitment to a kind of civic responsibility. He cared, way beyond any sort of functional imperative. His was a victory for beauty, for purity and, as he would say, for giving a damn. He truly believed that by making something useful, empowering and beautiful, we express our love for humanity.</blockquote>Head to <a href="https://stevejobsarchive.com/exhibits/objects-of-our-life">"The Objects of Our Life" page</a> to learn more about the speech that Jobs gave, and to view some related photos and exhibits from that time.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is in active talks to license more films from major Hollywood studios as it seeks to bolster <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/apple-is-in-talks-to-license-more-films-from-hollywood"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-TV-Plus-Feature-2-Dark-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-959287" /><br/>
Apple has traditionally focused on original productions for its streaming platform, but it is increasingly looking to expand its offerings by acquiring programming from the extensive libraries of established studios, sources familiar with the matter claim. While &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; has seen some success with original series such as "Ted Lasso" and "The Morning Show," these hits have been relatively few and far between, and the service has struggled to match the extensive catalogs of competitors like Netflix and Disney+.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; launched in November 2019, positioning itself as a premium service with a slate of high-quality, original content. Despite receiving critical acclaim and numerous awards, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/apple-earns-record-72-emmy-award-nominations/">72 Emmy nominations this year</a>, &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; has not garnered the same subscriber base as its competitors. According to the research firm MoffettNathanson, only 11% of U.S. households use &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj;, compared to 55% for Netflix. The limited scope of content available on &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; is apparently seen as a significant factor contributing to its slower growth. Data from Antenna indicates that streaming services with larger content libraries, like Netflix, experience lower cancellation rates. <br/>
<br/>
In an effort to address this, Apple has already begun experimenting with licensing. Earlier this year, the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-tv-gains-over-50-movies-for-a-limited-time/">licensed approximately 50 movies</a> from Hollywood studios for its service in the United States, adding popular titles such as "Mean Girls" and "Titanic" to its catalog. The positive reception to this initial batch of licensed films is said to have encouraged Apple to pursue additional deals. These discussions aim to license even more titles, potentially expanding the service's offerings internationally as well as domestically. Simultaneously, major studios such as Warner Bros., Discovery, and Disney are increasingly open to selling their content to rivals to boost revenue.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/apple-looking-to-license-more-movies/">Apple Looking to License More Movies to Expand Apple TV+ Library</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-looking-to-license-more-movies-to-expand-apple-tv-library.2431664/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/dyson-ontrack-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-959226" /><br/>
The new headphones represent a significant shift from Dyson's previous attempt, the Dyson Zone, which combined noise-canceling headphones with an air purifying mask. Priced at &#36;499.99, the OnTrac headphones are designed with a modular approach that allows users to replace the ear cushions and outer caps, enabling over 2,000 potential color combinations. <br/>
<br/>
One of the standout features of the OnTrac is its active noise cancellation (ANC). Dyson employs an eight-microphone system that samples external noise 384,000 times per second, aiming to provide what it claims is best-in-class noise cancellation. This system is comparable to Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, which also uses multiple microphones for ANC, although the exact sampling rate of the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; is not known. The OnTrac's ANC is designed to block up to 40 decibels of noise, enhancing the listening experience in noisy environments.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In terms of battery life, the OnTrac headphones offer 55 hours of continuous listening on a single charge with ANC enabled. This surpasses the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, which provides up to 20 hours of battery life with ANC and spatial audio enabled. Dyson achieves this extended battery life by housing two high-capacity lithium-ion cells in the headband, which also helps distribute weight evenly for comfort. Charging is facilitated via a USB-C port, and a 10-minute quick charge can provide up to 2.5 hours of playback.<br/>
<br/>
The OnTrac headphones are equipped with 40mm drivers that reproduce frequencies from as low as 6Hz to as high as 21kHz. This wide frequency range aims to deliver deep bass and clear highs, with the drivers angled towards the ears for more direct audio delivery. In comparison, the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; feature custom-built 40mm dynamic drivers and support a frequency range from 20Hz to 20kHz. While both sets of headphones aim to provide high-fidelity sound, the OnTrac's extended frequency range may offer more detailed audio, particularly in the low-end frequencies.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The OnTrac headphones also feature a unique control system, including a joystick for playback control and touch-sensitive ear cups for toggling ANC. The MyDyson app allows users to monitor noise exposure levels and customize the EQ settings with presets like Bass Boost, Enhanced, and Natural.<br/>
<br/>
The OnTrac includes replaceable ear cushions and outer caps, available in various colors and finishes, allowing users to deeply customize the look of their headphones. The headphones come in four main colorways at launch: CNC Aluminum with bright yellow ear cushions, CNC Copper with purple headband and copper ear cups, Ceramic Cinnabar with a light red headband and matte ear cups, and CNC Black Nickel with an all-black design.<br/>
<br/>
The OnTrac headphones will be available from Dyson's website starting on August 1, with additional customization options sold separately. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dyson/">Dyson</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/dyson-ontrac-headphones-rival-airpods-max/">Dyson&#039;s New OnTrac Headphones Rival AirPods Max With 55-Hour Battery Life and Customization Options</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dysons-new-ontrac-headphones-rival-airpods-max-with-55-hour-battery-life-and-customization-options.2431660/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a humorous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbYckRAt5os">new video on its YouTube channel</a> that dramatizes many of the uses of Apple devices, including its Apple Vision Pro spatial computing device.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbYckRAt5os?si=KavZs80xSDHHOxt7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Titled "OOO (Out of Office)," the 10-minute video follows design team "The Underdogs" as they travel to Thailand in a last-ditch attempt fulfill a client's wishes. In order to do so, they must find a new packaging factory, solve last-minute design changes, create prototypes, break down language barriers, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has shared longer ads in the past featuring "The Underdogs" design team racing against time to fulfill the needs of a client, but this is the first one to feature one of the characters using an Apple Vision Pro headset to multi-task across several open windows in virtual space.<br/>
<br/>
The short comes after similar "Apple at Work" videos that Apple published in 2019, 2020, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-security-at-work-video-short/">2023</a> using the same actors.

		<description><![CDATA[Israel-based mobile forensics company <a href="https://cellebrite.com/en">Cellebrite</a> is unable to unlock iPhones running iOS 17.4 or later, according to leaked documents verified by <em><a href="https://404media.co/leaked-docs-show-what-phones-cellebrite-can-and-cant-unlock/">404 Media</a></em>. The documents provide a rare glimpse into the capabilities of the company's mobile forensics tools and highlight the ongoing security improvements in Apple's latest devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/iphone-14-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2458" height="1355" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862499" /><br/>
The leaked "<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24833832-cellebrite-ios-document-april-2024?ref=404media.co">Cellebrite iOS Support Matrix</a>" obtained by <em>404 Media</em> reveals that for all locked iPhones capable of running iOS 17.4 or newer, Cellebrite's status is listed as "In Research," indicating they cannot reliably unlock these devices with their current tools. This limitation likely extends to a significant portion of modern iPhones, as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/?ref=404media.co">Apple's own data from June</a> shows that 77% of all iPhones and 87% of iPhones introduced in the last four years are running some version of iOS 17.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, the documents indicate that Cellebrite recently added support for the iPhone XR and iPhone 11 series running iOS 17.1 to 17.3.1. However, for iPhone 12 and newer models running these same iOS versions, the status is listed as "Coming soon," suggesting Cellebrite's continuing attempts to keep pace with Apple's security advancements.<br/>
<br/>
Another document shows that Cellebrite can break into most Android devices, but not all of them. Cellebrite cannot, for example, brute force a turned-off Google Pixel 6, 7, or 8 to get the users' data. <br/>
<br/>
The revelation comes despite Cellebrite's marketing claims that their Premium service, which offers additional capabilities, can obtain passcodes for "nearly all of today's mobile devices, including the latest iOS and Android versions." <br/>
<br/>
Cellebrite's <a href="https://cellebrite.com/en/ufed/">Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED)</a> is widely used by law enforcement agencies worldwide for extracting data from mobile phones. Cellebrite first garnered significant attention in 2016, when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/23/fbi-israeli-firm-cellebrite-to-unlock-iphone/">it was believed</a> the company was enlisted to help the FBI break into the ‌iPhone‌ 5c of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook after Apple refused to provide the FBI with tools to unlock the device.<br/>
<br/>
The FBI <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/12/iphone-5c-flaw-fbi-professional-hackers/">did not use</a> Cellebrite's services for that particular case, but several US government agencies do regularly <a href="http://government-contractors.insidegov.com/l/217606/Cellebrite-Inc">work with Cellebrite to unlock iOS devices</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Apple continually introduces improvements to the security of its operating systems in order to keep ahead of companies like Cellebrite that are always searching for flaws and vulnerabilities to exploit in order to access the data on locked iOS devices.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in October 2018 Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/24/graykey-iphone-unlocking-box-disabled-by-ios-12/">successfully thwarted</a> the "GrayKey" ‌iPhone‌ passcode hack, sold by Atlanta-based company Grayshift, which had also been in use by U.S. law enforcement.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/security/">Security</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cellebrite/">Cellebrite</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/cellebrite-unable-to-unlock-iphones-on-ios-17-4/">Cellebrite Unable to Unlock iPhones on iOS 17.4 or Later, Leak Reveals</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cellebrite-unable-to-unlock-iphones-on-ios-17-4-or-later-leak-reveals.2431651/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Thursday addressed concerns about its use of AI training data, following an investigation that revealed Apple, along with other major tech companies, had used YouTube subtitles to train their artificial intelligence models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
The investigation by <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-training-data-apple-nvidia-anthropic/">Wired</a></em> earlier this week reported that over 170,000 videos from popular content creators were part of a dataset used to train AI models. Apple specifically used this dataset in the development of its open-source OpenELM models, which were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/apple-ai-open-source-models/">made public in April</a>.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple has now confirmed to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/17/apple-intelligence-openelm-training-youtube/">9to5Mac</a></em> that OpenELM does not power any of its AI or machine learning features, including the company's Apple Intelligence system. Apple clarified that OpenELM was created solely for research purposes, with the aim of advancing open-source large language model development.<br/>
<br/>
On releasing OpenELM on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM">Hugging Face Hub</a>, a community for sharing AI code, Apple researchers described it as a "state-of-the-art open language model" that had been designed to "empower and enrich the open research community." The model is also available through Apple's <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com">Machine Learning Research website</a>. Apple has stated that it has no plans to develop new versions of the OpenELM model.<br/>
<br/>
The company emphasized that since OpenELM is not integrated into Apple Intelligence, the "YouTube Subtitles" dataset is not being used to power any of its commercial AI features. Apple reiterated its previous statement that Apple Intelligence models are trained on "licensed data, including data selected to enhance specific features, as well as publicly available data collected by our web-crawler."<br/>
<br/>
The <em>Wired</em> report detailed how companies including Apple, Anthropic, and NVIDIA had used the "YouTube Subtitles" dataset for AI model training. This dataset is part of a larger collection known as "The Pile," which is compiled by the non-profit organization EleutherAI.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/apple-intelligence-not-trained-on-youtube/">Apple Intelligence Not Trained on YouTube Content, Says Apple</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-not-trained-on-youtube-content-says-apple.2431646/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 199 includes fixes and updates for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, CSS, Editing, JavaScript, Media, Rendering, and WebRTC.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> beta, the newest version of macOS that Apple is beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[If you have an old Apple Watch and you're not sure what to do with it, a new product called <a href="https://thetinypod.com">TinyPod</a> might be the answer. Priced at &#36;79, the TinyPod is a silicone case with a built-in scroll wheel that houses the Apple Watch chassis.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/tinypod-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959183" /><br/>
When an Apple Watch is placed inside the TinyPod, the click wheel on the case is able to be used to scroll through the Apple Watch interface. The feature works through "carefully mechanized components" that make direct contact with the Digital Crown on Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
The TinyPod website suggests that a cellular version of the Apple Watch could be placed inside the TinyPod and used as a miniature phone, without the need to carry an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The case leaves the back of the Apple Watch exposed, but it is worth noting that actually using an Apple Watch this way would be frustrating because it uses skin contact for authentication.<br/>
<br/>
If the TinyPod were tucked away in a pocket, the Apple Watch would need to be unlocked with a passcode every time it was used, since there is no <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or Touch Id. The alternative would be leaving the watch unlocked without a passcode, but that's not particularly secure.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say hello to tinyPod! Available now at <a href="https://t.co/v0B49YxW5g">https://t.co/v0B49YxW5g</a> <a href="https://t.co/6LpGytwoQ1">pic.twitter.com/6LpGytwoQ1</a></p>&mdash;  (@thetinypod) <a href="https://twitter.com/thetinypod/status/1813589903722311784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Using TinyPod requires turning off wrist detection, which is the feature that keeps the Apple Watch unlocked with skin contact. TinyPod positions this as a bonus that allows for longer multi-day battery life, but at the same time highlights <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> and Name Drop, features that would require authentication via passcode. With the back of the Apple Watch exposed, charging can be done with a standard Apple Watch charging puck.<br/>
<br/>
TinyPod is available in 40/41mm, 44/45mm, and 49mm sizes to fit all Apple Watch models. It is compatible with the Series 4 and later, as well as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> and Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
TinyPod's creators introduced it earlier this year, but the device is now available for purchase. It can be <a href="https://thetinypod.com/#buy">ordered from the TinyPod website</a> for &#36;80, with a lite model that does not feature a click wheel available for &#36;30.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/17/tinypod-apple-watch/">TinyPod Turns Your Apple Watch Into an iPod</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tinypod-turns-your-apple-watch-into-an-ipod.2431625/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, Apple added some useful iPad-specific features in the Notes app, including Smart Script and Math Notes. Both of these additions are designed to work with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, and they're some of the neater new features on Apple's tablets. Apple product manager Ty Jordan and engineering manager Jenny Chen recently did an interview with Chris Lawley to discuss the work that went into the &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; updates.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Talking to Apple about Smart Script and Math Notes" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LiAvrlKoEjk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Smart Script is one of the ways that Apple is using machine learning in &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;. It refines handwritten text, making your handwriting look neater without losing the personal flare that makes it <em>your</em> handwriting rather than generic writing. Smart Script learns your handwriting style, which Jordan said makes it as useful as typed text.<br/>
<blockquote>You'll notice that as soon as you start writing words, it refines your handwriting. You'll notice that it spell checks, so if you make a spelling mistake, it'll be underlined. It can also do some really cool things with reflowing your text, so if you tap and hold your Pencil, you can move words around, and you'll see that it reflows in your paragraph so you can get some more space.<br/>
<br/>
You can even paste typed text as your own handwritten text right in the middle of a paragraph, so a lot of things that we take for granted with typed text, you can now do with handwritten text.</blockquote>Smart Script learns continually and while it is designed to work quickly, it will get better over time as you write more, especially for features such as paste as handwriting. Recognition does not persist from note to note, however. Apple wanted the feature to feel personal and not like a font, which is why it refines dynamically with each note. <blockquote>It's very contextual. So, for example, if you were to go to a previous paragraph where you had some band handwriting, we're going to match the handwriting that was refined there and not sort of try to replicate what you've had in other notes.</blockquote><br/>
As for Math Notes, Jordan said that Apple took the time to "really reimagine" the calculator feature could be designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>'s interface. If you're unfamiliar with the feature, Math Notes on &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lets you write out equations with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, with the Notes app solving the equation automatically when an equals sign is added.<br/>
<blockquote>It sort of works like magic. It combines the natural input of a pencil with the amazing on-device machine learning models that Jenny and her teams work on. You just write math like on a piece of paper and like magic, it just gives you the answer. It's so simple and intuitive.</blockquote><br/>
Math Notes is able to recognize variables and the numbers associated with them. So if you define variables like price and area in one part of the note, and then write "price x area," Math Notes is able to provide an answer using the numbers specified earlier. Jordan explains:<br/>
<blockquote>I'll do my best shot and go back to high school. So a variable is just a named value, right? So you probably know a lot of them from school, like X and Y, and you could declare a variable with that [...] but you can do this with any word that you want.<br/>
<br/>
I've personally loved using it for natural experiences, where I might declare like drinks equal something and food equals something else, and then I can just say that plus that and divided by the number of people, and I get an answer. So it just creates this very natural way to work with your math.</blockquote><br/>
Math Notes is intelligent enough to understand the difference between separate variables in a note, so if you have multiple math problems with the same variable like X, it won't get confused. You can have graphs added automatically in Math Notes if an equation can be grafted, which Chen says uses the work that Apple has previously done for the Swift Charts API.<br/>

If you're interested in more context on the new Notes features in &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, the full video is well worth watching. Both Math Notes and Smart Script are available in the &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; beta, which developers and public beta testers can download. The new features will launch in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/17/apple-product-managers-discuss-ipados-18/">Apple Product Managers Discuss Cool New iPadOS 18 Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-product-managers-discuss-cool-new-ipados-18-features.2431616/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
