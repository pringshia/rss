		<description><![CDATA[This week's best Apple-related deals focus on the AirTag 4-Pack, Apple Pencil Pro, and Apple Watch Series 10. You'll also find a few new deals on Anker charging accessories on Amazon below.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>AirTag</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/airtag-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964244" /><br/>
<ul><li><strong>What's the deal?</strong> Take &#36;31 off AirTag 4-pack</li><br/>
<li><strong>Where can I get it?</strong> <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">Amazon</a></li><br/>
<li><strong>Where can I find the original deal?</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/22/apples-airtag-4-pack-69-2/">Right here</a></li></ul><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;31 OFF</div>AirTag 4-Pack for &#36;67.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
When we originally posted a deal on Apple's AirTag 4-Pack earlier this week, it was available for the previous record low price of &#36;69.99. As the week continued, the 4-Pack continued to drop in price, and it's now available for &#36;67.99, down from &#36;99.00. Overall, this is a solid second-best price that's just about &#36;3 higher than the previous low price.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Anker</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With Friday's launch, the iPhone 16e has become the newest member of Apple's iPhone 16 family and the company's latest low-cost iPhone option, though it does come in at a significantly higher price point than the outgoing iPhone SE.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/top-stories-2025-03-01.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992150" /><br/>
Other major Apple news and rumor stories this week included new details on both the iPhone 17 lineup coming later this year and Apple's first foldable iPhone expected in 2026, as well as additional tidbits from the initial iOS 18.4 beta and more, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16e Reviews: Is It Worth &#36;599?</h2><br/>
Following last week's introduction of the new iPhone 16e, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/iphone-16e/">first media reviews landed</a> just ahead of the device's official launch on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-iPhone-16e-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990893" /><br/>
Apple's new cheapest iPhone includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/iphone-16e-battery-capacity/">excellent battery life thanks to a larger battery</a>, Apple's custom C1 modem, and other optimizations, though there are some compromises such as a single rear camera, a lack of MagSafe support, and a lower-spec A18 chip than in the regular iPhone 16.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's 2026 Foldable iPhone Reportedly Has No Visible Display Crease</h2><br/>
Apple is making significant headway on its long-rumored foldable iPhone, with a new report suggesting the company has achieved a major breakthrough by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/apple-2026-foldable-phone-has-no-crease/">effectively eliminating the screen crease</a> that plagues current foldable devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-Fold-Vertical-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988570" /><br/>
Another rumor claims that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/">Apple's foldable iPhone will have a 5.49-inch external display</a> with an inner display that measures 7.74 inches when unfolded, while both displays will have an "unprecedented aspect ratio."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>6 Features Coming to the Apple Watch Ultra 3</h2><br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is expected to launch later this year, arriving two years after the previous model. While no noticeable design changes are expected for the third generation, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/6-apple-watch-ultra-3-features/">there are a series of internal upgrades on the way</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-snow.jpg" alt="" width="2016" height="1061" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862622" /><br/>
Hypertension detection is expected to make its way into the Apple Watch Ultra after many years of development, satellite connectivity is expected to expand from the iPhone to the Apple Watch, brighter displays are likely in the works, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Revealed: Entire iPhone 17 Lineup's Striking New Camera Designs</h2><br/>
We're expecting some significant changes for the iPhone 17 lineup when it launches later this year, particularly with the rear of the devices, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/revealed-entire-iphone-17-lineups-camera-designs/">new set of CAD renderings shows what we may see</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-17-lineup-cad-render-majin-bu.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991423" /><br/>
The renderings are in line with previous rumors about a dual-material back casing for the Pro models with a significantly larger camera bump across the entire top portion of the devices, while the all-new ultra-thin "iPhone 17 Air" will have a similar but smaller camera bump.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.4 Includes a Small But Useful Change for CarPlay</h2><br/>
While the Apple Intelligence-powered Siri overhaul appears to have been pushed back to a later update, the first iOS 18.4 beta does include some new features, and one of the small but welcome ones is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/23/ios-18-4-carplay-change/">nice CarPlay improvement</a> to display more app icons on CarPlay Home in some vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-carplay.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991400" /><em><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-beta-1-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2449908/post-33753569">Image via MacRumors reader JKidwell86</a></em></div><br/>
Other features in the initial iOS 18.4 beta include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/ios-18-4-priority-notifications/">Priority Notifications</a> for Apple Intelligence devices to help identify which of your notifications are likely to be the most important and bring them to the top of your Lock Screen, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/ios-18-4-ambient-music/">new Ambient Music feature</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-news-plus-food-ios-18-4/">Food section for Apple News+ subscribers</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4 and related updates are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/ios-18-4-in-april/">scheduled to be released to the public in early April</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag 2 Rumored to Launch in May or June With These New Features</h2><br/>
We've been hearing for some time about a second-generation AirTag, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/airtag-2-in-may-or-june-rumor/">new rumor claims it could arrive in May or June</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/AirTag-2-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917578" /><br/>
While the claim doesn't include any detail about what to expect in the updated model, previous rumors have pointed to range improvements, a more tamper-resistant speaker to help address stalking concerns, and potentially some sort of special Apple Vision Pro integration.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18.4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/">was supposed to bring</a> new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> features, but Apple ended up needing to pull those capabilities from the update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/apple-intelligence-siri-overhaul-could-get-delayed/">to continue testing</a>. There are fewer new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; additions now, but there are still some new features that will make the update worth installing when it comes out in April.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963902" /><br/>
<h2>Priority Notifications</h2><br/>
Apple introduced Priority Notifications back at the June 2024 WWDC, and it's another &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; feature that we've been waiting on since the September <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> release.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-Intelligence-Priority-Notifications.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991832" /><br/>
With Priority Notifications, Apple analyzes your incoming notifications and highlights the ones that are important, based on context and time. If you've ordered food and your order is approaching, Apple will highlight that notification as a priority, placing it above other notifications. The same goes for anything that has a time-based component, or something else that needs immediate attention.<br/>
<br/>
Priority Notifications is opt-in in the iOS 18.4 beta, so it needs to be turned on by going to Settings > Notifications > Prioritize Notifications.<br/>
<br/>
When turned on, Priority Notifications show up first in your list of notifications on the Lock Screen, in a separate box with an icon that stands out. You can still see all of your other notifications by swiping.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Image Playground</h2><br/>
When the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a> app launched, it only had Animation and Illustration styles to choose from for the images you make, but there were always meant to be three options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-image-playground.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991330" /><br/>
With the iOS 18.4 beta, the third "Sketch" option is available as well. Sketch is a style that looks more like a hand drawn image, and it is distinct from Animation, which is a 3D style, and Illustration, a simpler 3D image.<br/>
<br/>
Apple describes Sketch as a "highly detailed and academic" style that "produces gorgeous drawings on stark backgrounds," while the illustration style features strong outlines, bold colors, and simple shapes. Apple says the animation style has a "whimsical, 3D cartoon look."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Languages</h2><br/>
iOS 18.4 adds &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; support for new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified), plus localized English for Singapore and India.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.4 Release Date</h2><br/>
Apple has seeded one beta of iOS 18.4 to developers and public beta testers so far. A second beta will come next week, and it will be beta tested through the month of March.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to release iOS 18.4 in early April.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Siri Features</h2><br/>
There's a chance that we could still see the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features implemented in a later beta of iOS 18.4, but that's looking unlikely given that there's just a month until the update is set to come out.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, Apple will likely add the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities in an iOS 18.5 update. It is unusual for major new features to come in a .5 update as those updates often come out around the time when Apple transitions focus to a new version of iOS, but it's not unheard of. Apple has been releasing &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; features gradually, and we'll probably see a similar tactic with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>. Rumors already suggest &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; development <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/ios-18-updates-cause-ios-19-delays/">is being pushed back</a> so that Apple can continue to work on &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-features/">These New Apple Intelligence Features Are Coming in iOS 18.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-new-apple-intelligence-features-are-coming-in-ios-18-4.2450420/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with GRID Studio to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 128GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> from Apple. For those unfamiliar with GRID Studio, it is a company that recycles discarded Apple products into art that celebrates Apple's history.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/grid-iphone-2g.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992287" /><br/>
GRID Studio is having a special spring sale on some of its most popular products this week, plus there is a 15 percent off site wide discount available with the promo code SS15. As part of the sale, the <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">GRID iPhone 2G</a>, which features Apple's most iconic <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, is available for &#36;299.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 2G is also known as the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple made back in 2007. GRID's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 2G piece features all of the device's internal components, labeled and artfully arrayed. The iconic original ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌ casing is positioned next to the power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components, and this is before the days where Apple started making its own chips so there are some unique components to see.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-3gs">GRID iPhone 3GS</a> is half off and just &#36;99. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 3GS followed the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 3G, and that "S" was meant to represent speed. It had a processor that was twice as fast as the prior model, and it was Apple's first foray into really focusing on blazing fast performance. The GRID 3GS features the classic pre-iPhone 4 design, and it looks great framed and on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-3gs-white.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992288" /><br/>
You can also <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s">get the GRID 4S</a> for &#36;99, and it features approximately 40 internal components from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S was actually the last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that was introduced in Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' lifetime, and it was the first Apple &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> introduced on stage without Jobs. The "S" stood for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, and it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with Apple's personal assistant.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/grid-iphone-4s.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992289" /><br/>
GRID Studio offers plenty of other iPhones, too, plus iPads. If you have a favorite ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ generation, it's likely that GRID has taken it apart. With each art piece, GRID separates out each of the components and provides labels for the parts.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e reviews</a> are now out, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">Apple's custom-designed C1 modem</a> has been put to the test. The results so far are quite surprising, as the C1's speeds are not as slow compared to Qualcomm modems as originally expected.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-c1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990815" /><br/>
While the C1 does not support ultra-fast mmWave 5G in the U.S., it appears to offer comparable 5G performance to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X71 modem found in the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max.<br/>
 <br/>
First, here is what some reviewers said.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/620155/iphone-16e-review-c1-modem-battery-camera"><em>The Verge</em>'s Allison Johnson</a> did not notice much difference between the C1 and the X71:<blockquote>Much of the 16E is familiar, but there is one entirely new component: Apple’s C1 modem. This is its debut appearance, and the road to Apple's first in-house modem was reportedly full of setbacks and delays. I've used it for the past week to make FaceTime calls, upload large video files in crowded places, and stream YouTube on the bus. I tested it alongside a regular iPhone 16 equipped with a Qualcomm-made modem — both on Verizon — and I didn't see any consistent difference in performance between the two.</blockquote><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/apple-iphone-16e-review#section-apple-iphone-16e-review-battery-and-charging"><em>Tom's Guide</em>'s John Velasco</a></a> didn't seem to notice any major difference either:<blockquote>And finally, you should know that the iPhone 16e is the first device in Apple's portfolio to feature the company's in-house C1 modem. It's a departure from the Qualcomm modem that Apple's relied on for years now, but it's difficult to say if it ultimately delivers faster 5G speeds. I ran speed tests on both the iPhone 16 and 16e at three different locations in New York City, with only one test showing faster speeds with the iPhone 16e.</blockquote>What about actual numbers?<br/>
<br/>
In his iPhone 16e review video, Andru Edwards said the device achieved a peak 5G download speed of 673 Mbps in his suburban New York yard, while connected to the AT&T network. In the same location, he said the iPhone 16 Pro Max achieved up to a 667 Mbps download speed, so the results seem to be roughly equal.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4d3WroBaNuk?si=MElsV-uk3vPX1eYr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
In the middle of New York City, Edwards said his iPhone 16e achieved a download speed of 127 Mbps on AT&T, whereas the iPhone 16 Pro Max clocked in at 75 Mbps on the same network. In that test, the iPhone 16 Pro Max did have a superior upload speed of around 50 Mbps, compared to around 30 Mbps for the iPhone 16e.<br/>
<br/>
In another iPhone 16e review video, shared by Dave Lee of the YouTube channel Dave2D, a speed test shows the device getting around 30 Mbps to 40 Mbps faster 5G download speeds compared to an iPhone 16 Pro Max. Both devices were connected to the Bell network in Toronto, the most populous city in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-WhZT02ubg?si=43nOZOnCnuKmVBp6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
And finally, more scientific testing was shared on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRjsMasGzKA">by the Chinese channel Geekerwan</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The channel tested 5G performance on various smartphones with an artificial 5G network in a lab environment, and the iPhone 16e had comparable 5G speeds and reliability compared to the iPhone 16 and other devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the C1 modem is the most power-efficient iPhone modem ever. More specifically, Apple seems to have told reviewers that the modem is up to 25% more power efficient than Qualcomm modems in other iPhones, and that appears to be an accurate statement. Geekerwan's testing found the iPhone 16e had an average power draw of 0.67W, versus 0.88W for the iPhone 16, which is indeed around a 25% improvement in efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/C1-Modem-5G-Power-Draw.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992273" /><br/>
All in all, these results are surprising compared to reported expectations, and they prove that the C1 modem works just fine in both the real world and lab.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-c1-modem-5g-speed-tests/">How Fast is Apple&#039;s First-Ever 5G Modem?

		<description><![CDATA[Today is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>'s launch day, and Apple has shared a new ad promoting its most affordable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The short spot features an inflatable air dancer holding an &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>

Designed for social media and other quick ad placements, the ad features the song "Talk" from Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco. It's focused on showing off the design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, including the all-display design with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> and the single-lens rear camera.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;599, and while it is more expensive than the prior-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE 3 that it replaces, it features an A18 chip with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support, Apple's super efficient modem, &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, 48-megapixel camera, and a range of other features that make it a solid alternative to the other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-stars-in-apples-latest-ad/">iPhone 16e Stars in Apple&#039;s Latest Ad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-stars-in-apples-latest-ad.2450396/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft today announced that it will officially retire Skype on May 5, 2025, concluding its 14-year tenure as the owner of the once-dominant internet calling and messaging service (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/skype-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-992234" /><br/>
Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for &#36;8.5 billion in what was then its largest-ever acquisition. At its peak, Skype had more than 300 million monthly active users and was synonymous with internet-based voice and video calling. The service steadily declined in relevance in recent years, with its active user base shrinking to approximately 36 million by 2023 as competitors such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and Microsoft's own Teams platform gained traction.<br/>
<br/>
Teams has since grown to 320 million monthly users, far surpassing Skype's remaining user base. The company's decision to discontinue Skype is apparently part of a broader effort to prioritize artificial intelligence features within Teams. Employees currently working on Skype will be reassigned to other projects rather than being laid off.<br/>
<br/>
Skype played a key role in popularizing VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology, enabling businesses and individuals to connect around the world with minimal costs. It also served as an early testbed for AI-powered real-time language translation, a feature Microsoft showcased in a widely publicized demonstration in 2014. However, its frequent UI changes, reliability issues, ill-conceived social media-like features, gradual shift toward enterprise, and inability to keep pace with newer competitors, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately led to its obsolescence.<br/>
<br/>
As Microsoft finalizes the shutdown process, existing Skype users will have until May 5 to migrate their data and contacts to Teams or seek alternative solutions. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/skype/">Skype</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/skype-shutting-down-on-may-5/">Skype Is Finally Shutting Down on May 5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/skype-is-finally-shutting-down-on-may-5.2450379/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new entry-level iPhone 16e has inherited the Action button first seen on the iPhone 15 Pro and now found on all iPhone 16 models. The Action button replaces the traditional Ring/Silent switch – a staple of the iPhone since it launched in 2007. For users unfamiliar with the Action button, here's a rundown of its functions – including one that is (currently) exclusive to iPhone 16e.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-16e-action-button.jpg" alt="" width="1922" height="1081" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990838" /><br/>
The Action button replaces the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent, offering additional options so users can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight, activate Voice Memos, Focus modes, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier. Users can also associate it with Shortcuts for more options. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-how-to-customize-action-button/">How to Customize the Action Button</a></li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-assign-two-shortcuts-action-button/">How to Assign Two Functions to the Action Button</a></li></ul><br/>
A press-and-hold gesture with fine-tuned haptic feedback ensure the new Action button launches the intended action, which you can customize in Settings and assign to different actions. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Action Button Functions</h2><br/>
Here's what the Action button can be programmed to do:<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Access to various accessibility settings, such as VoiceOver, Zoom, AssistiveTouch, Live Speech, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Shortcuts</strong>: Open your favorite app, or run a shortcut created in or downloaded from the Shortcuts app, such as sending a message, playing a playlist, or controlling smart home devices.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Silent Mode</strong>: Like the Ring/Silent switch on existing iPhone models, you can toggle silent mode on or off, which will mute or unmute the ringer and alerts.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Camera</strong>: Take a photo, selfie, video, portrait, or portrait selfie with a single press of the Action button.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Flashlight</strong>: Turn on or off the flashlight on the back of the device.<br/>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Activate or deactivate a Focus mode.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Magnifier</strong>: Activate the Magnifier app to use the iPhone's camera as a magnifying glass to zoom in on small text or objects.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Translate</strong>: Launch the Translate app and start a conversation or text translation with a single press of the Action button.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Voice Memos</strong>: Start or stop recording a voice memo with the Voice Memos app.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Action Button Control Center Options</h2><br/>
In iOS 18, you can assign the Action button to one of the dozens of controls available in the Control Center gallery, allowing the Action button to invoke Dark Mode, Airplane Mode, Personal Hotspot, and more. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Control-Center-Toggles-for-Action-Button-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955224" /><br/>
Available Control Center actions in iOS 18 include:<div style="float: left; width: 50%;"><br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>Calculator</li><br/>
  <li>Stopwatch</li><br/>
  <li>Alarm</li><br/>
  <li>Home</li><br/>
  <li>Timer</li><br/>
  <li>Dark Mode</li><br/>
  <li>Scan Code</li><br/>
  <li>Airplane Mode</li></ul></div><div style="float: right; width: 50%;"><br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>Cellular Data</li><br/>
  <li>Personal Hotspot</li><br/>
  <li>Dark Mode</li><br/>
  <li>Quick Note</li><br/>
  <li>Remote</li><br/>
  <li>Wallet</li><br/>
  <li>Tap to Cash</li><br/>
  <li>Ping My Watch</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Visual Intelligence</strong></li></ul><br/>
</ul></div><br/>
<div style="clear:both;"></div><br/>
The last assignable Action button option in the list, Visual Intelligence, is an Apple Intelligence feature that was previously exclusive to iPhone 16 models with a Camera Control button, which the iPhone 16e does not have. It was thought that the extra button was necessary to activate the feature, but on iPhone 16e, Visual Intelligence can be assigned to the device's Action button or enabled via Control Center.<br/>
<br/>
On iPhone 16 models, Visual Intelligence lets you use the camera to learn more about places and objects around you. It can also summarize text, read text out loud, translate text, search Google for items, ask ChatGPT, and more. Apple has confirmed that Visual Intelligence is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/visual-intelligence-coming-to-iphone-15-pro/">coming to the iPhone 15 Pro</a> in a future software update. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/action-button/">Action Button</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-action-button-everything-it-can-do/">iPhone 16e Has an Action Button: Here&#039;s Everything It Can Do</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-has-an-action-button-heres-everything-it-can-do.2450374/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is collaborating with the National Hockey League (NHL) to equip on-ice officials with Apple Watches featuring an app designed to help officiating during games (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/621004/nhl-watch-comms-apple-watch-wearables-smartwatch"><em>The Verge</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/nhl-apple-watch-16-9.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-992217" /><br/>
The NHL Watch Comms app allows referees to receive in-game updates by syncing with the NHL's Oasis system. Officials can track the game clock and receive alerts for key game events without diverting their focus. This allows referees to avoid locating video boards while officiating. <br/>
<br/>
The app includes haptic feedback to indicate key moments, such as when a player leaves the penalty box or when the period is about to end. Distinct haptic patterns allow referees to differentiate between different notifications without needing to check the screen. The Apple Watches used in NHL games will be league-issued, providing the option of either the Apple Watch Ultra or the Series 10.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2017, the NHL has integrated iPads and Macs into coaching and player workflows, providing teams with real-time access to game footage and analytics. Apple has also worked with other professional sports leagues to bring its wearable technology into competition settings. In 2023, the World Surf League adopted the Apple Watch as its official wearable, using it to deliver real-time scoring, wave priority, and heat times to competitors in the water.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/nhl-to-give-referees-apple-watches/">NHL Collaborating With Apple to Give Referees Apple Watches</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nhl-collaborating-with-apple-to-give-referees-apple-watches.2450372/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube channel REWA Technology today shared an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVW34oJZSy8">iPhone 16e teardown video</a>, providing a look inside Apple's new entry-level smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Internal.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992216" /><br/>
In its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-shares-iphone-16e-announcement-video/">iPhone 16e announcement video</a>, Apple said the device has a new internal design that allowed for a larger battery. The video shows that the iPhone 16e has a 4,005 mAh battery capacity, which is a 12% increase compared to the regular iPhone 16 with a 3,561 mAh battery capacity at the same voltage.<br/>
<br/>
For those who prefer watt-hours as a unit of measurement, the iPhone 16e has a 15.55 Wh battery, while the iPhone 16 has a 13.83 Wh battery.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to being larger, the iPhone 16e battery uses a type of adhesive that can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/18/iphone-16-and-16-plus-9v-battery-removal/">loosened with low-voltage electrical current</a> from a 9V battery, USB-C charger, or another power source. This change debuted on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus last year, and it is rumored to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/10/iphone-17-pro-electrical-battery-removal-rumor/">extend to the iPhone 17 Pro models</a> later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVW34oJZSy8?si=N7knpDzNv7LIoMLa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The teardown also provides a look at the iPhone 16e's logic board, including the A18 chip and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">Apple's custom-designed C1 cellular modem</a>. The video said the A18 chip will be harder to repair because it is apparently more difficult to remove. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, the video showed the iPhone 16e's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-provides-reason-iphone-16e-no-magsafe/">lack of MagSafe magnets</a> for wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
Following pre-orders over the past week, the iPhone 16e began arriving to customers today, and the device is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-available-today-pickup/">now available to purchase in Apple Stores</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/">Teardown</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-teardown/">iPhone 16e Teardown Reveals Larger Battery, C1 Modem, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-teardown-reveals-larger-battery-c1-modem-and-more.2450371/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has offered a reason why the iPhone 16e doesn't include MagSafe, one of the more notable omissions from its latest entry-level smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-16e-usb-c-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1956" height="1100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-992294" /><br/>
According to Apple representatives who spoke to <em><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/the_iphone_16e">Daring Fireball</a></em>'s John Gruber, MagSafe is not included in the iPhone 16e because "most people in the iPhone 16e's target audience exclusively charge their phones by plugging them into a charging cable."<br/>
<br/>
These users apparently tend not to use wireless charging at all, and when they do use it, Apple believes the slower 7.5W Qi charging speed compared to MagSafe's faster rates isn't a deciding factor for the customer segment it is targeting with the more affordable device.<br/>
<br/>
Introduced with the iPhone 12 lineup in 2020, MagSafe uses magnets embedded in the back of compatible iPhones to align wireless chargers and attach accessories. The technology allows for faster wireless charging (up to 15W on most models and 25W on newer Pro models) compared to standard Qi wireless charging, which is limited to 7.5W on iPhones.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-launches-feb-28-new-features/">iPhone 16e Launches Today With These New Features</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple has developed a whole ecosystem of MagSafe accessories including cases, wallets, battery packs, and mounts. The magnetic alignment ensures an optimal charging position and makes attaching accessories more convenient.<br/>
<br/>
When the iPhone 16e was announced, there was some speculation that its new C1 modem might have interfered with MagSafe functionality, but Apple has already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-16e-no-magsafe-unrelated-to-c1/">confirmed</a> that this wasn't the case. Backing up Apple's claim, a prominent iPhone case manufacturer also told <em>MacRumors</em> that its testing confirmed that MagSafe cases don't impact the C1 modem's performance.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 16e continues the trend set by its predecessor, the now-discontinued iPhone SE, which also lacked MagSafe connectivity. However, the 16e is the first iPhone in Apple's flagship smartphone lineup to omit this feature since its introduction. For users who prefer the convenience of MagSafe, some third-party iPhone 16e cases include built-in magnets, but they won't enable faster charging speeds.<br/>
<br/>

Interestingly, <em><a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/834/441.htm">IT Home</a></em> reports that Apple retail stores have had to create a workaround for displaying the iPhone 16e with wireless charging that prevents the device from slipping off its display dock. Apple is using a special docking station that includes a bottom groove that holds the device upright, enabling wireless charging during demonstrations. This custom dock only activates charging when the phone is placed vertically – if you place it horizontally, the iPhone falls off.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to exclude MagSafe from the iPhone 16e may be a cost-cutting measure. But as Gruber notes, "I think Apple knows the 16e's intended audience better than I do," suggesting the company has done its market research on what features matter most to the target buyers of this device.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-accessories/">MagSafe Accessories</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-provides-reason-iphone-16e-no-magsafe/">Apple Provides Reason for iPhone 16e&#039;s Lack of MagSafe</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-provides-reason-for-iphone-16es-lack-of-magsafe.2450353/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expected to embrace a new camera system design for some models in its upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> series, and the latest purported CAD images don't deviate from what we have been hearing lately about Apple's new lineup. If you do not like the sound of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a Google Pixel-style camera bar, look away now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Generic-iPhone-17-Feature-With-Full-Width-Dynamic-Island.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959827" /><br/>
Seasoned leaker <a href="https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1895282858161512882">Sonny Dickson</a> shared the following images in a post on X (Twitter), commenting: "Everyone seems to be sharing the same &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; CAD, so I thought I'd share the ones I've seen."<br/>
<br/>
The first image below is said to show the design of Apple's all-new ultra-thin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, a thinner and lighter device that is expected to replace the Plus model in the lineup. Consistent with rumors and previous CAD images, the render depicts Apple's embrace of an elongated horizontal camera module along the top of the device's rear. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/sonny-dickson-iphone-17-air.jpeg" alt="" width="896" height="428" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992155" /><br/>
With limited internal space due to the slimmed down design, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; is believed to sport a single-lens rear camera. If that's the case, the device will not be capable of capturing spatial video or spatial photos unless Apple has a new technique in mind for capturing this kind of content. Rumors suggest it will use the same 48-megapixel Wide camera that's in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. <br/>
<br/>
At least some &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models will allegedly feature a smoother transition between the edges of the camera bump and the back cover, owing to Apple's use of a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/iphone-17-design-smoother-edge-to-back/">glass-and-metal splicing material process</a>. The concave transition between the bump and the chassis shown in the CAD appears to back this claim.<br/>
<br/>
Moving on, the image below is of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max models. Here is where the alleged redesign is at its most dramatic. Apple's Pro devices are expected to move away from the familiar square camera bump to a distinctive larger aluminum camera bar that spans the device's width. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-17-pro-max-sonny-dickson.jpeg" alt="" width="862" height="445" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992157" /><br/>
The typical triangular triple-lens array maintains its location on the left, but the flash, LiDAR sensor, and rear microphone are shunted over to the right of the extended bump in a vertical alignment. Whether Apple has adopted this design purely for cosmetic or practical reasons – or a mix of form/function – remains unknown.<br/>
<br/>
The last image of the standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; model offers a design most readers will be more accustomed to. Apple appears to be sticking to its tried and tested dual &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; camera system for the base model, which may offer some respite for anyone who can't get behind the new camera bar look. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-17-base-sonny-dickson.jpeg" alt="" width="890" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992161" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/revealed-entire-iphone-17-lineups-camera-designs/">Multiple sources</a> have now backed rumors about the above camera designs in the forthcoming &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; series. The lineup is expected to arrive around Apple's usual mid-September time frame, so it's very late in the game for the rumors to be off.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new entry-level iPhone 16e is now being delivered to customers worldwide following the pre-order period that began on Friday, February 21. For those who didn't pre-order or chose to wait, the devices are currently readily available, and select Apple Store locations globally are offering same-day or next-day pickup options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-iPhone-16e-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990893" /><br/>
As of writing, Apple's online stores in the United States and Canada haven't yet been updated to show pickup availability, but shortages aren't expected and there is unlikely to be much variation state by state. Meanwhile across the pond, all ‌iPhone 16e colors and configurations are available for Apple Store pickup today in many European countries including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Apple Stores in Australia, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea, Türkiye, and the UAE are also offering same-day pickup options.<br/>
<br/>
To order a product with ‌Apple Store‌ pickup, add the product to your bag on Apple.com or in the ‌Apple Store‌ app, proceed to checkout, select the "I'll pick it up" option, enter your ZIP or postal code, choose an available ‌Apple Store‌ location, select a pickup date, and select a 15-minute check-in window. Payment is completed online, and a valid government-issued photo ID and the order number may be required upon pickup.<br/>
<br/>
‌iPhone 16e models are also available for walk-in customers at ‌Apple Store‌ locations with sufficient inventory, but availability can't be guaranteed. Walk-in customers may be placed into a separate queue with lower priority upon arrival to the store.<br/>
<br/>
Starting at &#36;599, the new iPhone 16e is Apple's most affordable smartphone in its flagship lineup. The device succeeds the third-generation iPhone SE, which has now been discontinued.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 16e features a 6.1-inch OLED display, a significant upgrade from the 4.7-inch LCD of the iPhone SE. It also features a notch for Face ID, marking the end of Touch ID on Apple’s iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Powered by the A18 chip, the iPhone 16e supports Apple Intelligence features like notification summaries, Writing Tools, and Genmoji. It also includes a 6-core CPU, 16-core Neural Engine, and a 4-core GPU.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's custom C1 5G modem replaces Qualcomm's and improves power efficiency. As a result, the iPhone 16e boasts the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone, lasting up to 26 hours for video playback – four hours more than the standard iPhone 16.

		<description><![CDATA[Facebook parent company Meta is planning to release a standalone AI app that would compete with products like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot, reports <em><a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/details/714-steve-jobs-and-the-apple-revolution/">CNBC</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>

The upcoming AI app will join Meta's other apps, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Recent news has also suggested that Meta could soon release <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-may-launch-reels-as-separate-app-increasing-pressure-on-tiktok?rc=583sff">a Reels app</a>, breaking out the Instagram feature into its own product.<br/>
<br/>
Meta plans to release a Meta AI app in the second quarter of 2025, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg aiming to become the leader in AI by the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Meta's AI product is already built into apps like Facebook and Instagram as part of the search feature, but it has some of the same generative capabilities as other AI products. Meta believes that a standalone app could allow users to more deeply interact with its AI assistant.<br/>
<br/>
While Meta AI will be free as it is now, Meta will test a paid subscription service that could have more advanced capabilities.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/meta-standalone-ai-app/">Meta to Release Standalone AI App to Compete With ChatGPT</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-to-release-standalone-ai-app-to-compete-with-chatgpt.2450325/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unique Apple products, vintage devices, prototypes, and documents signed by Steve Jobs often fetch thousands of dollars when sold off, and RR Auction is auctioning off a new round <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/details/714-steve-jobs-and-the-apple-revolution/">of rare Apple products</a> as of today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-1-rr-auction.jpg" alt="" width="2164" height="1216" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992136" /><br/>
An operational <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/349991407146000-apple-1-computer-with-original-operation-manual-daniel-kottke-letter-and-accessories-fully-functional/?cat=0">Apple-1 Computer</a> with is up for sale, and could fetch up to &#36;300,000. The machine is known as the "Bayville" Apple-1, and is number 91 on the Apple-1 Registry. The Apple-1 was the first computer sold by Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, and a limited number of the machines remain available.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple-1 is in good condition with clear labeling and no peeling on the board. It comes with an original manual with a handwritten note by Daniel Kottke, who was Apple employees number 12.<br/>
<br/>
There are two checks <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/349550307146001-steve-jobs-signed-1976-apple-computer-co-check-no-5-filled-out-entirely-by-the-companys-co-founder/?cat=0">signed by Steve Jobs</a> that could sell for upwards of &#36;25,000, and a <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/349774107146035-apple-ii-computer-with-early-rev-0-board-in-rare-ventless-case-serial-no-a2s1-0119/?cat=0">rare Apple II Computer</a> with and Rev. 0 logic board and ventless case that could sell for &#36;30,000.<br/>

Several EVT (Engineering Validation Test) prototype devices are up for auction as well, such as <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/349916707146080-apple-macintosh-portable-clear-case-evt-prototype/?cat=0">a Macintosh Portable</a> in a clear case. The Macintosh Portable, released in 1989, was the first battery-powered Apple laptop. Because it weighed more than 16 pounds and was expensive, it wasn't a major success and there are few available, and fewer with a prototype transparent case. Given the rarity of the device, it could sell for &#36;50,000+.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser that was <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to allow users to test features that are planned for future release versions of the Safari browser.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960117" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Safari-Technology-Preview-Updated-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 214 includes fixes and updates for Browser, CSS, JavaScript, Media, Networking, Rendering, Web API, and Web Inspector.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Sonoma and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, the newest version of macOS.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a> from Apple’s website. Complete release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple’s aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while it is designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download and use.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-214/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 214 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-214-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2450321/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

GPT-4.5 is OpenAI's "best model yet" for chat purposes, with scaling in unsupervised learning that allows the model to better recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights.<br/>
<br/>

GPT-4.5 has a more natural feel with an improved personality, and is able to better guide users through ideas and the steps that it takes to get to answers and ideas. It outperforms GPT-4o in almost every category, including everyday queries, professional queries, and creative intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to GPT-4o, GPT-4.5 features a broader knowledge base, an improved ability to follow user intent, and a higher emotional quotient, which OpenAI says makes it useful for writing, programming, and solving practical problems. It could also hallucinate less.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI says that users can expect more warm and intuitive conversations more attuned to human collaboration because it is able to better understand what humans mean and it is better at interpreting subtle cues and implicit expectations.<br/>
<br/>
Note that GPT-4.5 is not a reasoning model like o1 or o3-mini. It is better for general purpose use, and is built using pre-training and post-training. Reasoning models outperform GPT-4.5 at tasks like coding and math.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI is making GPT-4.5 available to Pro users starting today, with access coming to Team and Plus users next week. Education and Enterprise access will follow. Developers on all paid tiers will also get access to GPT-4.5 today.<br/>
<br/>
GPT-4.5 supports file and image uploads and can work on writing and code, but it does not support Voice Mode, video, and screensharing.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/openai-gpt-4-5-model/">OpenAI Debuts New GPT-4.5 Model for ChatGPT</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-debuts-new-gpt-4-5-model-for-chatgpt.2450316/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new beta firmware updates for both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> models and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 with both Lightning and USB-C charging cases. The firmware has a build number of 7E5080a, and it is only available to developers at the current time. This is the second beta firmware update Apple has tested, and the prior version that came out in January had a build number of 7E5067b.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803705" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/AirPods-Pro-Beta-Firmware.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" /><br/>
It is not immediately clear what new features or changes are included in the new firmware, but we'll update this article should we find out. Non-developers continue to have 7B21 firmware on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 and 7B20 firmware on the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj;, with no change until the beta firmware sees an official launch.<br/>
<br/>
Firmware updates <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/airpods-firmware-update-instructions/">can be installed</a> by putting the AirPods in Bluetooth range of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi, and then plugging them in to charge. It can take up to 30 minutes for firmware to update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your firmware version by going to Settings &gt; Bluetooth and selecting the Info button next to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; when they are connected to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or Mac.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware-7e508a/">Apple Releases Beta Firmware Updates for AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-beta-firmware-updates-for-airpods-pro-2-and-airpods-4.2450313/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Copilot is Microsoft's generative AI product, built on OpenAI technology. Copilot is similar to ChatGPT, and users can have questions answered, get coding help, upload images for context, generate images and text, summarize content, conduct research, launch shortcuts, and more.<br/>
<blockquote>Your AI companion is now available on macOS. You can upload images, generate images and text, use the shortcut launcher, dark mode, and try Think Deeper. Microsoft Copilot is the AI companion for everyday life. Talking with Copilot is an easy way to learn, grow and gain confidence, all with the help of OpenAI and Microsoft AI models.</blockquote><br/>
There are no in-app purchases for Microsoft Copilot, but Copilot does have both free and paid tiers. Copilot Pro is priced at &#36;20 per user per month for access to the latest AI models.<br/>
