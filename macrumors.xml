While Sonos has been working to address a number of missing features and issues with the new app and has laid out a timeline to keep users updated on the company's progress, <em>The Verge</em> reports that "discussions high up within Sonos" have centered around potentially offering the old app as an interim solution.<blockquote>Letting customers fall back to the older software could ease their frustrations and reduce at least some of the pressure on Sonos to rectify every issue with the new app. At least for now, the redesigned version is all that’s available, which makes it impossible for some customers to avoid its flaws.</blockquote>Just last week, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/sonos-delays-product-launces-to-fix-app/">revealed on the company's earnings call</a> that it will be delaying two upcoming product launches due to "challenges with our new app." While Spence did not identify the products in question, one of them is likely to be the successor to the company's flagship Arc soundbar.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/sonos-bring-back-old-app/">Sonos Considering Bringing Back Its Old Mobile App Amid Ongoing Issues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-considering-bringing-back-its-old-mobile-app-amid-ongoing-issues.2433647/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is moving forward with its project to develop a tabletop robotic device, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-14/apple-pushes-ahead-with-tabletop-home-device-in-shift-to-robotics">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" /><em>MacRumors rendering of a similar device based on the G4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></em></div><br/>
The device would feature a large iPad-like display mounted on a "thin robotic arm" that would allow the display to tilt and up and down and rotate a full 360º, and it would serve as a "smart home command center," a videoconferencing machine such as for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls, and a home security monitoring tool.<br/>
<br/>
The tabletop robot would leverage <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Apple Intelligence, allowing it to respond to an array of verbal commands, recognize different voices, and automatically orient the display to face users in the room. <br/>
<br/>
While Apple has been toying with the idea for some time, Gurman says Apple has recently prioritized development of the device, putting it under the purview of Kevin Lynch, Apple's vice president of technology who has overseen such projects as the Apple Watch and Apple's defunct self-driving car venture.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is now looking to launch the device as soon as 2026 or 2027 and is aiming to get the price down to around &#36;1,000, though plans may change as development proceeds.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/">Apple Aiming to Launch Tabletop Robotic Home Device as Soon as 2026 With Pricing Around &#36;1,000</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-aiming-to-launch-tabletop-robotic-home-device-as-soon-as-2026-with-pricing-around-1-000.2433643/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has the Apple Studio Display for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,299.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.00, which is a match of the all-time low price on the monitor. This is the standard glass version of the Studio Display with the tilt adjustable stand, and Amazon also has a few other models on sale as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-studio-display-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839183" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the standard glass model with the VESA Mount Adapter for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HGN6Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,299.99</strong></a>, while the tilt- and height-adjustable stand model is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HMZW5%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,599.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,999.00. Both of these are record low prices on the display.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;299 OFF</div>Standard Glass Apple Studio Display for &#36;1,299.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you want to upgrade to the nano-texture glass option, Amazon also has this model of the Studio Display on sale. It's available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HP4KL%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,599.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,899.00, which is a second-best price on the Studio Display with nano-texture glass.<br/>
<br/>
The Studio Display features a 27-inch 5K retina display with a 5120 x 2880 resolution and up to 600 nits of brightness. Apple says that the standard display is engineered for "extremely low reflectivity," but for rooms where there is a lot of glare, Apple suggests the nano-texture glass option with even less reflectivity.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Award-winning iPhone camera app <a href="https://halide.cam">Halide</a> was today updated to version 2.15, which includes a new feature that allows users to take photos devoid of all image processing for a more natural look.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/halide-process-zero-update.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961650" /><br/>
Halide's new image processing pipeline is called "<a href="http://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/">Process Zero</a>," which uses "zero AI, no computational photography whatsoever – offering photographers a counter to the increasingly AI-heavy processing and tooling on smartphones," according to app developer Lux Optics. <br/>
<br/>
Process Zero uses a fast process based on a single exposure RAW file. The file itself is a 12 megapixel image plus a RAW DNG file for additional editing. <br/>
<br/>
"Process Zero is fast, capturing at anywhere from 10 — 25× the speed of a ProRAW capture. Much like film, it can feature natural sensor grain, slight color aberrations, and is much less usable in low light. This makes for its natural look, like taking photos on an older classic digital camera," explain the developers.<br/>
<br/>
Halide 2.15 still allows photographers the choice of process before or during shooting – users can choose processing at setup, or while shooting, picking from ProRAW, standard iPhone photo processing, reduced image processing, or Process Zero. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, the Halide update includes a dial in the app's new Image Lab which lets users re-develop the RAW file with Process Zero for different exposure levels. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/halide-Process-Choice.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1173" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961653" /><br/>
Lux Optics is eager to stress that many of Apple's image processing features still benefit users, but with Process Zero they can see exactly what images look like when it's completely taken away.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/halide-mark-ii-by-lux-camera/id885697368">Halide 2.15</a> is available today from the App Store with a limited 1-week discount on all new Halide memberships for &#36;11.99 per year (usual price is &#36;19.99). There is also a 1-week free trial with a membership, or users can opt for a lifetime purchase of &#36;59.99.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/halide/">Halide</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/halide-2-15-lets-users-take-shots-with-zero-computational-processing/">Halide 2.15 Lets Users Take Shots With Zero Computational Processing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/halide-2-15-lets-users-take-shots-with-zero-computational-processing.2433637/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/developers-can-soon-offer-in-app-nfc-transactions-using-the-secure-element/">announced</a> that developers will soon be able to offer NFC transactions in their own apps for the first time – something that is mostly exclusive to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> at present.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Apple-Tap-to-Pay-on-iPhone-avail-UK-transaction.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1306" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903160" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 18.1 later this year, developers will be able to offer in-app contactless transactions, separate from &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; and Apple Wallet, using new APIs. This opens up new possibilities for in-store payments, car keys, closed-loop transit, corporate badges, student IDs, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty and rewards cards, and event tickets, as well as government IDs in the future. The APIs use the Secure Enclave inside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, a certified chip that stores sensitive information directly on the device itself.<br/>
<br/>
Users will be able to use an app that features these APIs either by opening the app directly or setting it as their default contactless app in Settings to double-click the Side button and initiate the transaction.<br/>
<br/>
Developers will need to request the NFC and Secure Enclave entitlement, enter into a commercial agreement with Apple, and pay the associated fees. Apple says this ensures that only authorized developers who meet certain regulatory and industry requirements and commit to Apple's security and privacy standards can gain access to the APIs.<br/>
<br/>
The NFC and Secure Enclave APIs will be available to developers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the UK, and the U.S. in an upcoming developer seed for iOS 18.1, with more regions to follow.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/">NFC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-opening-up-iphones-nfc-chip-to-developers/">Apple Opening Up iPhone&#039;s NFC Chip to Third-Party Developers in iOS 18.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-opening-up-iphones-nfc-chip-to-third-party-developers-in-ios-18-1.2433629/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, currently in beta, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> apps have both Light and Dark color options, making it possible to match the color of your icons when you have Dark mode enabled. Keep reading to learn how it works.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-dark-mode-icons.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956931" /><br/>
Apple's built-in apps have both Light and Dark color options in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, and third-party apps will likely provide their own Light and Dark icon alternatives to match your preferred aesthetic when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is released to the public, but until then your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will happily generate dark versions of them, too.<br/>
<br/>
The Dark icons are all redesigned with a black background rather than a white or colored background, which makes them blend in better with the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a>‌ setting. In addition, it's possible to turn on Dark icons independently of having ‌&zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj;‌ enabled, so you can leave Light mode on while using the Dark icon option if you prefer.<br/>
<br/>
To go along with the ‌&zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj;‌ icons, Apple also introduced a toggle that makes your wallpaper darker. The following steps explain how to switch your icon colors to match Light or Dark mode.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Press and hold a space on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or an app page to enter jiggle mode.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the top-left corner.</li><br/>
  <li>Select <strong>Customize</strong> in the dropdown menu.</li><br/>
  <li>Choose <strong>Dark</strong>, <strong>Light</strong>, or <strong>Automatic</strong> in the customization panel. (Automatic will lighten or darken the icons depending on whether Light or Dark mode is enabled.)</li><br/>
<li>Tap anywhere outside the customization panel to close it and exit jiggle mode.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/change-dark-mode-icons.jpg" alt="" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961676" /><br/>
<br/>
Note that the customization panel has other new settings including one to darken your wallpaper (the sun icon), an option to make icons bigger or smaller, and a Tint option that will put a tint over all of your icons (you can even match the tint with a color from your wallpaper using an eyedropper icon).  <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-make-home-screen-icons-dark/">iOS 18: Make Your iPhone Home Screen Icons Dark</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-make-your-iphone-home-screen-icons-dark.2433627/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a new ad titled "The Relay" focused on athletic accessibility with the tagline "designed for every body."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BPqir3EZolw?si=dVNBIQenl33gev8e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Shared ahead of the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris, the ad shows some of the routines, training, and competitions undertaken by disabled athletes across a wide range of sports, assisted by Apple devices. It emphasizes inclusivity and the universality of competitive sport, regardless of one's physical disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Apple products are designed for every body. Whether you're a sprinter, wheelchair racer, track cyclist, or swimmer, features like the Workout app on Apple Watch, sleep metrics, and daily exercise goals — along with the ability to record and analyze your performance on iPad and Mac — ensure that all athletes have what they need to train and compete at their best.<br/>
<br/>
And innovative accessibility features like Point and Speak on iPhone, for users with low vision, or AssistiveTouch (which helps those with upper-limb difference use Apple Watch one-handed) further equip adaptive athletes with the ability to excel equally.</blockquote><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify says it has received approval from Apple to display pricing information in its iOS app for users in the European Union, following its years-long legal struggle with the company.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-vs-Spotify-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801789" /><br/>
Spotify says that from Wednesday, iPhone users in the EU will be informed of pricing information in the app and the fact that they can go to the company's website to purchase items directly. <br/>
<br/>
"EU iPhone consumers will now benefit from seeing our end of summer promotional pricing," said Spotify in an <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-04/the-european-commission-confirms-apples-anti-competitive-behavior-is-illegal-and-harms-consumers/">updated blog post</a>. "They'll also finally be able to see how much a Premium plan of their choosing costs once the promotion ends."<br/>
<br/>
The music streamer is not opting into Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/app-store-external-links-european-union/">complicated new business rules</a> under the Digital Markets Act, but is instead taking advantage of Apple's "entitlement" for music streaming services – a result of the European Commission's decision on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">March 4</a> which found that Apple violated the EU's antitrust laws and fined them over €1.8 billion. <br/>
<br/>
Spotify is still not giving users a link to click to make purchases from outside of the App Store, which it could have done under the entitlement terms, but it presumably does not want to give Apple a cut of any off-platform sales, which Apple would likely argue is a reflection of the value the App Store provides.<br/>
<blockquote>"Unfortunately, Spotify and all music streaming services in the EU are still not able to freely give consumers a simple opportunity to click a link to purchase in app because of the illegal and predatory taxes Apple continues to demand, despite the Commission's ruling.<br/>
<br/>
"The fight continues. iPhone consumers everywhere deserve basic information about how much things cost, when they can take advantage of great deals and promotions, and where to go to buy those things online. If the European Commission properly enforces its decision, iPhone consumers could see even more wins, like lower cost payment options and better product experiences in the app."</blockquote>Spotify has been in a legal spat with Apple in the EU <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/">since 2019</a>, when it filed an antitrust complaint over App Store rules. As recently as March Spotify <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/spotify-no-apple-approval-subscription-update/">complained</a> to the Commission that Apple was failing to approve a Spotify update that adds information on subscription pricing and links its website.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-allows-spotify-show-pricing-eu-app/">Apple Allows Spotify to Show Pricing Info to EU Users in iPhone App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-allows-spotify-to-show-pricing-info-to-eu-users-in-iphone-app.2433612/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is still working on a larger iMac with over a 30-inch display, but the development stage and potential release schedule for the all-in-one computer still remains largely unknown.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
Following the launch of the Mac Studio and 27-inch Studio Display in March 2022, Apple discontinued the Intel-based 27-inch iMac. The company had already consigned the iMac Pro to its discontinued products list the previous March. Then in November 2023, Apple dashed hopes of a future 27-inch iMac when it confirmed to several publications that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">no plans to release such a machine</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Despite Apple's product reshuffle and its continued attempt to push customers to buy its 24-inch iMac or opt instead for a Mac Studio / Studio Display combo, there have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/imac-with-over-30-inch-display/">persistent rumors of a larger-screened iMac</a> in the works that has a display that's over 30 inches in size. The machine was said to be in the early stages of development in mid-2023, but until recently the rumor mill had gone all but quiet about its progress.<br/>
<br/>
Now, <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman has offered a ray of hope for fans of a larger model. "A larger iMac remains something Apple is exploring," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">latest weekly report</a>. However, Gurman still says it is unclear if the device will use Apple's latest M4 processor. Apple plans to update its 24-inch iMac to an M4 processor later this year, but Gurman's comments suggest that this could be too early for the larger model, given its current development phase. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/09/m4-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac-2024/">M4 MacBook Pro, iMac, and Redesigned Mac Mini Coming This Year</a></li></ul><br/>
Gurman in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/imac-with-over-30-inch-display/">June 2023</a> reported that Apple was in the early stages of developing a new iMac with over a 30-inch display, and that it was "further out," suggesting that it might be at least a year or two away from launching. Then in October 2023, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expected a 32-inch iMac with a mini-LED display to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">come out in 2025</a>. Kuo did not specify, but such a machine could be positioned as an "‌iMac‌ Pro" to replace the 2017 model that Apple discontinued in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/iMac-Pro-Mock-Graphic-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-877852" /><br/>
So it seems Apple could still release a larger M4 iMac in 2025, alongside planned processor upgrades the MacBook Air, Mac Pro, and Mac Studio next year. Another possibility is that Apple will hold out for its M5 chip, which could see the bigger iMac arrive in 2026 or later. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/09/when-to-expect-m4-macbook-air-mac-studio-mac-pro/">When to Expect New M4 MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro Models</a></li></ul><br/>
As the rumors indicate, the actual size of the bigger iMac that Apple is working on is still unclear, but the display is surely going to be over 30 inches. At 32 inches, it would offer the same dimensions as the 6K Pro Display XDR, which Apple sells for &#36;5,000. As for the design, we could perhaps see slimmer bezels and a machine that is ultimately modeled after the Studio Display, with Apple eliminating the chin, but rumors are not clear on this point.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-still-working-on-larger-imac/">Apple Still Developing Bigger iMac With Over 30-Inch Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-developing-bigger-imac-with-over-30-inch-display.2433611/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Multiple rumors have suggested that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models are going to have an all-new button that's designed to make it easier to capture photos when the devices are held in landscape mode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Right-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928697" /><br/>
Apple calls the button the Capture Button internally, and it is going to be one of the most advanced buttons that's been introduced to date with support for multiple gestures and the ability to respond to pressure. Here's everything the button will be able to do, according to rumors:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Lightly press on the button to autofocus while capturing an image or video.</li><br/>
 	<li>Press harder on the button to take a photo.</li><br/>
 	<li>Swipe left and right on the button to zoom in and out.</li><br/>
 	<li>There may also be a gesture for switching between photo mode and video mode, similar to how you can capture a video with a press and swipe in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> camera app.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The ability to autofocus with a light press on the button will be a gesture that DSLR camera owners are used to, as this is often how you autofocus when using a high-end camera.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to put the button on the right side of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, in the space where the mmWave antenna is on iPhones that are sold in the United States. The mmWave antenna will be moving to the left side of the device to make space.<br/>
<br/>
The Capture Button has been depicted in CAD renders and dummy models of all four &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; devices, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">this week suggested</a> that there is a possibility that it will only be available on the Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
With the Capture Button, Apple will be able to encourage users to take images and videos captured in landscape orientation, which are better viewed on the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
Along with a Capture Button, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will feature slightly bigger displays, a new A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence, and 8GB RAM for all models, which is necessary to power Apple's AI models.

		<description><![CDATA[When introducing the new Pixel 9 models today, Google didn't miss an opportunity to denigrate Apple Intelligence. All of the new Pixel 9 devices are integrated with Google's AI technology, Gemini, and there are a host of new AI features that Google introduced.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixZAvDCysNw" title="Your personal AI assistant | Gemini" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Like Apple Intelligence, Gemini works using on-device processing power, but Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-9-new-ai-features/#pixel9phones">made sure to point out</a> that Gemini is capable enough to answer complex queries without handing a task off to another AI service. The comment was a dig at Apple's plan to add ChatGPT integration to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, as ChatGPT will be able to do things that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can't. From Google:<br/>
<blockquote>Gemini is deeply integrated with Google apps and Android and can handle complex queries without hand-off to third-party AI providers you may not know or trust.</blockquote><br/>
Apple will use ChatGPT for things like generating text from scratch, something that Apple Intelligence doesn't do. Apple did add Writing Tools, but it is limited to rewriting content that you've already written to change the tone or style. ChatGPT will also be able to generate images that Image Playground cannot, such as photorealistic content, and it will handle requests like generating meal recipes.<br/>
<br/>
When a user asks &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; something that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; cannot handle, the personal assistant will ask for permission to hand it over to ChatGPT. ChatGPT integration is entirely optional, and OpenAI is partnering with Apple to bring it to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users for free.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple also plans to add Gemini integration to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, allowing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to choose their preferred AI service. It's not quite clear if Apple Intelligence is incapable of handling full text generation and photorealistic image creation, or if these are capabilities that Apple feels are a little too questionable to touch given the sentiment about AI-created content.<br/>
<br/>
Google's new Pixel devices have several interesting AI features, including Pixel Studio, a new image generator that uses an on-device diffusion model. It will generate stickers and images using text prompts, similar to Image Playground.<br/>
<br/>
AI will be able to edit photos to add objects that weren't originally in the image, plus Google plans to use it for custom weather reports. The camera app has an option to merge two photos together so that the person taking a group photo can be in the picture, and it can catalog and remember information from screenshots. There's also a feature called Call Notes, which mimics Apple's call recording feature by recording and summarizing phone calls.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the latest betas of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple added new functionality to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, the feature that lets you control your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from your Mac. When &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring first debuted in the betas, there was no support for managing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, but that's now changed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iphone-mirroring-jiggle-mode.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961621" /><br/>
Apple added an option to get into jiggle mode, as noted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/13/iphone-mirroring-jiggle-mode-ios-18-mac/">9to5Mac</a></em>. After activating the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring app, you can click and hold on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; to activate jiggle mode. In this mode, you can do everything you can in jiggle mode on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; itself, from deleting and rearranging apps to managing widgets.<br/>
<br/>
You can add widgets, change widget sizes, activate app long press functionality, turn on dark mode icons, or opt into icon tinting. There is no option to get to the Lock Screen or Control Center, though, and notifications can only be viewed through the Mac notification center.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added the new jiggle functionality in the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, iOS 18.1, macOS 15, and macOS 15.1 betas, so if you have any of the developer or public betas, you should be able to use the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring functionality as of now.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/iphone-mirroring-jiggle-mode/">iPhone Mirroring in macOS Sequoia and iOS 18 Now Supports Jiggle Mode for Managing Home Screen</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-mirroring-in-macos-sequoia-and-ios-18-now-supports-jiggle-mode-for-managing-home-screen.2433583/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today announced the launch of several new smartphones in its Pixel lineup, including the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, all of which have new Gemini-powered AI capabilities. There's also a new Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/pixel-9-devices.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961597" /><br/>
Google is offering two sizes of its Pro model for the first time, with the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL available in 6.3-inch and 6.8-inch sizes, respectively. The standard Pixel 9 has a 6.3-inch display, while the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a 6.3-inch cover display that unfolds into an 8-inch display.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MsAPm8TCFhU" title="Meet Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro With Gemini | The Best of Google AI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The Pixel 9 models have a redesigned rear camera bar that's centered at the back of the device. Other design details include a matte glass back and polished metal sides, and Google says the new devices are twice as durable as the Pixel 8 smartphones. The Fold has a thinner chassis, a fluid-friction hinge, and a rectangular camera setup on one half of the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/pixel-9-pro-fold.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961598" /><br/>
Google is using new OLED displays that it calls "Super Actua" for the Pro, Pro XL, and Fold, and all three are brighter than prior-generation models. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is 80 percent brighter than the Pixel Fold. Google is also using Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/phx5I9Fqh38" title="Meet Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold With Gemini | An Epic Display of Google AI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The new Pixel smartphones are equipped with the Google Tensor G4, which Google says was custom built for AI like Gemini. It is faster and more power efficient than Google's prior processor, with Google also adding more RAM (12GB for the Pixel, 16GB for the Pixel Pro models). There are also improvements to battery life and camera technology across the board, with the Pixel 9 Pro models adopting a 5x telephoto lens with 20x Super Res Zoom.<br/>
<br/>
Gemini is the AI assistant on the Pixel smartphones, and it is "deeply integrated" into Google apps with support for Gemini Live on the Pro models. Gemini Live requires a Gemini Advanced subscription and offers a "mobile conversational experience" for "free-flowing conversations" with the AI. Pixel users can communicate with Gemini using text, images, or voice. Pixel Studio is a new app that features an on-device image generator that creates stickers and images using text-based prompts.<br/>
<br/>
There are several photographic capabilities available, such as Add Me, a feature that uses augmented reality and AI to add the photographer into the shot by combining multiple images together. Auto frame allows images to be reframed for better composition, Zoom Enhance fills in missing pixels so you can zoom in further after taking a shot, and the Magic Editor supports editing photos with text prompts. Google says you can do things like adding wildflowers to an open field.<br/>
<br/>
Google is using AI to supplement the weather app for custom weather reports, create lists in Google Keep, summarize emails and messages, and save, recall, and organize information from screenshots. Call Notes is an option that saves a private summary of a conversation after a phone call. Satellite SOS, a feature that has been available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> since 2022, is now available on the Pixel 9 smartphones.<br/>
<br/>
The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are lighter and smaller than the Pixel Buds Pro, and Google is using AI and a faster Tensor A1 chip to improve Active Noise Cancellation. Gemini integration is built in, including the Gemini Live feature for conversing with Gemini AI. Other features include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> Device integration, Clear Calling for cutting down on ambient noise, and Conversation Detection for disabling ANC when someone speaks.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gaUbj8K3RkI" title="Meet Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 | Light Ears Ahead" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The Pixel Watch 3 with circular design comes in two sizes, including 41mm and a new larger 45mm option, with smaller bezels for larger display sizes. Both are more power efficient thanks to new display technology that's also brighter than before.<br/>
<br/>
The watch has a new health feature that is able to detect if a person loses pulse, placing a call to emergency services for assistance. It is also able to automatically detect sleep and enter Bedtime mode to conserve battery, and it can last for up to 36 hours. Other features include Daily Readiness, Cardio Load, and Target Load, which are similar to capabilities Apple is introducing with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a> to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to give the new features a try ahead of when the software launches this fall. The fourth beta comes two weeks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-seeds-watchos-11-public-beta-3/">after the third beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957264" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchos-11-vitals.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; can be downloaded after signing up on <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">Apple's beta software website</a> and upgrading your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to the public beta version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. You'll need to open up the Watch app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, go to General, select Software Update, and choose the &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; Public Beta option under Beta Updates.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj;, Apple added a new Vitals app that can be used to give you a daily overview of your health metrics, letting you know if anything is out of the ordinary. It compares information collected at night like heart rate, sleep, respiratory rate, and oxygen level to your levels over the previous weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Smart Stack has new widgets like Translate and Shazam, plus it's smarter because it is able to suggest widgets based on time, date, location, and daily routine. Interactive widgets let you access app features from the Smart Stack, and it also supports Live Activities.<br/>
<br/>
Training Load is a new way of measuring how the intensity and duration of workouts impact the body over time, with Apple providing an effort level for cardio-based workouts to help you know when to rest and when to push harder.<br/>
<br/>
You can now customize your Activity Ring requirements for different days of the week, and Apple added support for rest days. Taking a break from activity will no longer ruin a streak because you can pause for a day, a week, a month, or more.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include more workout types, Check In for Messages, a revamped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> watch face, improvements to Double Tap, and more, with additional information <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">available in our watchOS 11 roundup</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[India's Competition Commission has recalled two investigative reports accusing Apple of antitrust violations after the company raised concerns about the disclosure of confidential commercial information (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/india-orders-unusual-recall-reports-apple-antitrust-probe-2024-08-13/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/apple-india.jpg" alt="" width="2304" height="1296" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-756076" /><br/>
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has withdrawn two key reports that alleged Apple breached local competition laws. The recall, which is highly unusual, comes after the company filed a complaint claiming that the reports contained sensitive commercial data that was improperly disclosed to its competitors, including Tinder-owner Match Group. The commission has not publicly detailed the exact nature of the confidential information in question, but it is believed to primarily concern financial data related to Apple's operations in India.<br/>
<br/>
The reports were part of a prolonged investigation into Apple's practices in the Indian market, focusing on allegations that the company abused its dominant position in the app store market to force developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system. The system, which charges commissions of up to 30%, has been a subject of scrutiny around the world, with regulators in Europe, Japan, South Korea, and the United States raising similar concerns about its impact on competition and market fairness.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's defense in the case centers on its argument that it is a minor presence in India, where only 3.5% of the country's 690 million smartphones are iPhones, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Despite this relatively small market share, the CCI's initial findings suggested that Apple had exploited its position to the detriment of app developers, users, and other payment processors.<br/>
<br/>
The recall is expected to delay the investigation by several months as the CCI undertakes the process of redacting the sensitive information and potentially reissuing revised reports. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/apple-halts-indian-antitrust-probe-with-complaint/">Apple Halts Indian Antitrust Probe With Confidentiality Complaint</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-halts-indian-antitrust-probe-with-confidentiality-complaint.2433559/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> with spatial audio is now available in Rivian electric vehicles as part of the company's Connect+ subscription.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/rivian-apple-music.jpg" alt="" width="1020" height="574" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961570" /><br/>
Rivian's latest software update brings a unique, built-in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app to the company's electric vehicles, such as the R1T truck and R1S SUV. The &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app allows users to access a library of over 100 million songs, 30,000 curated playlists, and global live-streaming radio stations as part of a fully-integrated experience in Rivian's infotainment system.<br/>
<br/>
Rivian's Connect+ subscription is required to access streaming services like &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and Spotify. The subscription is priced at &#36;14.99 per month or &#36;149.99 annually and enables other features such as Wi-Fi hotspot capabilities, satellite imagery, and enhanced voice commands via Alexa. <br/>
<br/>
Vehicles equipped with Rivian's Premium Audio system, which includes an 18-speaker, 960-watt surround sound setup, can also play Dolby Atmos &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; songs with spatial audio, enabling music to be experienced in a more three-dimensional space in the vehicle. Rivian is offering a two-month free trial of Connect+ starting today.<br/>
<br/>
Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/rivian-explains-why-no-apple-carplay/">recently explained</a> that the company has no plans to introduce support for Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> in its vehicles, remarking that "we just believe that it is such an important piece of real estate, the digital ecosystem, that it was something we want to retain" and "we have taken the view of the digital experience in the vehicle wants to feel consistent and holistically harmonious across every touchpoint."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dolby-atmos/">Dolby Atmos</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rivian/">Rivian</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/apple-music-now-available-in-rivian/">Apple Music With Spatial Audio Now Available in Rivian Vehicles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-with-spatial-audio-now-available-in-rivian-vehicles.2433554/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Next year's iPhone SE 4 will almost certainly come with 8GB of RAM, up from 4GB in the 2022 model, due to the hardware requirements of Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
Currently in Apple's smartphone lineup, only the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/does-my-iphone-support-apple-intelligence/">iPhone 15 Pro models support Apple Intelligence</a>, Apple's suite of AI features coming in iOS 18.1, because the features require a minimum of 8GB of RAM. There is only 6GB RAM in the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, so they will miss out. <br/>
<br/>
Following the release of the iPhone 16 lineup in September, Apple will release the fourth-generation iPhone SE as early as the beginning of 2025, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495"><em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman</a>, and he says "you can bet that it will have Apple Intelligence." <br/>

So unless Apple discontinues the iPhone 15 models this year when the iPhone 16 series debuts, this will leave Apple's smartphone lineup in an unusual position, with a sub-&#36;500 device in the iPhone SE 4 able to run Apple's latest AI features while the standard iPhone 15 models cannot.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature an iPhone 14-like design, Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, an Action button, an Apple-designed 5G modem, an A18 processor, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. The device's display is expected to grow in size from 4.7 inches to 6.06 inches and use OLED for the first time.<br/>

Apple suppliers are expected to begin ramping up mass production of the device in October of this year. The device could be released ahead of the Lunar New Year in January 2025. However, all three existing iPhone SE models were announced in March over the years, so a March 2025 release seems quite possible too.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/iphone-se-4-8gb-ram-apple-intelligence/">iPhone SE 4 Likely to Feature 8GB of RAM for Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-likely-to-feature-8gb-of-ram-for-apple-intelligence.2433542/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
