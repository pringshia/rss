		<description><![CDATA[A legal claim in the United Kingdom over Apple's 2017 "throttling" controversy has been allowed to move forward by the Competition Appeal Tribunal, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/mass-lawsuit-against-apple-over-iphone-batteries-can-go-ahead-london-tribunal-2023-11-01/">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-slow-16x9-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1314" height="740" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920127" /><br/>
Consumer advocate Justin Gutmann <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/16/uk-legal-claim-25-million-users-battery-throttling/">filed the claim back in June 2022,</a> originally seeking a total of £750 million for up to 25 million <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the UK whose devices were affected by the issue, which stemmed from Apple's efforts to prevent devices with degraded batteries from unexpectedly shutting down while in use. The claim has since ballooned to as much at £1.6 billion plus interest.<blockquote>Gutmann's lawyers had argued Apple concealed issues with batteries in certain phone models and "surreptitiously" installed a power management tool which limited performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple, however, said the lawsuit is "baseless" and that it strongly denies batteries in iPhones were defective, apart from in a small number of iPhone 6s models for which it offered free battery replacements.</blockquote>Gutmann's claim covers &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 through &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X models, and while the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled the claim can move forward, it also highlighted "a lack of clarity and specificity" that will need to be resolved before it can actually proceed to trial.<br/>
<br/>
Apple deployed power management features with iOS 10.2.1 in 2017 that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/">throttled performance</a> to prevent devices with degraded batteries from attempting to draw peak power the batteries could no longer provide. Apple says it introduced the features to help extend device lifespan while minimizing disruptive device shutdowns, but the company was criticized by some customers for not disclosing what it was doing amid suggestions it was attempting to hide defective devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/">apologized</a> for not better explaining the changes it made and why it did so, and introduced a low-cost battery replacement program that lasted for several years.<br/>
<br/>
In 2020, Apple agreed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/02/apple-agrees-to-up-to-500m-batterygate-settlement/">pay up to &#36;500 million</a> to settle a long-running class action lawsuit in the United States over the issue, and the company has faced similar lawsuits in a number of other countries.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/">iPhone Slowdown</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/uk-lawsuit-throttled-iphones-moves-forward/">UK Lawsuit Over &#039;Throttled&#039; iPhones Moves Forward</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-lawsuit-over-throttled-iphones-moves-forward.2409517/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>First Benchmark Results Surface for M3 Chip in New Macs</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The first benchmark results for the standard M3 chip surfaced <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=mac15%2C3">in the Geekbench 6 database</a> today, providing a closer look at the chip's CPU performance improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
Based on the results so far, the M3 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 3,000 and 11,700, respectively. The standard M2 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 2,600 and 9,700, respectively, so the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip, as Apple claimed during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">"Scary Fast" event</a> on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear if the results are for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro or iMac, both of which are available with the standard M3 chip, but performance should be similar for both machines. The results have a "Mac15,3" identifier, which <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-14/apple-ramps-up-testing-of-new-macbooks-ahead-of-summer-launch">reported</a> was for a laptop with the same display resolution as a 14-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The standard M3 chip is equipped with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, and it supports up to 24GB of unified memory. The chip has improved GPU architecture with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, which will make high-end games look more realistic. It also has a 16-core Neural Engine for AI.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has refreshed the MacBook Pro's hardware with a full set of M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, but what exactly do the latest machines bring to the table and is it worth upgrading from the previous generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/MacBook-Pro-2021-2023-and-2023-Buyers-Guide-Feature-1.875.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920052" /><br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip starts at &#36;1,599, replacing the previous <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> 13-inch model as the entry-level machine in Apple's pro notebook lineup. Equipped with the higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, the 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,999 and the 16-inch model starts at &#36;2,499.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the launch of the latest models, previous-generation MacBook Pro models have been discontinued and are no longer available from Apple's main storefront. Units of slightly older machines such as the 2021 and early 2023 models may, however, still be available via Apple's refurbished store and third-party retailers for significantly reduced prices. Buying a 2021 or early 2023 model second-hand is also an option.<br/>
<br/>
First-time MacBook Pro‌ customers or those upgrading from a much older device may be wondering whether it is worth buying a 2021 or early 2023 model, so it will be important to weigh up exactly what was added with the latest version. Likewise, existing users of the 2021 or early 2023 MacBook Pro may be wondering if it is worth upgrading to the latest model or sticking with their current device.<br/>
<br/>
See the detailed breakdown below for each new feature, change, and improvement that was added with the late 2023's ‌14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models compared to their predecessors:<br/>

The late 2023 MacBook Pro models are relatively minor improvements over their direct predecessors that primarily focus on performance improvements. Beyond their chips, the early 2023 MacBook Pro introduced support for Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1, and added an extra hour of battery life. The late 2023 MacBook Pro added an extra 100 nits of SDR brightness, AV1 decode, and a Space Black color option. Accumulatively, this makes for quite a small upgrade for existing users of the 2021 MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing which 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro model to buy ultimately comes down to what level of performance you require. For example, the M3 series of chips feature a redesigned GPU with hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, which may be an attractive upgrade for some users, but it is far from essential for the vast majority. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro users who are mulling an upgrade to an M3 Pro machine should also be aware that it features reduced memory bandwidth and one less GPU core. <br/>
<br/>
Generally, unless you need peak performance for demanding professional workflows, it will not be worth upgrading from a 2021 MacBook Pro to a 2023 model, or from an early 2023 machine to a late 2023 model. Only those who need the M3's redesigned GPU and hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, or more than 12 CPU cores, 38 GPU cores, or 96GB memory will really benefit.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M2-Feature-Blue-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-881249" /><br/>
For those who have not yet made the leap to an Apple silicon machine, the 2021 and early 2023 MacBook Pro models are still very good options if you can get them for a significantly low price. It is only worth paying more to get the latest model if you want a future-proof device to keep for the long term, where slightly better performance, battery life, and specifications like Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1 are likely to be more beneficial through successive software updates and as connectivity needs with other devices evolve. Even then, it is difficult to recommend buying a late 2023 MacBook Pro at full price over an equivalent, heavily discounted early 2023 model.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you are considering upgrading across the product lineup, such as going from a 2021 or early 2023 14-inch MacBook Pro to a 16-inch model, it may be worth buying the latest model to capture its handful of other improvements.<br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip effectively replaces the previous 13-inch MacBook Pro, which featured the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip in 2020 and the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in 2022. For users of these older MacBook Pro models, the new low-cost 14-inch model represents a substantial upgrade, featuring a larger display with a mini-LED panel, a 1080p camera, a six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers, an HDMI 2.1 port and an SDXC card slot, fast charging and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> 3, and two extra hours of battery life.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-pro-upgraders-buyers-guide/">2023 MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 20+ Differences Compared Across Generations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2023-macbook-pro-buyers-guide-20-differences-compared-across-generations.2377515/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to add blood pressure monitoring and sleep apnea detection to an Apple Watch with an updated design in 2024, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-11-01/apple-health-blood-pressure-glucose-sleep-apnea-team-issues">report</a> covering the arc of Apple's heath-related ambitions, Gurman outlines the first iteration of the company's "pathbreaking" blood pressure sensor technology coming next year that will include hypertension detection:<br/>
<blockquote>The system is designed to just tell a user if their blood pressure is trending upward and to offer a journal for the user to jot down what was happening when hypertension occurred. To avoid potentially giving a misdiagnosis, the feature will then direct a user to talk to their doctor or check their blood pressure with a traditional cuff, which can provide exact systolic and diastolic measurements. </blockquote>A future version of the system in development can provide exact numbers and even diagnose related conditions, according to Gurman. However, these enhancements "remain far off," he adds.<br/>
<br/>
Also coming in 2024 is an Apple Watch-based sleep apnea detection feature. According to the report, it will use sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition, and then direct users to see a physician.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-watch-blood-glucose-up-to-seven-years-away/">previously reported</a>, Apple is also working on non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. Apple's system is said to use a silicon photonics chip to shine light from a laser under the skin to determine the concentration of glucose in the body.<br/>
<br/>
The glucose monitoring has been designed in a similar way to the blood pressure system, in that it currently monitors how a person's blood sugar is trending and warns users of pre-diabetes, rather than offer an actual blood sugar reading.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple's blood glucose monitoring efforts remain unlikely to show up in a product for "at least a few years," according to Gurman's latest report, citing people with knowledge of the efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Away from Apple Watch, Apple is also said to be on course to bring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/12/gurman-airpods-to-gain-hearing-health-features/">hearing aid detection</a> to AirPods in 2024. Equipped with the new feature, AirPods will be able to function as an over-the-counter hearing aid and be able to perform the hearing tests typically administered in audiologists' offices.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Apple is said to be continuing to explore ways to make the upcoming Apple Vision Pro headset into a health device, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-explores-vision-pro-health-capabilities/">reported previously</a> by <em>The Information</em>. Anti-anxiety and enhanced meditation features are being worked on, as well as a virtual-reality system to reinforce positive thinking and improve mental health.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also been studying using the sensors in the device to scan a wearer's eyes for cognitive health data, while a headset version of Fitness+ "remains on the table," according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>Bloomberg</em> report additionally includes some interesting backstory on Apple's evolving health and healthcare initiatives in recent years, as well as an update on the company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/apple-primary-healthcare-service-wsj/">paid health coaching service in development</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has launched Tap to Pay on iPhone in Ukraine, allowing independent sellers, small merchants, and large retailers in the country to use ‌iPhones‌ as a payment terminal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/tap-to-pay-ukraine.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920037" /><br/>
Ukraine becomes the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tap-to-pay/#regions">seventh region</a> to support Tap to Pay, following similar rollouts in the U.K., Australia, Taiwan, Brazil, and the Netherlands earlier in the year.<br/>
<br/>
The feature was introduced in the United States in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/08/apple-announces-tap-to-pay-iphone-feature/">February 2022</a>, and allows compatible iPhones to accept payments via Apple Pay, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets, using only an ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌ - no additional hardware or credit card machine is required‌.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://en.privatbank.ua/news/2023/10/31/2067">PrivatBank</a> is the first payment platform to offer Tap to Pay on ‌iPhone‌ to its Ukraine-based business customers. Apple's system‌‌‌‌ uses NFC technology to securely authenticate the contactless payments, plus the feature also supports PIN entry, which includes accessibility options.<br/>
<blockquote>"We are delighted to launch Tap to Pay on iPhone for entrepreneurs and businesses in Ukraine and to be providing this simple and secure solution that offers greater flexibility for accepting payments for businesses of all sizes, from street vendors to large retailers," said Gerhard Boesch, chairman of the board of PrivatBank. "As a state-owned bank with the largest share of small and medium-sized businesses, we feel a great responsibility to support businesses to scale – and save – with fast, in-person payment solutions."</blockquote>Tap to Pay on ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌ requires ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌ XS or newer models, and works for customers as any normal ‌‌‌‌Apple Pay‌‌‌‌ transaction would. Sellers just need to open up the app, register the sale, and present their ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌ to the buyer, who can then use an appropriate contactless payment method.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple announced three new devices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">during its "Scary Fast" event</a> on Monday, including updated 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac models, all with M3 series chips. Apple did not announce any other products during the 30-minute event, which was likely the company's final presentation this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Scary-Fast-Event-Rumor-Report-Card-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919979" /><br/>
Below, our latest rumor report card provides a look at which rumors were right and wrong or a mix of both following Apple's event.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Accurate</h2><ul><li><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple would likely hold a Mac launch event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-mac-launch-event-coming-october-30-or-31/">on October 30 or October 31</a>.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman said the new 24-inch iMac would skip the M2 chip and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/next-gen-imac-details-rumored-ahead-of-event/">go right to the M3 chip</a>.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman revealed several accurate <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect">CPU core counts, GPU core counts, and RAM amounts</a> for the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips in the new MacBook Pro models.</li><br/>
<li>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-march-2024-launch/">both</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">ruled out new iPads</a> for the rest of 2023, and this event indeed lacked any iPad announcements.</li><br/>
<li>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/alleged-macbook-pro-box-image/">box for the new MacBook Pro leaked</a> on Chinese social media website Weibo.</li></ul><br/>
<h2>Inaccurate</h2><ul><li><em>MacRumors</em> discovered that an Apple supplier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/apple-scary-fast-event-battery-filings/">resubmitted a sixth-generation iPad mini battery filing</a> in a Chinese regulatory database last week, and speculated about the possibility of a seventh-generation iPad mini using the same battery being announced at the event, but this did not happen.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman reported that Apple would likely announce updated versions of the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad for the Mac <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">with USB-C ports for charging</a>, but the accessories are still equipped with Lightning.</li><br/>
<li>Japanese blog <em>Mac Otakara</em> believed that the next 24-inch iMac would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/imac-m2-and-m2-pro-rumor/">equipped with M2 and M2 Pro chips</a>, but it has the M3 chip.</li></ul><h2>Mixed</h2><ul><li>Kuo initially claimed that new MacBooks with M3 series chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">were unlikely to launch this year</a>, but he later reversed course and said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/">new MacBook Pro models with M3 series chips would be announced</a> at the event.</li><br/>
<li>Gurman initially claimed that new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models were on track to launch <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-15/apple-october-2023-executive-promotions-new-vps-of-retail-software-operations-lnrh4t94">in early to spring 2024</a>, but he later reversed course and said that the laptops would be announced at the event.</li><br/>
<li><em>MacRumors</em> published a report speculating that Apple's event would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-event-mac-gaming-focus-likely/">likely have an emphasis on high-end gaming on the Mac</a>. The new M3 series chips for the Mac do feature hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games, as the report mentioned, but the unconfirmed tip that we mentioned about the event having a Japanese developer tie-in was inaccurate.</li></ul><h2>Undetermined</h2><ul><li>Prior to the event, Kuo said the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">24-inch iMac would be updated in 2024</a>, but he did not explicitly rule out a new model in 2023.</li></ul><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/scary-fast-apple-event-rumor-report-card/">&#039;Scary Fast&#039; Rumor Report Card: New MacBook Pros and iMac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/scary-fast-rumor-report-card-new-macbook-pros-and-imac.2409441/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models may be equipped with an extra button, according to <a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Weibo leaker Instant Digital</a>, who has shared accurate details on Apple's plans in the past. Instant Digital claims that there is a "great chance" of getting an additional button, with Apple also planning to relocate the mmWave antenna to the left of the device instead of the right to accommodate the change.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro Action Button will supposedly sit flush with the device, as Apple is expected to transition to solid-state technology for the button rather than the current standard button design.<br/>
<br/>
Though changes are expected to the Action Button, the volume keys and the power keys are said to remain the same with no changes. These buttons are not solid-state at the current time, though Apple's plans could change.<br/>
<br/>
The information shared by Instant Digital echoes details that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/"><em>MacRumors</em> published in late September</a> highlighting the extra button that is expected to come to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. Apple is calling this button the "Capture Button" internally, but it continues to be unclear what exactly it will be used for. The button will be located under the power button on the right side of the device, and it will be a capacitive button rather than a standard button.<br/>
<br/>
We also previously outlined the repositioning of the mmWave antenna to the space under the volume buttons, and the adoption of solid-state technology for the Action Button. Our sources have indicated that the new button is set to be introduced on all &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, including the base &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Setsuna Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/">iPhone 16 Could Feature Extra Button, Relocated mmWave Antenna and Haptic Action Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-could-feature-extra-button-relocated-mmwave-antenna-and-haptic-action-button.2409439/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fifth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that runs on the Vision Pro headset. The fourth beta <a href="hhttps://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-releases-visionos-beta-4/">came out in early October</a>, so it has been nearly a month since Apple last released a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people do not have access to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta outside of Xcode, and it is not entirely clear what Apple is adding in each &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update. Apple has said that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> will be coming to &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; soon, and it appears that it may be present in this fifth beta. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It looks like visionOS Beta 5 has the App Store! <a href="https://t.co/RIL9u9sBQB">pic.twitter.com/RIL9u9sBQB</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1719457938740248708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple is letting developers attend Vision Pro labs around the world, and developers who visit these locations are able to test the Vision Pro in person and get help from Apple engineers on their &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is not expected until early 2024, so Apple still has several months to refine the hardware and software.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/apple-releases-visionos-beta-5/">Apple&#039;s Work on visionOS Continues With Beta 5 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-work-on-visionos-continues-with-beta-5-launch.2409431/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a new firmware update designed for the AirTag item trackers. The firmware features a build number of 2A61, up from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/12/apple-releases-airtags-firmware-update-2a36/">the 2A36 firmware</a> that came out last December.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813264" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/AitTag-New-Firmware.jpg" alt="" width="2390" height="1344" /><br/>
It has been nearly a year since Apple updated the firmware on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a>, and there is no word yet on what might be included in the update.<br/>
<br/>
Today's firmware release will be rolling out on a staggered basis. One percent of users will get the update today, and then it will expand to 10 percent of users on November 7. On November 14, an additional 25 percent of users will see the update, and then it will be available to all on November 28.<br/>
<br/>
It is not possible to force an AirTag update, as it's something that's done over-the-air through a connected <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device. You can check your current AirTag firmware version through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> app, with instructions <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-airtags-firmware-version/">available in our how to</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232">AirTags</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/airtags-firmware-update/">Apple Releases New Firmware for AirTags</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-airtags.2409423/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">announced on Monday</a> are available <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-unveils-new-space-black-color-for-m3-pro-and-m3-max-macbook-pro/">in a new Space Black finish</a> when configured with M3 Pro or M3 Max chips. Notably, Apple says this finish features an "anodization seal" to "greatly reduce fingerprints."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Toms-Guide-Space-Black-MacBook-Pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919950" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Space Black MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-pro-16-inch-m3-2023">via Tom's Guide</a></em></div><br/>
Apple already made the MacBook Air available in a darker Midnight finish, and it is considered by many to be a fingerprint magnet. Based on hands-on videos of the new MacBook Pro models shared following Apple's event, the new anti-fingerprint seal does appear to be an improvement compared to the MacBook Air, but more testing is needed.<br/>
<br/>
In the hands-on video below, <em>The Verge</em>'s Dan Seifert said "I got like 30 seconds to touch the new Space Black model, and yeah, I guess there are fewer fingerprints on it, but we'll really have to see how it holds up in the real world."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUyKtOj3cks?si=Eeti2Ez1O_1XqrH2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/a-magic-number-new-macbook-pros-and-imacs-usher-in-the-m3-era/"><em>Six Colors</em> editor-in-chief Jason Snell said</a> the Space Black finish is "generally more resistant to fingerprints," but he said some fingerprints are still to be expected. He also said Space Black is more like a "dark gray" instead of actual black:<blockquote>I got my greasy monkey paws on a Space Black laptop and can report that Apple's as good as its word in the sense that it seems generally more resistant to fingerprints and other smudges.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't want to exaggerate this feature: you can still see fingerprints. They just aren't as prominent. This is a progressive improvement over something like the Midnight M2 MacBook Air, but it's not a cure-all.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, I need to warn you not to get too excited about Apple finally making a black MacBook Pro. Space Black is not actually as black as space. It's a dark gray. Yes, it's appreciably darker than the Space Gray on the current MacBook Pros (and the new base model), but it's still a shimmery metallic gray. Fans of Darth Vader stand down.</blockquote>Another hands-on video from Brian Tong:<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-RhNLERfLE?si=ebV-C8JDICR9rYrA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2023/10/30/apple-reveals-new-m3-chip-powered-macbook-pro-line/"><em>MobileSyrup</em>'s Patrick O'Rourke</a> said "I have very greasy fingers and spent several minutes in the hands-on area trying to smudge the 'Space Black' colour — I couldn't."<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/hands-on-with-the-apple-m3-macbook-pro-1850976095"><em>Gizmodo</em>'s Kyle Barr</a> said "I did have the chance to put my grubby hands on the newest M3-powered MacBook Pros, and while I didn't see many leftover smears on the surface, it didn't take long for Apple staff to swoop in with microfiber cloth in hand to remove any wayward stains," so testing will be needed outside of a controlled environment.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hands-on-apple-m3-macs/"><em>XDA</em>'s Brady Snyder</a> on Space Black and fingerprints:<blockquote>Though the changes to the M3 MacBook Pro were mostly internal, there's a new color called Space Black. It looks better in person than it did in Apple's unveiling, but it's still not black. I'd compare it to the black color of the iPhone 5 or the iPad mini 2. It's still nowhere near the black color we saw on the polycarbonate MacBooks in the mid-2000s. As you can see in the photos below, this MacBook can look lighter and darker based on lighting conditions, much like Apple's Midnight colorway. However, compared to that color, the MacBook Pro does seem to be less of a fingerprint magnet.</blockquote>The new MacBook Pro models are available to order now, and most configurations will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/">shared a behind-the-scenes look</a> at the video production of its recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">"Scary Fast" M3 MacBook Pro event</a>, which was shot entirely on iPhone 15 Pro Max and edited on Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3dbG9pAi8I?si=x-T5g9jOpAsQEse4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Titled "Behind the Scenes: An Apple Event" and running two minutes and 16 seconds, the video shared on YouTube reveals how footage was captured using multiple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices, with the production team utilizing integration between iPhone 15 Pro, the Blackmagic Camera app, and Tentacle Sync.<br/>
<br/>
Connected via Bluetooth, Tentacle Sync drives timecode and enables all devices on set — including Macs and preview screens — to be synced throughout the production. Beastgrip accessories, including cages and rigs, were also used during the production, as well as cranes, dollies, gimbals, and drones. <br/>
<br/>
Interview clips with the directors, producers, and editors explain how the capabilities of the iPhone 15 Pro allowed them to work effectively with low light conditions, which is traditionally a bit more challenging for a standard video camera. <br/>
<br/>
The production was advised by Apple's Jon Carr, a Pro Workflow video specialist whose credits include <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> and <em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em>, and Jeff Wozniak, who has worked on productions including <em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>Iron Man 2</em>.<br/>
<blockquote>"When I first got the footage from iPhone 15 Pro Max, I was immediately pleasantly surprised," said Stefan Sonnenfeld, Company 3's CEO, who colored the presentation and has worked on projects including Stranger Things, The Equalizer 3, and Fast X. "The quality of the image on iPhone 15 Pro Max is incredible, and it's there. And I know because I've done it and I've seen it, and we're doing this project with it."</blockquote><br/>
The video specialists also espoused the benefits of being able to shoot directly to external storage and use Apple Log to access more dynamic range in post production.<br/>
<br/>
The ‌‌iPhone 15‌ Pro‌ and iPhone 15 Pro Max models feature an improved camera system, including a main camera with a larger sensor, a new coating to reduce lens flare, optical image stabilization, and better low light performance for Portraits and Night mode.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shot-on-iphone/">Shot on iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/apple-video-scary-fast-event-shot-iphone-15-pro/">Apple Reveals How &#039;Scary Fast&#039; Event Was Shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reveals-how-scary-fast-event-was-shot-on-iphone-15-pro-max.2409406/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Chrome users on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> can now opt to move the Chrome address bar to the bottom of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display, mirroring a design change that Apple implemented in Safari last year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/chrome-address-bar-ios.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919879" /><br/>
Chrome for iOS can be customized to have the URL bar at the top or the bottom of the interface depending on where the user prefers it to be. Google says this is a feature that Chrome users have been requesting for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
To move the Chrome address bar, long press on it and then choose the "Move address bar to the bottom" option. Users can also navigate to the Settings menu and choose "address bar" to change the bar's position.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome-for-ios/">Chrome for iOS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/chrome-ios-address-bar-reposition/">Google Chrome for iOS Now Lets You Move URL Bar to Bottom of iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-chrome-for-ios-now-lets-you-move-url-bar-to-bottom-of-iphone.2409404/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At its "Scary Fast" event, Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">new 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac models</a> with M3 series chips. It was a very quick and tidy 30-minute event, with no other products or surprises revealed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Event-October-2023.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919098" /><br/>
Below, we have listed some rumored products that were not announced at the event.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Magic Accessories With USB-C</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-Magic-Keyboard-and-Mouse.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919840" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that Apple's event would likely include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">updated versions of the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad</a> for the Mac with USB-C ports for charging, but the accessories are still equipped with Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPads</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPad-mini-6-orange-BG.jpg" alt="" width="1881" height="1058" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816576" /><br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Gurman both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">ruled out new iPads</a> for the rest of 2023, and this event indeed lacked any iPad announcements.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> had discovered that an Apple supplier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/apple-scary-fast-event-battery-filings/">resubmitted</a> a sixth-generation iPad mini battery filing in a Chinese regulatory database last week, but this ultimately did not relate to a seventh-generation iPad mini at the event.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said Apple does not plan to introduce new iPads <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-march-2024-launch/">until March 2024 or later</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iMac Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
While the Intel-based iMac Pro was discontinued in 2021, there have been rumors about an eventual Apple silicon replacement ever since.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Gurman said Apple still has plans to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">larger pro version of the iMac with a 32-inch display</a> in either late 2024 or in 2025. It's unclear which chips this Mac would be equipped with. On a speculative basis, it could use the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips announced yesterday, or perhaps even an upcoming M3 Ultra chip, but Apple might be on to the M4 series of chips by time the new iMac Pro is announced.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the new iMac Pro will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">feature mini-LED backlighting</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Air and Mac Mini</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898577" /><br/>
To be clear, new MacBook Air and Mac mini models were not expected to be announced at this event, but they are worth mentioning given that they will likely use the same M3 or M3 Pro chips that were announced yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman expects updated 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the standard M3 chip to be released <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect">in the first half of 2024</a>. He also said Apple is already working on a new Mac mini, but he did not provide a launch timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPower</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/09/airpower.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="448" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-587742" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C are available for the all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a> today on Amazon, down from &#36;249.00. This is a match of the previous low price that we tracked during Prime Day earlier in the month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895407" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Amazon is the only retailer offering this record low price as of writing, and there's an estimated delivery window of November 2 through November 5 for most places in the United States. The deal has been automatically applied, so you won't need to clip any coupon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset. Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
We're seeing a lot of AirPods-related deals on Amazon as we head into November, including the AirPods 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;99.00</strong></a> (&#36;30 off), AirPods 3 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;149.99</strong></a> (&#36;19 off), AirPods Pro 2 (Lightning) for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a> (&#36;60 off), and the AirPods Max for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZDSP2Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;479.99</strong></a> (&#36;69 off).<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Choosing a new Mac often involves consideration of the many Apple silicon chips now on offer, so our comprehensive guide covers their generations, variations, and performance benchmarks to help you decide which is best for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Mac-Chip-Comparison-Buyers-Guide-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-902570" /><br/>
After iterating for over a decade in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Apple in 2020 brought its custom silicon chip technology to the Mac, enabling major performance and power efficiency improvements. Since then, Apple silicon has expanded to every Mac model, spurring new designs and capabilities that were previously impossible.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Apple-M3-chip-series.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920046" /><br/>
<br/>
Understanding the distinctions between Apple silicon chips will help you make an informed decision when selecting the right Mac for your needs. There have been three generations of Apple silicon for the Mac, each with up to four different chip variants. The main differences between the four different chip variants are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>M1, M2, and M3</strong>: Standard Apple silicon chip with a balance of performance and power-efficiency. </li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Pro, M2 Pro, and M3 Pro</strong>: Apple silicon chip with additional high-performance CPU cores. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Pro feature twice the memory bandwidth of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 chips (200GB/s), while the M3 Pro features 50% more memory bandwidth than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 chips (150GB/s).</li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Max, M2 Max, and M3 Max</strong>: Doubles the GPU cores of the &zwnj;M1 Pro&zwnj;, &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro, or M3 Pro and features up to twice the memory bandwidth (400GB/s) of the &zwnj;M1 Pro&zwnj; or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro chips for better graphics performance. M3 Max also adds extra CPU cores.</li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Ultra and M2 Ultra</strong>: Encompasses two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/">M1 Max</a> or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips for double overall CPU and GPU performance, as well as twice the memory bandwidth (800GB/s).</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="apple_silicon_generations">Apple Silicon Generations</h3><br/>
With the introduction of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; series of chips in 2022 and M3 series of chips in 2023, Apple made some key improvements over the initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> series from 2020.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/m1-vs-m2-macbook-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-851913" /><br/>
The below table provides a comparison between the &zwnj;M1&zwnj;, &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, and M3 series, highlighting differences in the chips they are based on, node, CPU clock speed, Neural Engines, and more:<br/>

<h3 id="cpu_and_gpu_cores">CPU and GPU Cores</h3><br/>
CPU cores are individual processing units within a Central Processing Unit (CPU) responsible for executing instructions and performing general-purpose tasks, while GPU cores are specialized units within a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) designed for parallel processing and graphics-intensive tasks.<br/>
<br/>

Deciding how many CPU cores you need depends on the specific tasks and workflows you intend to perform on your Mac. For example, if you primarily engage in basic tasks like web browsing, document editing, and media consumption, an eight-core chip should suffice. On the other hand, if you work with demanding workloads like software development, opting for a higher core count can provide significant performance benefits. Similarly, graphics-intense workflows like video editing, 3D modeling, or gaming will benefit from additional GPU cores.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h3><br/>
Computer benchmark scores are standardized measurements that evaluate the performance of chips, providing a numerical representation for comparing capabilities and assessing performance against industry standards.<br/>
<br/>

Both the &zwnj;M1&zwnj;, &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, and M3 chips demonstrate performance improvements in single-core and multi-core tasks as you move from the base to the Ultra variants, with the M3 chip showcasing even higher performance across the board. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that benchmarks do not tell the whole story. Benchmarks focus on specific tasks and synthetic workloads, and do not always accurately capture real-world usage scenarios and variations.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="unified_memory">Unified Memory</h3><br/>
Apple silicon chips have a unified memory architecture, meaning that the RAM is tied directly to the processor for maximum speed and efficiency. This means that the chip you choose determines what memory option are available, and it is not upgradable at a later date. <br/>

Deciding how much RAM you need depends on your specific tasks and usage patterns. 8GB should be enough for most users, but upgrading to 16GB or 24GB could be sensible for users with more intense multitasking requirements. Amounts of memory beyond 32GB are generally reserved for seriously demanding workflows.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h3 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><br/>
Overall, if you are new to Apple silicon and are still not sure which chip to buy, use the following rationale:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1, M2, or M3 if...</strong> you need a good balance of price, performance, and battery life and have normal day-to-day computing requirements.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1 Pro, M2 Pro, or M3 Pro if...</strong> you need a performance-focused chip for slightly more intense workflows.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1 Max, M2 Max, or M3 Max if...</strong> you need additional graphics performance for working with images, videos, graphic design, or games.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1 Ultra or M2 Ultra if...</strong> you need the best possible overall performance for extremely intense professional workflows.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
It is generally not worth upgrading from any of the individual &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chips to their direct successors and it may be better to wait for Apple to launch the M4 series of chips at some point in the next couple of years before upgrading.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/">MacBook Pro 13"</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13">13" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro">Mac Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1">Mac Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon-buyers-guide/">Apple Silicon Buyer&#039;s Guide: All the Differences Explained</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-silicon-buyers-guide-all-the-differences-explained.2395320/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
