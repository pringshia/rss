		<description><![CDATA[Apple is selling refurbished iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max models to its <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/iphone/">online store</a> in the United Kingdom, around four months after introducing the discounted models in other European countries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iphone-15-pro-box.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1964" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918442" /><br/>
The iPhone 15 is priced starting at £589, while the iPhone 15 Plus is priced starting at £759. The iPhone 15 Pro is priced starting at £869, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max is priced starting at £949. Prices are discounted about 15 percent compared to brand new models.<br/>
<br/>
Several color and storage options are available at the time of writing, but availability may change as Apple updates its inventory. If you're after a specific combination, it's worth checking back regularly to see what's in stock.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first introduced iPhone 15 models in Europe back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/apple-begins-selling-refurb-iphone-15-europe/">January</a>, while the models were added to Apple's refurb stores in the U.S. and Canada <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/refurbished-iphone-15-us-store/">this week</a>. Archived webpage snapshots indicate the iPhone 15 models were added to the regional UK online store sometime around late April.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's refurbished iPhones are unlocked, meaning they work with any carrier. Each device comes with a brand-new battery, a fresh outer shell, and a new USB-C cable—making them virtually indistinguishable from brand-new models. Refurbished iPhones also include Apple's standard one-year warranty, with the option to add AppleCare+ for extended coverage.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/07/refurbished-iphone-15-models-apple-online-store-uk/">Refurb iPhone 15 Models Now Available From Apple&#039;s UK Online Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/refurb-iphone-15-models-now-available-from-apples-uk-online-store.2456650/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google this week targeted the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> in an ad for the Pixel 9 Pro, mocking Apple's design plans and suggesting that Apple often copies Android features.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="#BestPhonesForever: Responding to the Rumors" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A26C66LX2AA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; isn't released, of course, so Google's ad is based on rumors that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is going to get a horizontal camera bar at the back, which is a Pixel-esque design. Dummy models and mockups of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; depict a thick horizontal camera bar for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models, and a slimmer, more Pixel-style camera bar for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Google's Pixel lineup has long used a horizontal camera bar, but it has lenses arranged in a horizontal line. Apple plans to continue to use a triangular arrangement for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models, and will simply expand the camera bump.<br/>
<br/>
In the ad, Google points out that the Pixel had a horizontal camera bar first, before delving into other features that Apple has allegedly copied. The video is positioned as a "podcast" featuring a Pixel phone and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<blockquote>Pixel: Hi, I'm Pixel, and this is my friend, iPhone.<br/>
iPhone: Good day.<br/>
Pixel: There are a lot of rumors circulating about iPhone's upcoming redesign.<br/>
iPhone: It's crazy. Can you imagine me doing the same thing you did first years later?</blockquote><br/>
Google highlights <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/">Night Mode</a>, Clean Up, and widgets as examples of features that were available on Android first. The video wraps up with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; copying a line that the Pixel says first: "We want to remind everyone that these rumors are just rumors."<br/>
<br/>
"Please don't go repeating everything you see," reads the video description. Google has used the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android ad format <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/21/google-pixel-anti-iphone-ad-series/">in the past</a> to mock Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; design decisions, most recently targeting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/google-pokes-fun-iphone-15-usb-c-adoption/">Apple's switch to USB-C</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/google-mocks-iphone-17-design/">Google Mocks iPhone 17 Design Rumors in Pixel 9 Pro Ad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-mocks-iphone-17-design-rumors-in-pixel-9-pro-ad.2456636/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Epic Games Has Paid Over &#36;100 Million in Legal Fees to Fight Apple&#039;s App Store Rules</title>

		<description><![CDATA[It has cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> more than &#36;100 million to challenge Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules in the ongoing Apple vs. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; legal battle, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said today in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-sweeeney-epic-games-apple-app-store-interview-peter-kafka-2025-05">Business Insider</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/app-store-blue-banner-epic-1.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800065" /><br/>
Sweeney said that &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; has paid "legal bills" in excess of &#36;100 million, but that the dispute has cost the company a lot more.<br/>
<blockquote>But if you look at lost revenue, that's another story. We can't predict exactly how much we would have made on iOS, but in the two years that we were on the platform, Fortnite had made about &#36;300 million on iOS. So you could have projected hundreds of millions of dollars of lost revenue as a result of the fight.</blockquote><br/>
Sweeney went on to say that one could "easily imagine" that the total cost to &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; was a billion dollars or more based on lost revenue from iOS users, and lost revenue from people who didn't play because their friends on iOS weren't able to play.<br/>
<br/>
While &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; largely lost its court case against Apple when a judge found that Apple did not have a monopoly, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; scored a win because Apple was forced to drop its anti-steering &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; policies.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a> legal battle, Apple was given an order to allow developers to direct customers to purchase options outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apple was able to put off implementing the functionality for several years, but in 2024, did so in a way that still involved fees.<br/>
<br/>
Just last week, the judge overseeing the Apple vs. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; legal fight said that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-rule-change-appeal/">was in contempt of court</a> for failing to properly comply with the injunction. Apple was ordered to immediately implement new U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules allowing developers to add links to external websites where customers can make purchases. Apple is not allowed to collect commissions for purchases made using these links, nor can it control the look of the links or buttons that developers use.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-appeals-app-store-payment-rule-changes/">appealing the decision</a>, but in the meantime, it's a win for developers, and a win that was funded by &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;. Sweeney said last week that &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; would be bringing Fortnite <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-apple-peace-proposal/">back to the iOS App Store</a> in the U.S. as a result of the ruling, and in the interview with <em>Business Insider</em>, he said that Fortnite would be taking advantage of Apple's new policies "later this week."<br/>
<br/>
Apple banned &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;' U.S. developer account, but the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/epic-games-fortnite-us-app-store/">has an account in Sweden</a> that it will use to bring Fortnite back to the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Sweeney said that he would be "very surprised" if Apple "decided to brave the geopolitical storm of blocking a major app from iOS." He confirmed that &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; has informed Apple of what its plans are, so Apple is presumably aware that Fortnite will soon be submitted to the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Later this year, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; also plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/epic-games-webshops-ios-developers/">launch Epic Games Store Webshops</a>, a feature that will let developers launch digital storefronts that are hosted by the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store. Webshops will be free for developers making under &#36;1 million annually per app, and for bigger developers, Epic will collect a 12 percent fee.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/epic-games-legal-fees/">Epic Games Has Paid Over &#36;100 Million in Legal Fees to Fight Apple&#039;s App Store Rules</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-has-paid-over-100-million-in-legal-fees-to-fight-apples-app-store-rules.2456635/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today said that it's adding a new "Simplify" feature to the Google app for iOS, with the addition aimed at making search results easier to understand.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/google-search-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000802" /><br/>
Google says that Simplify is meant to help users understand "jargon" or unfamiliar technical concepts, including medical words that the average person would not know, and technical terms. It uses AI to make "dense text on the web" simpler to comprehend without the user having to leave a website to do more research.<br/>
<br/>
To use Simplify in the Google app for iOS, users can select any complex text on a webpage and then tap on the "Simplify" icon to see a new, simpler version.<br/>
<br/>
Simplify uses a prompt refinement approach that was developed by Google Research, taking advantage of Gemini to make complicated text more digestible without losing key details. In <a href="https://research.google/blog/making-complex-text-understandable-minimally-lossy-text-simplification-with-gemini/">a research paper</a>, Google said that users selected to test the feature were better able to understand complicated medical, financial, legal, and technical websites when queried after using the Simplify feature.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/google-search-ios-app-simplify/">Google Search App Can Now &#039;Simplify&#039; Complex Search Results</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-search-app-can-now-simplify-complex-search-results.2456631/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung this month <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introduces-new-tap-to-transfer-feature-for-samsung-wallet/">will begin supporting</a> a new peer-to-peer Tap to Transfer feature through the Samsung Wallet, providing another way for users to tap their smartphones together to send one another cash without the need for an app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/samsung-tap-to-transfer.jpg" alt="" width="1809" height="1017" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000780" /><br/>
Tap to Transfer is similar to Tap to Cash, a feature that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/tap-to-cash-ios-18-pay-touch-iphones/">introduced in iOS 18</a>, and Apple's Tap to Pay on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. With Tap to Cash, Apple users with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or Apple Watch can send or receive Apple Cash by holding two devices next to each other. The transfer happens using NFC, and no personal information like phone number or email is shared.<br/>
<br/>
Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is an option that allows independent sellers, small businesses, and larger merchants to use an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as a contactless payment terminal to accept payments from other &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users, debit and credit cards that support tap payments, and other digital wallets. Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; does still require a payment app like Shopify, Square, or Clover, but Tap to Transfer from Samsung does not.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's Tap to Transfer option lets Samsung users quickly send payments to anyone with a debit card that supports tap features, even if that debit card is stored in another digital wallet like Apple Wallet. As long as the Samsung user has a Samsung Wallet with an eligible Visa or Mastercard debit card, they can send money over NFC to another person without a Samsung Wallet.<br/>
<blockquote>Through Samsung's collaboration with Visa and Mastercard, you can use a debit card stored in your Samsung Wallet to send money to friends and family members' bank accounts without needing to download an additional app. Instead, Samsung Wallet uses NFC technology to connect to the recipient's debit card stored in their digital wallet. Plus, you can even transfer money to people without a digital wallet as long as they have a physical debit card with tap-to-pay capabilities.</blockquote><br/>
With Tap to Transfer, a Samsung user can easily send payments to anyone, including an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user, but there is no equivalent feature for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user to send a payment to a Samsung user because Apple Cash is more limited, and Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; requires a secondary payment service.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung users will also be able to tap two Samsung devices together to send payments, similar to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s Tap to Cash option.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/samsung-tap-to-transfer/">Samsung Gets New &#039;Tap to Transfer&#039; Option That Works for Sending Payments to iPhone Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-gets-new-tap-to-transfer-option-that-works-for-sending-payments-to-iphone-users.2456629/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Justice Department wants Google to make major changes to its ad business in order to restore competition, with the government suggesting that Google divest both Ad Exchange (AdX) and Ad Manager (often referred to as DFP).<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837104" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The DoJ made the recommendation in an updated filing submitted as part of its ongoing antitrust fight with Google. Last month, Google was found to have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/google-ad-tech-antitrust-ruling/">illegal monopoly in online advertising</a>, manipulating the market to cause harm to advertisers, publishers, and consumers. The court is now mulling remedies to curb Google's behavior, and it is considering suggestions from the DoJ.<br/>
<br/>
AdX is Google's ad exchange marketplace where advertisers can purchase ad space from publishers in real-time through auctions, while DFP is an ad management platform that publishers can use for ad inventory management, selling, scheduling, and managing ad inventory. The DoJ wants Google to sell off AdX right away, and do a phased divestiture of DFP.<br/>
<br/>
The DoJ also suggests that Google's AdWords product should deal with all third-party ad tech tools on non-discriminatory terms for bidding, matching, and placement of ads, and that Google should be prohibited from preferentially routing buyside demand from AdWords to any as exchange or publisher ad server. Google may also be required to share key ad server data and prohibited from using data gathered from Google Search, Gmail, and other Google properties to evaluate digital ad inventory on third-party tools and websites.<br/>
<br/>
Google is also facing off with the Department of Justice over search, as the company was found to have an online search monopoly as well. Google could be forced to sell off the Chrome browser and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/google-search-crippled-antitrust-remedies/">make major changes to data sharing</a> that would impact Google Search's market dominance.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/google-ad-business-breakup/">Google Facing Breakup of Ad Business as DOJ Recommends Divestiture After Antitrust Ruling</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-facing-breakup-of-ad-business-as-doj-recommends-divestiture-after-antitrust-ruling.2456628/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate version of iOS 18.5 to developers and public beta testers, giving us a look at the final version of the update that will be provided to the public next week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iOS-18.5-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999304" /><br/>
With the release candidate, Apple provided release notes, so we have a more complete look at the new features that are included in the update, including those that weren't found during the beta testing period.<br/>
<br/>
The update adds a new wallpaper that matches this year's Pride Apple Watch Band, along with a new parental alert when a child is able to bypass the Screen Time passcode.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2025/05/apple-tv-announces-fifth-season-for-beloved-comedy-trying-starring-esther-smith-and-rafe-spall/">today</a> <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2025/05/apples-global-hit-star-studded-comedy-the-studio-lands-season-two-renewal/">announced</a> it has renewed two acclaimed comedy series, with <em>Trying</em> and <em>The Studio</em> each set to return for an additional season on Apple TV+.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/trying-apple-tv-plus.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800380" /><br/>
<em>Trying</em> is a feel-good series that follows British couple Nikki (Esther Smith) and Jason (Rafe Spall), on their journey to adopt a child and beyond. The series has achieved an average score of 95% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 93% score from the public. The series will be returning for a fifth season, but a timeframe was not disclosed.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Studio</em> is a satirical series about Hollywood's film industry. In it, Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, the newly-appointed head of the embattled Continental Studios. The show's first season is still underway, with three episodes remaining, and now it will be returning for a second season at some point in the future. <em>The Studio</em> has a 93% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes, but its audience score lags behind at a respectable 70%.<br/>
<br/>

Apple TV+ still lacks mass appeal compared to some other streaming services, but many of the original series available through the service are highly rated. In the U.S., Apple TV+ costs &#36;9.99 per month, or &#36;99 per year. Apple TV+ can be accessed through the Apple TV app on a wide variety of devices, and on the web at <a href="https://tv.apple.com/">tv.apple.com</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/two-apple-tv-plus-comedy-series-renewed/">Two Highly-Rated Apple TV+ Series Renewed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-highly-rated-apple-tv-series-renewed.2456625/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added refurbished <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max models <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/iphone/iphone-15-iphone-15-plus-iphone-15-pro-iphone-15-pro-max">to its online store</a> in the United States and Canada, offering the smartphones at a discounted price.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911429" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;619 in the United States, while the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus is priced starting at &#36;699. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro is priced starting at &#36;759, and the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max is priced starting at &#36;929. Prices are discounted about 15 percent compared to brand new models.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple colors and capacities can be purchased as of the time of writing, but stock will fluctuate over time as Apple refreshes what is available, so you may need to check back often if you're looking for a specific color or capacity. Note that the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus is not available in Canada at the current time, but it will likely be added soon.<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced refurbished &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/apple-begins-selling-refurb-iphone-15-europe/">in Europe back in January</a>, but this is the first time Apple has offered discounted &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models in the U.S. since the devices came out in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Refurbished iPhones from Apple are unlocked and can be used with any carrier. Apple outfits all refurbished <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models with new batteries, outer shells, and a new USB-C cable, so they are essentially identical to new in the box iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Apple offers the same one-year warranty on refurbished &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, as well as the option to purchase extended <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ coverage.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/refurbished-iphone-15-us-store/">Refurbished iPhone 15 Models Now Available From Apple&#039;s Online Store in U.S. and Canada</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/refurbished-iphone-15-models-now-available-from-apples-online-store-in-u-s-and-canada.2456619/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 18.5 update that Apple plans to release next week will enable carrier-provided satellite features on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 13 models, adding satellite connectivity to iPhones that do not support Apple's built-in satellite functionality through Globalstar.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iPhone-13-Pro-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901694" /><br/>
Apple says that satellite connectivity provided by carriers will be enabled on all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 models, including the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 mini, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro Max. To use the feature, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 users will need cellular service that offers a satellite connectivity option, and there are several carriers that have been rolling out the functionality.<br/>
<br/>
In the United States, T-Mobile has partnered with SpaceX to provide customers with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/ios-18-3-starlink-t-mobile-support/">Starlink Direct service</a> for connecting to Starlink satellites when Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity are unavailable. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/apple-carrier-satellite-services-expansion/">au and One NZ</a> have also introduced satellite connectivity, as has Verizon, though <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/verizon-new-satellite-texting-feature/">Verizon's satellite option</a> does not currently work with &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has included built-in satellite connectivity in all iPhones dating back to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 lineup, with connectivity provided through a partnership with Globalstar. Satellite connectivity is useful in rural and remote areas where cellular towers are not available.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/ios-18-5-satellite-connectivity-iphone-13/">iOS 18.5 Brings Support for Carrier Satellite Connectivity to iPhone 13</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-5-brings-support-for-carrier-satellite-connectivity-to-iphone-13.2456614/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared release notes for iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5, ahead of the updates being released to the general public next week. The updates are minor overall, but they do include a useful change for the Screen Time feature on iPhones and iPads.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Screen-Time-iOS-16.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905106" /><br/>
Specifically, Apple says that parents will now receive a notification when their Screen Time passcode is successfully entered on their child's device.<br/>
<br/>
This change will allow parents to be alerted immediately if their child has correctly guessed or figured out the Screen Time passcode, which can allow the child to turn off or adjust the restrictions that were set by their parents.<br/>
<br/>
Parents will also receive these notifications on a Mac running macOS 15.5, which should be released to the general public next week.<br/>
<br/>
Screen Time launched in 2018 as part of iOS 12, providing parents with settings to remotely manage a child's device. For example, parents can restrict device usage to certain times, set time limits for apps, and block inappropriate content.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/screen-time/">Screen Time</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/ios-18-5-includes-a-useful-change-to-screen-time/">iOS 18.5 Includes a Useful Change to Screen Time</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-5-includes-a-useful-change-to-screen-time.2456613/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers can opt-in to the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.5 appears to be a minor update so far, and no notable new features were found in the first four betas. The release candidate version represents the final version of macOS 15.5 that will be released to the public next week as long as no issues come up during this last week of testing. <br/>
<br/>
Work on new features for &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; is winding down, as Apple will soon transition to macOS 16.

iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5 can be downloaded from the Settings app on a compatible device by going to General > Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
So far, iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-5-beta-features/">are relatively minor updates</a>, introducing just a few new design changes. There are more options for reverting the Mail app back to the prior design, including removing contact photos, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> info is easier to find. The update also likely has bug fixes and performance improvements that are less obvious, plus it will add new Pride wallpapers. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is transitioning to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> and iPadOS 19, which are set to be previewed in June at the Worldwide Developers Conference. iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5 are likely to launch next week. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/apple-seeds-ios-18-5-release-candidate/">Apple Seeds iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5 Release Candidates</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-ios-18-5-and-ipados-18-5-release-candidates.2456607/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In macOS, Apple allows you to share Tab Groups in Safari with colleagues, friends, and family. Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/safari-icon-blue-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833485" /><br/>
Introduced back in macOS Monterey, Tab Groups are designed to make organizing and preserving open tabs more manageable in Safari without having to have those tabs active.<br/>
<br/>
In a Tab Group, you can easily collect and save related tabs, which can be especially advantageous in scenarios where collaboration and coordination are key. For instance, teams working on research projects can compile relevant sources into a shared group, allowing everyone to stay aligned and contribute in real time. <br/>
<br/>
Families planning a vacation can gather booking sites, maps, and activity pages in one place, making it easy to explore options together. Even casual browsing, like curating gift ideas or event plans with friends, can benefit from this feature, turning scattered links into a centralized, living workspace. Here's how it's done.<br/>
<ol><li>To share a currently open Tab Group in Safari, reveal Safari's sidebar by clicking the <strong>Show sidebar</strong> button.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/share-safari-tab-groups1.jpg" alt="safari" width="1042" height="708" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000743" /><br/>
<li>Right-click the Tab Group or click the <strong>ellipsis button</strong> (three encircled dots) next to the Tab Group in the list and select <strong>Share Tab Group</strong> from the contextual menu. <br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/share-safari-tab-groups2.jpg" alt="safari" width="728" height="468" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000744" /><br/>
<li>Choose the desired sharing method from the Share Sheet menu that appears. Selecting Mail or Messages, for example, will open the associated app with a link to the Tab Group, ready to be sent.</li></ol>Once you've sent an invite, you can see who has access to the Tab Group by clicking the user profile icon that appears on the right-hand side of Safari's address bar. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/share-safari-tab-groups3.jpg" alt="safari" width="768" height="458" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000745" /><br/>
From there, you can manage access to the Tab Group: you can revoke access, add new people, or call and message them to chat about the project. Note that everyone you collaborate with must be signed in to their Apple Account, have Safari turned on in iCloud settings, and have two-factor authentication turned on.<br/>
<br/>
If you're on iPhone and iPad, here's how to share Tab Groups: Tap the open tabs button in the bottom-right corner of the screen (the two squares overlapping), then tap the Share icon (the square with the arrow pointing out). Tap Messages, then choose the person that you want to share the group with.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/">Safari</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/how-to-share-safari-tab-groups-in-macos/">How to Share Safari Tab Groups in macOS</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-share-safari-tab-groups-in-macos.2456604/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon has updated the Kindle app for iOS to include a new "Get Book" button that links users directly to purchase pages on Amazon's website, following a recent court ruling that prohibits Apple from blocking external purchase links or imposing a 27% commission on them (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661719/amazon-app-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-kindle-buy-books"><em>The Verge</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Amazon-Kindle-App-Get-Book-Feature-Emphasis.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1000733" /><br/>
The change to the Kindle app was made in response to a contempt order <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-anti-steering-injunction-violation/">issued on April 30, 2025</a>, by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the ongoing litigation between <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> and Apple. According to the court order, Apple is barred from continuing to enforce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules that previously prevented developers from directing users to external payment methods.<br/>
<br/>
For more than a decade, Kindle app users on Apple devices have been unable to purchase e-books directly through the app. Beginning in 2011, Apple began enforcing guidelines that required developers to either use Apple's in-app purchase system (incurring a 30% commission) or remove any links, buttons, or instructions that would guide users to alternative purchasing methods. As a result, the Kindle app became limited to browsing owned titles, downloading samples, or managing a wish list, while actual purchases had to be completed manually through Amazon.com in a browser.<br/>
<br/>
The update released this week introduces a prominent orange "Get Book" button next to book listings inside the Kindle app. When tapped, the button opens the user's default mobile web browser and navigates directly to the corresponding Amazon product page, with the Kindle edition of the book pre-selected. Users can then complete the purchase using Amazon's standard web-based checkout process. After the transaction, the book is automatically synced to the user's Kindle library and becomes available for immediate reading within the app. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the change in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>:<blockquote>We regularly make improvements to our apps to help ensure we are providing customers the most convenient experience possible. By selecting "Get Book" within the Kindle for iOS app, customers can now complete their purchase through their mobile web browser.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
This is the first time since the enforcement of Apple's in-app purchasing restrictions that Kindle users on iOS have had a direct route from the app to Amazon's store. Previously, the lack of in-app purchasing or even external linking meant users had to manually search for titles in a separate browser session.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple has filed an appeal against the court ruling, it is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-updates-u-s-app-review-guidelines-epic/">complying with the order</a>. The judge declined to stay the ruling during the appeals process, meaning companies are now able to implement new payment flows unless a higher court reverses the decision. In addition to Amazon, Spotify has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/02/spotify-out-of-app-payment-options/">announced similar changes</a>, and other developers are expected to follow.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kindle/">Kindle</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/kindle-app-gets-biggest-ios-change-in-a-decade/">Kindle App Gets Biggest iOS Change in Over a Decade</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kindle-app-gets-biggest-ios-change-in-over-a-decade.2456601/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the iPhone 18 Pro models are still around a year and a half away from launching, there are already several early rumors about the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-Top-Left-Hole-Punch-Face-ID-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000739" /><br/>
Below, we recap some key iPhone 18 Pro rumors, as of May 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Under-Screen Face ID</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/face-id.jpg" alt="" width="1023" height="573" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-966000" /><br/>
In April 2023, display industry analyst Ross Young shared a roadmap showing that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro models would feature under-display Face ID</a>. In May 2024, however, Young said he heard this change had been <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1786098652420911128">delayed until 2026</a>. If so, that means that under-screen Face ID could debut on the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max next year.<br/>
<br/>
Citing its own sources, <em>The Information</em> this month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">also reported</a> that the iPhone 18 Pro models will likely be equipped with under-screen Face ID.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Top-Left Front Camera</h2><br/>
With under-screen Face ID expected, the report from <em>The Information</em> said the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will have only a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">small pinhole in the top-left corner of the screen</a>, to accommodate the front-facing camera.<br/>
<br/>
The report said the devices will no longer have a pill-shaped cutout at the top of the screen, but it is unclear if the Dynamic Island will be discontinued.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Variable Aperture</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-design-cameras.jpg" alt="" width="923" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-966096" /><br/>
The main 48-megapixel Fusion camera on both iPhone 18 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/iphone-18-pro-rumored-camera-upgrade/">will offer variable aperture</a>, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
With variable aperture, users would be able to control the amount of light that passes through the camera's lens and reaches the sensor. The main cameras on iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro models have a fixed aperture of ƒ/1.78, and the lens is always fully open and shooting with this widest aperture. With the iPhone 18 Pro models, users would be able to manually change the aperture, according to this rumor.<br/>
<br/>
A variable aperture on iPhone 18 Pro models should provide users with greater control over depth of field, which refers to how sharp a subject appears in the foreground compared to the background. However, given that iPhones have smaller image sensors due to size restraints, it is unclear exactly how meaningful this improvement would be.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Samsung Image Sensor</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/iphone-12-pro-max-sensor-shift.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-771522" /><br/>
Samsung is developing a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-18-samsung-camera-sensor-report/">three-layer stacked camera sensor</a> that Apple is expected to use for iPhone 18 Pro models, according to <em>DigiTimes</em>. This advanced image sensor would make the iPhone 18's camera more responsive, and offer other benefits like reduced noise in photos, increased dynamic range, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The exact technology is called "PD-TR-Logic," according to a <a href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1874358213011005628">leaker known as "Jukanlosreve"</a>, and it refers to a camera sensor with three layers of circuitry affixed to it.<br/>
<br/>
Sony has long been the exclusive supplier of image sensors for iPhone cameras, so Samsung entering the fray would be notable.<br/>
<br/>
In July 2024, Kuo said he expected Samsung to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/2026-iphone-48mp-camera-sensor-samsung/">begin shipping 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera sensors to Apple</a> for iPhones as early as 2026, which is when the iPhone 18 Pro models are expected to be released.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>12GB of RAM</h2><br/>
iPhone 18 Pro models will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-12gb-ram-rumor/">equipped with 12GB of RAM</a>, according to Kuo. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/29/iphone-18-six-channel-memory-rumor/">Increased memory bandwidth</a> has also been rumored for the devices.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 16 Pro models are equipped with 8GB of RAM, while iPhone 17 Pro models and even the iPhone 17 Air are rumored to have 12GB of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>C2 Modem</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-c1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990815" /><br/>
Apple debuted its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">custom-designed C1 modem</a> in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> a few months ago, as part of a multi-year plan to transition away from Qualcomm modems.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's second-generation C2 modem will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-18-pro-c2-modem-rumor/">debut in the iPhone 18 Pro models</a> next year, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. Unsurprisingly, expect the C2 modem to be faster than the C1, and for it to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/">gain mmWave support</a> in the United States. Further power efficiency improvements are likely too.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>A20 Pro Chip (2nm)</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/a20-chip-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995953" /><br/>
Apple's A20 Pro chip for the iPhone 18 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/kuo-a20-chip-2nm/">will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process</a>, known as N2, according to Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's latest A18 and A18 Pro chips for the iPhone 16 series use TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, while the A19 and A19 Pro chips for the iPhone 17 series are expected to use TSMC's third-generation 3nm process.<br/>
<br/>
The move to a 2nm process starting with the A20 chips would allow for more transistors in each chip, which would boost performance. Specifically, reports indicate that A20 chips should be up to 15% faster and up to 30% more power efficient than A19 chips.<br/>
<br/>
An overview of current and expected chips:<ul><li>A17 Pro chip: 3nm (TSMC's first-generation 3nm process N3B)</li><br/>
<li>A18 and A18 Pro chips: 3nm (TSMC's second-generation 3nm process N3E)</li><br/>
<li>A19 and A19 Pro chips: 3nm (TSMC's third-generation 3nm process N3P)</li><br/>
<li>A20 and A20 Pro chips: 2nm (TSMC's first-generation 2nm process N2)</li></ul>Keep in mind that these nanometer sizes are simply TSMC marketing terms, rather than actual measurements.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/iphone-18-pro-seven-rumored-features/">iPhone 18 Pro Already Rumored to Have These Seven New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-already-rumored-to-have-these-seven-new-features.2456598/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
