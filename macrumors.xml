		<description><![CDATA[The Philips Hue line has long been focused on lighting products, but this year, Hue parent company Signify expanded the lineup with a set of Philips Hue Secure cameras and sensors designed for home security.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/hue-secure-camera-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908246" /><br/>
I was able to test out the &#36;200 Hue Secure Wired Camera to see how it measures up to some of the other smart camera options on the market. Hue's cameras can be used indoors or out, and the Hue Secure has 1080p video recording with night vision and motion trigger alerts, which at this point I'd expect from any security camera.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-design.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926641" /><br/>
The camera itself has a base that mounts to the wall with a screw, but if you want to sit it on a table or another flat surface, you need to pay an extra &#36;30 for the "Desktop" version. You can also buy the desktop stand after buying the camera, but it is &#36;50, which I feel is unreasonable for a plastic stand that should have come with the camera at no extra cost to begin with. I didn't want to use or test the camera mounted, so I did purchase the stand. You could probably rig something up, but the placement of the cord on the bottom of the camera prevents it from laying flat without the stand, and it's angled too high to use that way.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-front.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926642" /><br/>
To allow for interchangeable wall mounting and desktop use, magnets are used for base attachment. The magnets are super strong, so while the camera is meant to be mounted to the wall, I'm not worried that it's going to become detached. You can take it off the mount, and attach the mount to either the top or the bottom to optimize the view regardless of where you're mounting it. The field of view is wide enough that you're able to see an entire room if the camera is indoors, or a good section of your yard if it is outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-magnetic-components.jpg" alt="" width="4047" height="2276" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926644" /><br/>
The Hue Secure has a white plastic casing and a standard camera lens inside, and there is no mistaking it for a security camera. I was surprised at how long it is (a little over 3.5 inches), which means if you wall mount it, it's going to protrude a decent amount. The battery version of this camera is even longer in length at five inches, so it will protrude even further when mounted. I like the clean design and the magnetic attachment system, especially since the magnets allow it to be positioned in a range of ways that might not be possible with just a swivel mount.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-standard-base.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926645" /><em><div class="center-wrap">This is the standard base the camera comes with. The other base is one I purchased for &#36;50 to allow it to be placed on a desk.</div></em><br/>
The video quality was totally fine for a 1080p indoor/outdoor camera, and on par with the HomeKit-enabled cameras that I've tested. So, speaking of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, these don't have it. Those with a lot of Philips Hue lights know they all work with &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj;, but that is not the case with the cameras. No &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; support is likely going to be a dealbreaker for those in Apple's ecosystem who want everything to be controllable through a central app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-live-view.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="988" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926646" /><br/>
To use Hue Cameras, a Hue Bridge is required. The cameras don't ship with the Bridge, which costs &#36;60 if you don't have one already for Hue lights. I prefer smart home products that have a hub or a bridge like the Hue Bridge because it improves reliability. I never have setup issues or connectivity problems with my Hue lights, and the same is true for the Hue Secure Camera. It works and it works well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-cord.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926647" /><br/>
It was easy to add the camera to the app, and it can be viewed through the new Hue Secure section of the app. In my testing, it never once went offline, and it was a more reliable than the Eve <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/">HomeKit Secure Video</a> camera I have outside, which is off more than it is on and has been a total headache these last few months.<br/>
<br/>
I've had similar problems with other &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; cameras, and I just don't find them to be the most reliable option. Compared to Ring, though, I don't think Hue has much of an edge. My Ring cameras rarely go offline or have connectivity issues, so Hue is about on par.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-side-view.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926648" /><br/>
The cameras can be paired to Hue lights with automations to activate the lights when motion is detected, and they can sound alarms should there be an intruder. According to Signify, there is end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to keep video clips and snapshots private, along with software that helps prevent hacking. Video data is stored in the Hue Cloud if you opt for that, and content is deleted after 30 or 60 days. With E2EE, video and audio recordings cannot be viewed if the Hue Cloud were hacked because a multi-word auto-generated passcode you have is required. On that note, you need to keep the passcode somewhere safe, and you also need to hold on to the Hue Secure "Ownership Card" that's required for setup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-timeline.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1984" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926649" /><br/>
Like other smart cameras, the Hue Secure can recognize people, pets, and packages to send tailored alerts, and there are options to set up Activity and Package zones. There is a mimic presence function that can turn on Hue lights to make it seem like you're home when you're not, and the cameras support two-way talk so you can interface with someone if you need, but these are all functions that are available on other smart security cameras.<br/>
<br/>
Up to 10 cameras can be linked to a Hue Bridge, and a Hue account is required to use them. While the cameras can be used without a subscription, some of the functionality does require a monthly payment. Live streaming, video snapshots, light and sound alarms, and notifications are accessible for free.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-paid-plans.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926650" /><br/>
Recording requires a Basic or Plus plan, priced starting at &#36;39.99 per year after a 90-day trial period that comes with the purchase. Other paywalled features include Activity zone setup, and package/people alerts. The Basic plan supports two cameras, but if you have more cameras, you need the Plus plan that costs &#36;100/year. That basically puts the full cost of a Hue Camera at &#36;200 for the camera itself (not counting any accessories), &#36;60 for a Bridge (though these are sometimes on sale for less), and at least &#36;3.30 a month if you want to have a 30-day log.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-video-feed.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="988" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926651" /><br/>
If you wanted to use Hue Secure for a whole-home security system, you're looking at &#36;570 for a three-camera bundle (wired, not battery), and &#36;275 for a set of four contact sensors, two motion sensors, and a Bridge. Depending on how many doors and windows you have and what you want to protect, that may only cover a small home.<br/>
<br/>
I found the Hue Secure portion of the Hue app to be a bit confusing at first. I expected to have the option to see my camera feed right when opening the app, but I don't. I have to tap on the "Disarmed" or "Armed" feature under Security, then I have to tap on the feed under "Cameras." It then takes several seconds for the camera to connect to my <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> so that I can see my feed.<br/>
<br/>
The Hue Secure camera is not activated and set to recording unless the "Armed" option is enabled, so no alerts are received unless the camera is set to this state. The "Armed" feature can activate a siren or flash the lights when motion is detected, but by disabling everything, you can set it to Armed without having alarms and flashing lights going off if you simply want motion notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-night-vision.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="988" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926652" /><br/>
There are separate Armed activation options for when at home and when away, with the Hue app using geofencing for the away option to turn on the Armed mode automatically. If you "armed" the system and then it detected motion while you were away, you could set it to send a notification, flash the lights, and sound an alarm, hopefully scaring off any would-be intruders. When motion is detected, a 60 to 90 second video is captured, depending on subscription plan.<br/>
<br/>
Hue also has "Take Action" buttons for turning on the lights or sounding an alarm, and there are buttons for calling 911 or an emergency contact. The Armed and Not Armed features are nice for those who want a one-touch button that enables or disables all recording.<br/>
<br/>
At home, if you have the camera armed, you need to ensure that it and any linked motion sensors are not in areas where they could be accidentally triggered, because there is no specific person recognition or way for the camera to tell an intruder from someone who lives in the home. If you have lights set to activate or a siren on, a middle of the night bathroom break might accidentally set everything off. I have an open floor plan, so none of the main entries in my home are sectioned off enough that I could arm an indoor Hue Secure camera and not have to worry about triggering it myself.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-take-action.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1984" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926653" /><br/>
With a paid plan, the Hue Secure camera can tell a person from another event that triggers motion like an animal or a vehicle, but without it, it's all or nothing motion sensing. Setting boundaries for recording is also a paid feature, but there are blackout zones that can stop the camera from recording everything that's marked.<br/>
<br/>
When not armed, the camera is not recording, but the live view can be accessed. If you want to record, you need to make sure you put it into armed mode before you leave the house, and there is an automation for this so you don't need to remember to do it manually. There are options to delete all timeline events under the privacy section, and individual recordings can also be removed.<br/>
<br/>
From the layout of the app and the function of the camera, it's clear that Hue intends its system to be used for detecting and deterring intruders rather than something like keeping an eye on a pet or general home monitoring. The two-way talk works well, and the microphone quality is fine as long as there isn't a lot of ambient noise. I didn't have an issue being heard or understanding what was said on the camera.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-interface.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1984" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926654" /><br/>
I have a lot of Hue lights and also several security cameras, so I'm probably the kind of person that's the ideal target market for Hue's new camera options, but I'm struggling to find something new here to entice me to upgrade to the Hue Secure system at this price point.<br/>
<br/>
At a minimum, I'd like to be able to integrate these cameras into &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; so I can see the cameras in the Home app on the TV, Mac, and other devices. There isn't a Hue app on the Mac or on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> so while the Hue app itself does have a live feed of the camera, I can't view it on anything but an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. I also don't have options to use the cameras with my other non-Hue &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; lights and sensors.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
Given the number of &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; cameras on the market, I think the lack of &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; integration and the lack of &zwnj;HomeKit Secure Video&zwnj; support makes these a difficult sell to &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; users. And for people who don't care about &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; integration, the cost of these cameras makes it hard for them to compete with cheaper cameras with similar specs, such as those from Ring. The Ring Stick Up Cam with 1080p video recording and a battery is &#36;100, Hue's equivalent is &#36;250.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/hue-camera-front-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926655" /><br/>
There's already a lot of competition in the smart camera market, and it's tough to see where the Hue cameras quite fit in at this point given the limited integration and the price. The Hue cameras with included floodlights make the most sense because they serve a dual purpose as a light and as a camera, so those I could see investing in, but only if I was able to integrate them into &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The Hue Secure System would most appeal to someone who has Hue lights but few other smart home products and wants to stay entirely in a single platform.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released an iTunes 12.13.1 update for Windows users, with the software introducing security improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846163" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/itunes-for-windows.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
According to Apple's release notes, there are no notable new features, but the new version of iTunes should be installed as soon as possible because of the security improvements<br/>
<br/>
iTunes for Windows is typically updated every few months, and this update follows an October release that saw Apple add options for listening to podcasts and audiobooks.<br/>
<br/>
iTunes has been phased out on the Mac for several years now and it has been replaced with Finder and the TV app, but Apple has continued to keep the Windows version available.<br/>
<br/>
iTunes for Windows can be downloaded from the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/itunes/9PB2MZ1ZMB1S?hl=en-us&amp;gl=US">Microsoft Store</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210384">from Apple's website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/itunes/">iTunes</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-apps.2">Mac Apps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/itunes-for-windows-12-13-1/">Apple Releases iTunes for Windows 12.13.1 With Security Fixes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-itunes-for-windows-12-13-1-with-security-fixes.2413746/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 includes support for collaborative playlists in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, allowing &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscribers to build playlists with others. When creating a new playlist or selecting an existing playlist, there's a person-shaped icon that can be tapped to turn on collaboration.<br/>
<br/>
Enabling collaboration provides a link that can be shared with others, and anyone with the link is able to contribute to the playlist and listen to the songs. The person who started the playlist can choose to approve those who want to join or open it up to everyone. Anyone with the link to a playlist can add music, though the owner can turn off collaboration at any time or remove people.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 is expected to see a launch at some point in January 2024.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-1/">Apple Seeds First Public Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-public-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-3.2413743/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

You can also get the 15-inch 256GB M2 MacBook Air for <a href="https://howl.me/ckYxkzgComN"><strong>&#36;1,049.00</strong></a> at Best Buy right now, which is another record low price.<br/>
<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The MacBook Air is a cheaper, but still powerful, alternative to the MacBook Pro lineup. They're perfect for students or anyone who needs a reliable laptop for daily use, and powerful enough for anyone whose workflow isn't too demanding.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>13-inch M2 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Best Buy offers free next-day shipping as well as in-store pick-up for most locations, and has all four colors of the 13-inch MacBook Air at &#36;899.00. This is an all-time low price on the 13.6-inch 256GB M2 MacBook Air, and Best Buy has been one of the few retailers to offer this sale over the past few months. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ckQPZTZF5dZ"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>13.6-Inch MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;899.00</div></a></div><br/>

Best Buy also has the 512GB model of the 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air on sale, available for <a href="https://howl.me/ckQP5k7JDAC"><strong>&#36;1,199.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;,1399.00. Compared to past sales, this is a second-best price and still a solid discount on the 2022 notebook.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Overcome communication barriers with the new custom Translation option for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s Action button in iOS 17.2. Keep reading to learn how to use it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-translate.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918874" /><br/>
If you have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with an Action button, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, Apple's iOS 17.2 software update brings a new translation option for the button that allows you to translate live conversations into multiple languages. <br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, the translation is not just accurate but also context-aware, ensuring that nuances and colloquialisms are captured effectively. The feature should be a boon for travelers, students, and anyone learning a language. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-assign-two-shortcuts-action-button/">How to Assign Two Functions to the Action Button</a></li></ul><br/>
Before you use the Translate function, it's important to choose which language you want to translate. You can do this via Apple's built-in Translate app. On the app's main screen, use the chevrons next to the languages to make your selection. <br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/translate-choose-language.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925914" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Assign Translate to Action Button</h2><br/>
Once you have chosen your languages, you are ready to select the Translate option for the Action button.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap Action Button.</li><br/>
<li>Swipe to the Translate option to enable it.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/action-button-translate-setting.jpg" alt="settings" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925915" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Using the Translate Function</h2><br/>
To Translate your speech to your chosen language, simply press and hold the Action button on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and begin speaking. Keep holding down the button for as long as you want to capture speech.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-Button-Translate.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911022" /><br/>
Your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will transcribe what you said and display it in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, and it will also provide a translation in the chosen language just beneath the transcription. Your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will automatically read aloud the translation, and you can replay it by pressing the play button to the right of it.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-translate/">Apple Translate</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/action-button/">Action Button</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/translate-iphone-action-button/">iOS 17.2: How to Translate Speech With iPhone&#039;s Action Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-how-to-translate-speech-with-iphones-action-button.2413732/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<category>TSMC</category>
		<category>Apple Silicon</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[TSMC has officially mentioned its work on 1.4nm fabrication technology that is likely destined to underpin future Apple silicon chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-silicon-1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1422" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924673" /><br/>
In a slide (via <em>SemiAnalysis</em>'s <a href="https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1734766944774193291?s=20">Dylan Patel</a>) from its Future of Logic panel, TSMC disclosed the official name of its 1.4nm node for the first time, "A14." The company's 1.4nm technology is expected to follow its "N2" 2nm chips.<br/>
<br/>
N2 is scheduled for mass production in late 2025, to be followed by an enhanced "N2P" node in late 2026. As a result, it is unlikely that any A14 chips will arrive before 2027.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was the first company to utilize TSMC's 3nm technology with the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the company is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker's upcoming nodes. Apple's latest chip technology has historically appeared in the iPhone before making its way to the iPad and Mac lineups. With all of the latest information, here's how the iPhone's chip technology could look going forward:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>iPhone XR and XS (2018): A12 Bionic (7nm, N7)</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 11 lineup (2019): A13 Bionic (7nm, N7P)</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 12 lineup (2020): A14 Bionic (5nm, N5)</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 13 Pro (2021): A15 Bionic (5nm, N5P)</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro (2022): A16 Bionic (4nm, N4P)</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro (2023): A17 Pro (3nm, N3B)</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 16 Pro (2024): "A18" (3nm, N3E)</li></li><br/>
<li>"iPhone 17 Pro" (2025): "A19" (2nm, N2)</li><br/>
<li>"iPhone 18 Pro" (2026): "A20" (2nm, N2P)</li><br/>
<li>"iPhone 19 Pro" (2027): "A21" (1.4nm, A14)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The M1 series of Apple silicon chips is based on the A14 Bionic and uses TSMC's N5 node, while the M2 and M3 series use N5P and N3B, respectively. The Apple Watch's S4 and S5 chips use N7, the S6, S7, and S8 chips use N7P, and the latest S9 chip uses N4P.<br/>
<br/>
Each successive TSMC node surpasses its predecessor in terms of transistor density, performance, and efficiency. Earlier this week, it emerged that TSMC had already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology/">demonstrated prototype 2nm chips to Apple</a> ahead of their expected introduction in 2025.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/tsmc-mentions-highly-advanced-1-4nm-chips/">Apple Chipmaker Discusses Highly Advanced 1.4nm Chips for First Time</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-chipmaker-discusses-highly-advanced-1-4nm-chips-for-first-time.2413709/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple has improved its machine learning technology on iPhones in an effort to make iOS a lot more helpful, and one of the features in which this tech has been deployed is inline predictive text. <br/>
<br/>
Predictive text does just what it says - it predicts what you're going to type next, and offers to autocomplete it. As you type, the predicted text appears ahead of the cursor. If it has accurately predicted what you intend to type, all you need to do is tap the spacebar and iOS fills it in for you.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/how-to-disable-macos-inline-predictive-text/">How to Disable Inline Predictive Text on Mac</a></li></ul><br/>
In previous versions of iOS 17, you could only disable inline predictive text by turning off predictive text wholesale – which meant you would also lose the predicted words that appear above the keyboard as you type. Fortunately, in iOS 17.2 you can now toggle off inline predictive text separately without disabling the predictive suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Turning Off Inline Predictive Text</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Open Settings on your iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
<li>Under "All Keyboards," toggle off the switch next to Show Predictions Inline.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/disable-inline-predictive-text.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926320" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. The new option is likely to be welcomed by those who prefer a more manual typing experience or find inline predictive text suggestions distracting. Of course, if you find yourself missing the help that inline predictive text can provide, simply use the above steps to re-instate the feature.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/disable-iphone-inline-predictive-text/">iOS 17.2: How to Disable iPhone Inline Predictive Text</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-how-to-disable-iphone-inline-predictive-text.2413705/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Threads is now available to users in the European Union, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced. The move comes five months after the social media network launched in most markets around the world, but remained unavailable to EU-based users due to <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/no-instagram-threads-app-in-the-eu-irish-dpc-says-metas-new-twitter-rival-wont-be-launched-here/a1927220337.html">regulatory hurdles</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/instagram-threads-app.jpg" alt="" width="1079" height="607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902359" /><br/>
"Today we're opening Threads to more countries in Europe," wrote Zuckerberg in a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C01LXhDrCAM">post on the platform</a>. "Welcome everyone." In addition to creating a Threads profile for posting, users in the EU can also simply browse Threads without having an Instagram account, an option likely introduced to comply with legislation surrounding online services.<br/>
<br/>
The company's delay in launching the service in EU countries is believed to have been caused by the EU's Digital Markets Act, or DMA, which is intended to make the tech sector more open and balance competition. <br/>
<br/>
When Meta launched Threads in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/05/instagram-threads-app-now-available/">July</a>, users signed up through their Instagram account, which allowed Threads to gain millions of users. The integration between the two platforms wasn't universally welcomed though, and led to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/deleting-threads-profile-also-deletes-instagram/">complaints</a> that it was impossible to delete your Threads profile without also deleting your Instagram account. <br/>
<br/>
Then in November, Meta loosened the integration by rolling out a way to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/delete-threads-profile-keep-instagram-account/">delete or deactivate a Threads profile separately</a> while leaving the associated Instagram account intact.<br/>
<br/>
The expansion into a market of 448 million people should see Threads' user numbers get a decent boost. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a company earnings call in <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_earnings/2023/q3/transcript/META-Q3-2023-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">October</a> that Threads now has "just under" 100 million monthly users. Since its launch earlier this year it has gained a web app, an ability to search for posts, and a post editing feature.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/">Threads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/threads-launches-in-the-eu/">Threads Launches in the European Union</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-launches-in-the-european-union.2413701/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When Apple releases new software, iOS updates tend to get most of the attention, and there are sometimes useful new features in Mac updates that go under the radar. That's the case with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.2. It doesn't have flashy features like the Journal app that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-releases-ios-17-2-and-ipados-17-2/">came in iOS 17.2</a>, but there are a number of useful improvements that make it worth installing.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4cCFzlDjDM" title="macOS Sonoma 14.2 Out Now: Here&#39;s What&#39;s NEW!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
We've rounded up five of the best features that are included in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.2.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Messages</strong> - The Messages app includes a catch-up arrow that lets you jump to the first unread message in a conversation, plus there is an option to add a sticker to a message from the tapback interface. That makes it quicker to add non-emoji reactions during chats on the Mac.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>PDF AutoFill</strong> - AutoFill recognizes key fields in PDFs and other documents so you can fill them out quick. It will recognize addresses, phone numbers, and similar data that can be filled from the Contacts app.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Weather Widgets</strong> - There are several new Weather widgets that can be added to the Mac's desktop. Options include next-hour precipitation, daily forecast, sunrise and sunset, Air Quality, Feels Like, and wind speed.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Multiple Timer Support</strong> - The Clock app on the Mac supports multiple timers that are able to run simultaneously. There are also timer presets for quickly setting a timer.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Shazam Improvements</strong> - With a Shazam Music Recognition update, you can Shazam songs on Mac even when you're wearing your AirPods.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of iOS 17.2, Apple has outlined the Maps-related data that it is collecting in order to improve the augmented reality location function. In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213957">new support document</a>, Apple says that it is aiming to bolster the speed and accuracy of augmented reality features in the Maps app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-maps-3d-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="896" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-841030" /><br/>
When using augmented reality features in Maps, including immersive walking directions or the refine location option, Apple collects information on "feature points" that represent the shape and appearance of stationary objects like buildings. The data does not include photos or images, and the feature points collected are not readable by a person.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, Maps uses on-device machine learning to compare feature points to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> reference data that is sent to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The camera filters out moving objects like people and vehicles, with Apple collecting just the feature points of stationary objects.<br/>
<br/>
The comparison between the feature points and the &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; reference data allows Maps to pinpoint a user location and provide detailed walking directions with AR context. Using either the AR Walking directions or Refine Location refreshes Apple's reference data to improve augmented reality accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
Data that Apple collects is encrypted and not associated with an individual user or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>. Apple also uses on-device machine learning to add "noise" to the feature points data to add irregular variations that prevent any "unlikely" attempt to use feature points to reconstruct an image from the data.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, only an "extremely sophisticated attacker" that has access to the company's encoding system would be able to recreate an image from feature points, but because the data is encrypted and limited only to Apple, "an attack and recreation are extremely unlikely."<br/>
<br/>
The use of AR data can be disabled to prevent Apple from collecting it. The "Improve AR Location Accuracy" toggle can be accessed in the Settings app by going to Privacy and Security and then tapping on Analytics and Improvements.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/apple-maps-ar-data-collection/">Apple Collecting Data to Improve Augmented Reality Location Accuracy in Maps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-collecting-data-to-improve-augmented-reality-location-accuracy-in-maps.2413645/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17.3&#039;s Collaborative Apple Music Playlist Feature Includes Animated Emoji Reactions</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With the iOS 17.3 update, Apple reintroduced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-beta-apple-music-collaborative-playlists/">collaborative Apple Music playlist</a> feature, allowing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> users to build playlists with friends, family, and others who share their musical tastes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/apple-music-collaborative-playlist-emoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926541" /><br/>
For context, Apple initially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-beta-4-features/">tested collaborative playlists in iOS 17.2</a>, but ended up pulling the feature from the fourth beta prior to when iOS 17.2 was released. Apple said on Monday that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">would instead be launching in 2024</a>, and on Tuesday, collaborative playlists showed up in the iOS 17.3 beta.<br/>
<br/>
The new implementation allows all of the collaborators on a specific playlist to provide emoji reactions, similar to how tapback reactions work in Messages. To add an emoji reaction, play a collaborative playlist and then while a song is in progress, you can tap on the music player to see the emoji interface.<br/>
<br/>
There are standard emoji reactions to choose from like heart and thumbs up, but tapping on the "+" button allows you to choose from any of the available emoji options.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">iOS 17.3 Beta 1 adds Emojis reactions to Collaborative Playlists &#x203c;&#xfe0f;<br><br>Emoji Animations are insane &#x1f92a; <a href="https://t.co/RIQWYByfRE">pic.twitter.com/RIQWYByfRE</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Aubin (@kaubin) <a href="https://twitter.com/kaubin/status/1735005903630311449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
When you play a song that others have added emoji reactions to, you can see those emoji pop up from the emoji interface. Those who want to see collaborative &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; playlists and emoji reactions in action <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/pl.u-kaJH7JG97e?a=join&amp;it=zr6IZVEGZ6tVoblq">can join the MacRumors Apple Music playlist</a> to add songs and listen to content from other MacRumors readers.<br/>
<br/>
Collaborative playlists in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; are expected to be available to the public in January following the launch of iOS 17.3.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/ios-17-3-collaborative-playlist-emoji/">iOS 17.3&#039;s Collaborative Apple Music Playlist Feature Includes Animated Emoji Reactions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3s-collaborative-apple-music-playlist-feature-includes-animated-emoji-reactions.2413639/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While many iOS features are available internationally, some remain exclusive to the U.S., such as the Apple Card, Apple Card Savings, Apple Cash, Apple Pay Later, Wallet IDs, Roadside Assistance via Satellite, and Clean Energy Charging.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Apple-Logo-16x9-US-Flag-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926535" /><br/>
Below, we have provided more details about some iOS features available in the U.S. only.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Card</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/apple-card-1-iPhone-13.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818915" /><br/>
Launched in 2019, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> remains available in the U.S. only. Apple's credit card can be managed completely through the Wallet app on the iPhone, with a physical version available for use at stores that do not accept contactless payments. The card has no fees beyond interest and offers up to 3% cashback known as Daily Cash.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Card's financial partner in the U.S. is currently Goldman Sachs, but that reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">might change in the next 12 to 15 months</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While there have been clues that the Apple Card might expand to additional countries in the future, such as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/canada-approves-apple-card-apple-cash-trademarks/">Apple Card trademark filing in Canada</a>, Apple has not confirmed any immediate plans to launch the card internationally.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Apple Card Savings</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892213" /><br/>
Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">Apple Card savings account</a> launched in the Wallet app on the iPhone, allowing Apple Card holders in the U.S. to earn interest on their Daily Cash and other cash deposits. The high-yield savings account has a 4.15% APY, with no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements.<br/>
<br/>
Given the Apple Card is available in the U.S. only, so too is the savings account.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Cash</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-Cash-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-879664" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/#apple_cash">Apple Cash</a> is a Venmo-like payment feature that allows iPhone users in the U.S. to send, request, and receive money in the Wallet and Messages apps. Users can transfer their Apple Cash balance to a connected bank account.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Cash remains available in the U.S. only, and despite clues like a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/canada-approves-apple-card-apple-cash-trademarks/">trademark filing in Canada</a>, it is unclear if the feature will expand to other countries.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pay Later</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pay-Later-feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918417" /><br/>
Launched earlier this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-pay-later-launches/">Apple Pay Later</a> is a "buy now, pay later" feature that lets qualifying U.S. residents split a purchase made with Apple Pay into four equal payments over six weeks, with no interest or fees. The feature is available for purchases between &#36;75 and &#36;1,000 made on an iPhone or iPad on most websites and apps that accept Apple Pay.<br/>
<br/>
Like the other financial features on this list, it is unclear if or when Apple Pay Later will expand to other countries.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wallet IDs</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/apple-wallet-drivers-license-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1698" height="956" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813979" /><br/>
In 2022, Apple started letting residents of participating U.S. states add their driver's license or state ID to the Wallet app on the iPhone and Apple Watch, providing a convenient and contactless way to display proof of identity or age. The feature is currently available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/23/apple-launches-ids-in-wallet-arizona/">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/colorado-ids-wallet-app-support/">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/25/iphone-drivers-license-wallet-app-maryland/">Maryland</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/iphone-drivers-license-georgia/">Georgia</a> only, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/iphone-ids-coming-to-these-8-us-states/">additional states to follow</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said it was working to offer the ID feature across the U.S. in the future, but the company has yet to announce any specific plans or a timeframe, and it has not indicated if the feature will ever launch in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Roadside Assistance via Satellite</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-roadside-assistance.jpg" alt="" width="1596" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910510" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 17, all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models offer a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-roadside-assistance-feature-tested/">roadside assistance via satellite feature</a> that allows users in the U.S. to contact roadside assistance company AAA for vehicle service when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said the feature is available "beginning" in the U.S., so it will likely expand to some additional countries in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Clean Energy Charging</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/clean-energy-charging-ios-16-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-864277" /><br/>
iOS 16.1 introduced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/24/ios-16-1-clean-energy-charging-details/">Clean Energy Charging feature</a> that "aims to decrease the carbon footprint of the iPhone by optimizing charging times for when the grid is using cleaner energy sources," according to Apple. When the feature is toggled on, the iPhone will attempt to charge "when lower carbon-emission electricity is available."<br/>
<br/>
Clean Energy Charging is available in the U.S. only, and Apple has not indicated if or when it will be expanded to additional countries.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/ios-features-in-us-only/">These Seven iOS Features Remain Available in the U.S. Only</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-seven-ios-features-remain-available-in-the-u-s-only.2413635/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began selling a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 Case on a standalone basis, allowing customers who own the Lightning charging case to upgrade to USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914627" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/airpods-pro-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The standalone USB-C &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; Case is priced at &#36;99 <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUYG3AM/A/magsafe-charging-case-usb%E2%80%91c-for-airpods-pro-2nd-generation">from Apple's online store</a>, and the listing was first noticed by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/24000010/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-case-now-available">The Verge</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
Orders placed today for the USB-C charging case will deliver to customers between December 27 and January 2, which is after the Christmas holiday.<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced a new version of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 with USB-C Charging Case in September, but at the time, there was no option to buy a USB-C case on its own. Customers with the Lightning-based &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 had no upgrade path, but those who want to have USB-C charging across all of their devices can now pay a &#36;99 fee to get the new version.<br/>
<br/>
The USB-C Charging Case is compatible with the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. It continues to offer &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging as well, just like the Lightning model.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to a USB-C port, the USB-C Charging Case also provides improved IP54 dust resistance, but it will not add lossless audio for the Vision Pro, which is a feature added to the updated &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 that come with the USB-C Charging Case. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/apple-selling-standalone-usb-c-airpods-pro-case/">Apple Now Selling Standalone USB-C AirPods Pro Case for &#36;99</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-standalone-usb-c-airpods-pro-case-for-99.2413617/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple might soon face a setback in its EU antitrust battle with Spotify, which filed a complaint against the iPhone maker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/">over four years ago</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-vs-Spotify-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801789" /><br/>
EU regulators are planning to force Apple to allow competing music services like Spotify to direct users to payment methods other than the App Store's in-app purchase system within their apps, or face a fine of as much as 10% of its annual sales, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-13/apple-set-to-be-hit-by-eu-antitrust-order-in-app-store-fight-with-spotify">Bloomberg</a></em>. The decision is slated to be announced in early 2024, the report says.<br/>
<br/>
Apple currently prevents apps from letting users know about a purchasing method other than the App Store's in-app purchase system within their apps, although it does allow developers to inform customers by email. If and when the EU's order takes effect, Apple would be required to drop this so-called "anti-steering" rule. It's unclear if Spotify will be allowed to accept payments directly within its app, or merely advertise other payment methods.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify has been unwilling to let customers subscribe to its streaming music service for its usual price of &#36;10.99 per month within its iPhone app, as it would receive less due to Apple's 15% to 30% commission on in-app purchases. Spotify has argued that being unable to let iPhone users know about other payment options is anticompetitive.<br/>
<br/>
We will update this story if Apple responds to the report.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/eu-plans-to-end-apple-anti-steering-rule/">EU Plans to Let Spotify Direct Users to Other Payment Options on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-plans-to-let-spotify-direct-users-to-other-payment-options-on-iphone.2413613/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google, Meta, Qualcomm, Nothing, Lenovo, Opera and several other tech companies have announced a collaborative effort to push for "open digital ecosystems" in what appears to be a pointed move against Apple (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-meta-qualcomm-team-up-push-open-digital-ecosystems-2023-12-13/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-837104" /><br/>
The group, calling itself the Coalition for Open Digital Ecosystems (CODE), seeks to encourage more open platforms and systems in Europe. Other members include Motorola, Chinese smartphone brand Honor, French augmented reality start-up Lynx, and German messaging service provider Wire. Apple is noticeably absent from the organization's members.<br/>
<br/>
CODE's formation comes in response to new EU rules such as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which designates major tech companies as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">gatekeepers</a>" and compels them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. The DMA is expected to force Apple to make significant changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> work in Europe. For example, Apple will next year be obliged to allow users to install third-party app stores and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/">sideload apps</a>, as well as give developers the ability to promote their offers outside the ‌‌‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌‌‌ and use third-party payment systems.<br/>
<br/>
CODE plans to work with companies, legislators, and academics to promote digital openness and present pathways for this to be achieved in Europe using the DMA and future EU legislation. Members have discussed how digital ecosystems should work in Europe and what positively impacts competitiveness and openness. The organisation aims to open up major digital ecosystems using cross-industry collaboration to promote seamless connectivity and interoperability between systems.<br/>
<br/>
While the likes of Google and Meta have been officially designated as gatekeepers by the EU just like Apple, rivals are increasingly attempting to use EU law to prompt major changes to Apple's ecosystem. For example, last month, Google and European telecom groups <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/google-asks-eu-to-force-open-imessage/">urged EU regulators</a> to designate iMessage a "core" service that would force Apple to make the communications platform interoperable with competing chat services.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/motorola/">Motorola</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lenovo/">Lenovo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/opera-browser/">Opera Browser</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nothing/">Nothing</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/apple-rivals-unite-to-promote-open-ecosystems/">Apple Rivals Unite to Promote Open Ecosystems Using EU Law</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rivals-unite-to-promote-open-ecosystems-using-eu-law.2413595/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17.2, Apple lets you customize the alert tone used by your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> for default notifications. This is good news for anyone who does not like the "Rebound" tone that Apple introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" /><br/>
In previous versions of iOS, Apple allowed users to choose a ring tone and a text tone, as well as custom alert sounds for email, calendar, and reminder alerts. Anything else that threw up notifications used a default sound, and there was no way to change it.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Apple then changed the original default alert sound, from "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYHdfDJrwMU">Tri-tone</a>" to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjveF8Vtw6c">Rebound</a>." Many users disliked the change, with some arguing that the new sound is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/737407">harder to hear</a>. So the new ability in iOS 17.2 to change the default sound to whatever you like should come as welcome news.<br/>
<br/>
To change the tone - as well as the haptic vibration – of notifications from apps that use the default sound, follow these steps.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap Sounds & Haptics.</li><br/>
<li>Select Default Alerts.</li><br/>
<li>Choose a sound for the alert tone. You can use one from Apple's built-in options, buy a tone from the Tone Store, or opt for no sound (None) instead.</li><br/>
<li>To change the accompanying haptic vibration, tap through to Haptics. There you can choose a vibration from the pre-set options, make your own via Create New Vibration, or opt for None.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/default-notification-sound.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926296" /><br/>
<br/>
After completing the steps above, any notification sound that uses the default alert tone will use the sound you selected. If you're not happy with your changes, you can use the same steps to revert to the original "Rebound" default alert.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/change-iphone-default-notification-sound/">iOS 17.2: How to Change Your iPhone&#039;s Default Notification Sound</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-how-to-change-your-iphones-default-notification-sound.2413591/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/apple-expands-self-service-repair-and-introduces-new-diagnostics-process/">announced</a> it has expanded its Self Service Repair program to cover the iPhone 15 lineup and Mac models powered by M2 chips, including the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, the 15-inch MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Pro, and Mac Studio. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Self-Service-Repair-Program-iPhone.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895789" /><br/>
Apple also said that Self Service Repair is now available for Apple users in 24 additional European countries, including Croatia, Denmark, Greece, Netherlands, Portugal, and Switzerland. With this latest expansion, Self Service Repair now supports 35 Apple products in 33 countries and 24 languages.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Apple Diagnostics for Self Service Repair is available today in the U.S. for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/101965">iPhones</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102488">Macs</a>, with availability in Europe to come next year. Intended for users with the knowledge and expertise to repair Apple devices, Apple Diagnostics troubleshooting sessions gives customers the same ability as Apple Authorized Service Providers and Independent Repair Providers to test devices for optimal part functionality and performance, as well as identify which parts may need repair.<br/>
<br/>
Launched in 2022, Apple's Self Service Repair program is designed to allow Apple device owners to do their own repairs in their homes using Apple parts, repair manuals, and tools.<br/>
<br/>
To conduct a repair, customers first need to review the repair manual for their product and the specific repair on Apple's support website. After, they'll be able to order the required parts and tools from the Self Service Repair Store and begin the repair. <br/>
<br/>
The program is part of Apple's efforts to "further expand access to repairs," according to the company. That said, Apple cautions that the "vast majority" of customers should still visit a professional repair provider, such as an Apple Store, to ensure their devices are repaired safely and reliably. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/">Self Service Repair</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/apple-expands-self-service-repair-iphone-15/">Apple Expands Self Service Repair in Europe, Now Covers iPhone 15 and M2 Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expands-self-service-repair-in-europe-now-covers-iphone-15-and-m2-macs.2413590/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, Apple introduced design changes like a curved frame and a frosted glass back. Information acquired by <em>MacRumors</em> suggests that Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> will build on these updates with modifications to the buttons and the camera layout.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Mock-Back-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925836" /><br/>
We have details on early pre-production designs for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, including a look at the variants and hardware configurations that Apple has considered so far. Our information comes early in the design process, but it provides an indication of what we can expect from the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, or DeLorean as Apple engineers refer to it internally. <br/>
<br/>
We've included mockups of what the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; could look like based on Apple's internal designs, down to the exact colors the company is using for testing. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> rendered in yellow features the earliest known button design with an Action Button, unified volume button, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X-style camera bump. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in pink has an Action Button and separate mechanical volume buttons, while the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in midnight has the larger Action button and new Capture button. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; rendered in black is the design we are expecting at this point.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; design process, Apple has prototyped multiple hardware configurations. While these look similar at first glance, there are a number of differences between them. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Mock-Cameras-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925734" /><br/>
The most obvious and visually distinct change is a new vertical camera arrangement. Unlike its predecessor, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will have vertically aligned rear cameras, making the phone easily recognizable as the latest model. While the vertical alignment of the rear cameras has so far remained constant throughout different development stages, Apple is considering two different camera bump designs: <br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12-style design, with two camera lenses located one above the other</li><br/>
<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X-type design, with a singular pill-shaped enclosure</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Relative to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, the location of the flash is the same with both designs, which suggests that Apple does not plan to change the position of the flash. While both designs have been considered, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12-like camera layout with two distinct lenses has been used more extensively on Apple's prototype units. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Mock-Left.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925735" /><br/>
The earliest known prototypes of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; included a unified volume button that was developed as part of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-haptic-button-overview/">now-canceled Bongo project</a> originally intended for release with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. The unified button would have provided users with haptic feedback, but it was scrapped earlier this year following unresolved technical issues. After the cancelation of the Bongo project, Apple moved back to mechanical buttons for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The Action button is another carry-over from the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. That we're seeing the Action button this early on suggests Apple last year had decided to phase out the mute switch, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">plans to standardize the Action button across the entire iPhone 16 range</a>. The size of the Action Button has varied across different configurations. Some designs and prototypes feature a significantly larger Action Button, which was created as part of Project Atlas in an effort to change the Action Button from mechanical to capacitive, while some have the same button that's on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. Signs point to a capacitive Action Button at this time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Mock-Right.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925736" /><br/>
Apple is also experimenting with a new button on the right side of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. As <em>MacRumors</em> revealed back in September, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; is expected to include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">an all-new capacitive Capture Button</a>, developed internally under the codename Project Nova. Information from our sources suggests that this button will feature a force sensor in addition to  "tact-switching" functionality, although it is still unclear what the latter entails. The Capture Button is located in the same spot as the mmWave cutout on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models sold in the United States, so with the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, the mmWave antenna has been moved to the left side of the device.<br/>
<br/>
While it looks like we're getting a new button, Apple has developed an alternate hardware configuration that does not feature a Capture Button, which it could revert to if there are hardware issues during the button's development.<br/>

The front of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; does not feature any noticeable changes, and it continues to use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>. The base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; is expected to feature a display similar to the one used on its predecessor, with no major differences. As with the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; has a USB-C port at the bottom of the device.<br/>
<br/>
As far as colors are concerned, early prototypes have been seen in three colors: yellow, pink and midnight, while documentation suggests that other color options initially developed for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; were also used for testing at one point.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up, though the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; won't have notable changes to its chassis, it will have the following key updates:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Vertical camera arrangement, likely similar to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12</li><br/>
<li>New capacitive Capture Button</li><br/>
<li>Capacitive Action Button</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The information presented here accurately portrays and describes early designs of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but the existence of multiple hardware configurations suggests that Apple's design plans have not yet been finalized. The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; is still far from release, and additional changes are always possible.<br/>
