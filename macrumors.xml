<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1791627895124939268">reports</a> that Apple will soon boost the credit paid for older iPhones when customers buy an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
The offer does not apply to other devices in Apple's smartphone lineup, including the iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone SE (4th generation). <br/>
<br/>
Gurman did not mention the new values of old iPhones in its trade-in program, only that they will increase as of Monday, May 20, with the offer continuing through to Monday, June 3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple currently offers the following credit values for older iPhones as part of its trade-in program:<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>iPhone SE (3rd generation): Up to &#36;160</li><br/>
    <li>iPhone 13 mini: Up to &#36;270</li><br/>
    <li>iPhone 13: Up to &#36;300</li><br/>

    <li>iPhone 14 Pro: Up to &#36;520</li><br/>
    <li>iPhone 14 Pro Max: Up to &#36;630</li><br/>
</ul>Trade-ins can be completed on Apple's website or at an Apple Store, and the credit can be applied towards the purchase of a new Apple product, or placed on an Apple gift card for later use.

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025"><em>The Information</em></a> today reported that Apple plans to release an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slimmer-iphone-17-major-redesign-rumor/">all-new, high-end iPhone 17 model</a> next year, and there was one detail that is worth singling out: the rear cameras could be relocated to the "top center" of the device.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Google-Pixel-8-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951444" /><em>Google's Pixel 8 Pro</em></div><br/>
The rear camera system on the iPhone has been positioned in the top-left corner of the device since the original 2007 model, so the cameras being moved to the top center of the device would be a notable change. Some popular Android smartphones have rear cameras positioned towards the top center, such as Google's Pixel 8 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The report said the new iPhone 17 model will feature a "major redesign" akin to the iPhone X, so it sounds like Apple has big plans for this device. With the report claiming the device could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which starts at &#36;1,199, perhaps it will end up being the "iPhone Ultra" that has been rumored for a few years.<br/>
<br/>
Here is everything that the report mentioned about the slimmer iPhone 17:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Between a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">likely 6.5-inch</a>)</li><br/>
<li>A "significantly thinner" design with an aluminum frame</li><br/>
<li>Rear cameras moved to "top center" of device</li><br/>
<li>A higher price tag than the Pro Max model in the iPhone lineup</li><br/>
<li>Improved front camera</li><br/>
<li>A narrower Dynamic Island</li><br/>
<li>A19 chip</li></ul><br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today published its second annual <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Transparency Report [<a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2023-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf">PDF</a>], highlighting details like the number of apps that were rejected during the year, the number of customer and developer accounts deactivated, the number of apps removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Sqaure-Complement.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833993" /><br/>
In 2023, there were 1,870,119 total apps available, and Apple reviewed 6,892,500 app submissions. 1,763,812 apps were rejected, with performance, design, and legal listed as the top reasons why an app wasn't approved. 277,923 apps were approved after rejection following changes made to the app.<br/>
<br/>
116,117 apps were removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and top categories for removal included Utilities, Games, and Business. 76,887 apps were removed for violating Guideline 4.0 on design, and 35,245 apps were removed for violating &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules preventing fraud.<br/>
<br/>
Apple removed 1,285 apps at the request of the Chinese government, and 103 at the request of the South Korean government. Apps were also pulled in India, Russia, Indonesia, Lithuania, Ukraine, and several other countries at the request of their respective governments.<br/>
<br/>
398,499,012 customer accounts search the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; on average on a weekly basis, and 166,360 apps appear in the top 10 results of at least 1000 searches each week. As Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/apple-fraud-prevention-analysis-2024/">said earlier this week</a>, it terminated 373,739,771 customer accounts and prevented an estimated &#36;1,838,127,451 in fraudulent transactions.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been over two years since Apple released the third-generation iPhone SE, and rumors continue to surface about a new model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
The latest word comes <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025">from <em>The Information</em></a>, which today reported that Apple plans to release a new iPhone SE with a design similar to the standard iPhone 14 in the spring of 2025. If this rumor is accurate, the iPhone SE would finally gain Face ID and a notch instead of Touch ID and a Home button, along with a larger 6.1-inch display. Other rumored features for the next iPhone SE <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/">include a USB-C port and an Action button</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The report said the new iPhone SE will remain a "cheaper" option in the iPhone lineup, as expected. The current iPhone SE starts at &#36;429 in the U.S. with 64GB of storage, with other key features including a 4.7-inch display, A15 Bionic chip, 5G support, a single 12-megapixel rear camera, and a Lightning port.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The developers behind the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-emulator-hands-on/">Game Boy emulator Delta for the iPhone</a> said they updated the app's icon today to avoid potential legal action from Adobe.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Delta-App-Icon-Update-Adobe-AEM-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951476" /><em>Delta's new app icon (left) and Adobe's logo (right)</em></div><br/>
"Adobe threatened legal action unless we changed our app icon — so we did," say the release notes for the latest version of Delta <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">on the App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Delta's former icon does look like a mirrored version of Adobe's logo, which is a registered trademark in the U.S. and other countries. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, companies have an obligation to enforce their trademarks, and failure to do so could eventually result in losing rights to the trademark.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Delta-Old-Icon.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951480" /><em>Delta's previous app icon</em></div><br/>
"Without proper policing over time, the original owner of a mark could lose any trademark rights it has in the mark," the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/BasicFacts_1.pdf">says</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has enforced its trademarked logo in similar ways over the years, including in 2020, when it filed a complaint against a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/08/legal-action-against-company-with-pear-logo/">small company with a pear logo</a>.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A bug in iOS 17.5 is apparently causing photos that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-17-5-bug-deleted-photos-reappear/">have been deleted to reappear</a>, and the issue seems to impact even iPhones and iPads that have been erased and sold off to other people.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Green-and-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940351" /><br/>
A Reddit user wiped an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> following Apple's guidelines in September of 2023 before selling it off to a friend. That friend updated the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to iPadOS 17.5 this week, and began seeing the Reddit user's old photos reappearing in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1cspwh2/my_old_photos_appeared_on_an_ipad_i_sold/">From Reddit</a>:<blockquote>I wiped the iPad using official Apple guides before selling. I never logged into that iPad with my Apple ID after erasing the iPad. I sold my iPad to a friend in September 2023, they called me today after updating to iPad OS 17.5 and said my old pictures appeared in their Photos app... HUGE PRIVACY VIOLATION. I see other reports of this. How many people will get other people's photos on the devices they bought from other people?</blockquote>The impacted &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; was a fourth-generation 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> that had been updated to the latest operating system update, and before it was sold, it was erased <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/109511">per Apple's instructions</a>. The Reddit user says they did not log back in to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; at any point after erasing it, so it is entirely unclear how their old photos ended up reappearing on the device.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, we shared several other reports of users who saw <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-17-5-bug-deleted-photos-reappear/">deleted photos resurfacing</a> on their devices after updating, but those reports were from users who still owned their devices and were logged into their own <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Photo Libraries and Apple IDs.<br/>
<br/>
The latest report suggests that the erased and sold &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is somehow restoring old photos from an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> that is no longer signed in to it. The Reddit user says the photos that are reappearing are from 2017, which is in line with similar reports. The images were initially taken on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and so had been synced to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-photo-library/">iCloud Photo Library</a> before the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; was wiped and sold.<br/>
<br/>
Other users have seen photos from years ago (as late as 2010) reappearing suddenly, with no explanation for why. Not all users are seeing this problem, nor does it appear to be impacting all deleted images.<br/>
<br/>
Apple devices are supposed to retain photos for 30 days in the Recently Deleted section of the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app, and images should be deleted automatically if a second delete procedure is carried out from the Recently Deleted interface. Apple has not yet provided any information on why some users may be seeing photos reappearing, and it is concerning to hear of a report of old photos showing up on a device that was wiped and sold.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/ios-17-5-bug-wiped-devices-photos-resurfacing/">iOS 17.5 Bug May Also Resurface Deleted Photos on Wiped, Sold Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-5-bug-may-also-resurface-deleted-photos-on-wiped-sold-devices.2426698/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week came out with new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has a next-generation M4 chip and an OLED display so it got much of the attention, but Apple added a whole new size to the Air lineup to offer a more affordable way to get a bigger screen. We spent some time with the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to see what's new and whether it's worth buying.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="13" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J12xb7kQseo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The smaller version of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; measures in at 11 inches, and the larger version is 13 inches, the same as the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Prior to now, the only way to get a 13-inch tablet was to buy the Pro, but the new Air is a much more affordable option.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing starts at &#36;599 for the 11-inch version and &#36;799 for the 13-inch version, while the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;999 and the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is &#36;1,299. So the 13-inch Air is a full &#36;500 cheaper. You're losing out on the OLED display, ProMotion, compatibility with the new Magic Keyboard, and the M4 chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-air-vs-ipad-pro/">but not too much else</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip in the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is still super fast and able to handle anything you might want to do on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and while the display doesn't have the brightness or the contrast of the OLED display, it's good enough for almost everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Confusingly, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; "Air" name no longer really fits because the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are now thinner and lighter than the Air models, so you can also expect a little bit of extra bulk going with the Air line. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; can only be used with the prior-generation Magic Keyboard, but it does work with the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro that has haptic feedback and a gyroscope for barrel roll.<br/>
<br/>
At &#36;799, the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; paired with a keyboard is probably the best &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for those who want a computer replacement, given its size, speed, and price point. The 11-inch model is ideal if you want something smaller and more affordable that's still powerful, but for those who just want a simple tablet for watching movies or browsing the web, even the Air might be too much tablet.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to launch an all-new iPhone 17 model next year with a "significantly thinner" design, according <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025">to <em>The Information</em></a>. The report says the device could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which currently starts at &#36;1,199, suggesting that the device would become the new highest-end model in the lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911423" /><br/>
The device will allegedly feature a "major redesign" akin to the iPhone X, and this could involve the rear cameras being relocated from the top-left corner of the device to the "top center," along with a narrower Dynamic Island. The device will have between a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display size, the report adds. Other potential features mentioned include an aluminum chassis, an A19 chip, and an improved front camera.<br/>
<br/>
As part of this plan, the report says that Apple does not plan to release an iPhone 17 Plus next year, so the lineup would still consist of four models.<br/>
<br/>
This is the third time that a slimmer iPhone 17 model has been rumored this month, following reports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">from Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu</a> and display industry expert Ross Young, who said the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">will have a 6.5-inch screen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The report cautions that Apple is still testing multiple designs for this new iPhone, and potential delays could push the device's release beyond 2025.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slimmer-iphone-17-major-redesign-rumor/">iPhone 17 Lineup Rumored to Feature All-New Slim Model Above Pro Max With &#039;Major Redesign&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-lineup-rumored-to-feature-all-new-slim-model-above-pro-max-with-major-redesign.2426680/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the past few days, some iPhone users have said the "Allow Apps to Request to Track" toggle in the Settings app is suddenly grayed out on their devices. The issue was <a href="https://x.com/iDeviceHelpus/status/1791298492004188306">highlighted by @iDeviceHelpus on X</a>, and in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1cthk6t/allow_apps_to_request_to_track_setting_is_greyed/">post on Reddit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Allow-Apps-to-Request-to-Track-Grayed-Out-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951383" /><br/>
Apple's fine print below the grayed-out toggle says "this setting cannot be changed because a profile is restricting it, or because your Apple ID is being managed, does not meet the minimum age requirements, or is missing age information." However, many affected users say none of these reasons actually apply to them.<br/>
<br/>
While some affected users said the issue began after they updated their iPhones to iOS 17.5, released earlier this week, others said they are also impacted on older software versions, including iOS 17.4.1, iOS 17.4, and iOS 16.6. The root cause of the problem is unclear. We have reached out to Apple for comment.<br/>
<br/>
With multiple iOS versions affected, and some users saying the problem eventually resolved itself, it is likely this is a server-side issue.<br/>
<br/>
Located in the Settings app under Privacy & Security → Tracking, the "Allow Apps to Request to Track" setting normally allows apps to ask to track your activity across other apps and websites when it is turned on. When the setting is turned off, all new app tracking requests are automatically denied. The setting is part of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/">App Tracking Transparency</a> feature, introduced with iOS 14.5 around three years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> Apple says it has fixed an issue that may have briefly disabled the "Allow Apps to Request to Track" setting for some iPhone users on iOS 14 and above. All affected users will see their previously-selected settings be restored over the next few days. Users who were impacted by the bug were defaulted to the most privacy-preserving state.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/">App Tracking Transparency</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/iphone-app-tracking-toggle-grayed-out-issue/">Some iPhone Users Say &#039;Allow Apps to Request to Track&#039; Toggle is Suddenly Grayed Out [Fixed]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-iphone-users-say-allow-apps-to-request-to-track-toggle-is-suddenly-grayed-out-fixed.2426681/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users are familiar with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-photos/">Live Photos</a>, which capture 1.5 seconds of video before and after you take a picture, with the aim of adding a little bit of life and movement to still images. What some users might not know is that you can also make a Live Photo bounce back and forth like a boomerang.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg" alt="" width="836" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897381" /><br/>
If you're familiar with Instagram, you probably know what a boomerang is. Since introducing &zwnj;Live Photos&zwnj; in 2015, Apple has added some effects to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app that let you turn them into fun animated clips, and the Bounce effect is basically the same thing as a boomerang. It rewinds the action backward and forward. Here's how to make one of your own on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app and select a Live Photo. (If you look under "Media Types" in the <strong>Albums</strong> section, you'll find all of your &zwnj;Live Photos&zwnj; collated in a folder of the same name.)</li><br/>
<li>With the Live Photo open, tap the <strong>LIVE</strong> icon in the top-left corner of the interface.</li><br/>
<li>From the dropdown menu that appears, choose <strong>Bounce</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/boomerang-live-photos-1.jpg" alt="Live Photos" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951332" /><br/>
<br/>
The effect you choose will be applied immediately, ready for you to share it using the Share icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Note that there are two other effects that you can try in &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;: Loop repeats the action in a continuous looping video, and Long Exposure simulates a DSLR-like long exposure effect by blurring motion.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that it you get a blurry Live Photo image, you can open it up and see if other frames you captured are clearer, and then <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/make-a-new-key-photo-in-live-photos/">select a replacement "key photo" for it</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube channel Phone Repair Guru has shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvW-I8EczZ4">teardown video</a> for the new 13-inch iPad Pro with the M4 chip, providing a first look at the device's internal design changes.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/2024-iPad-Pro-Teardown.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="887" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951313" /><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvW-I8EczZ4">Phone Repair Guru</a> tears down the new iPad Pro</em></div><br/>
During its iPad event last week, Apple said it was able to improve the thermal performance of the new iPad Pro models by nearly 20% compared to the previous-generation models by adding graphite sheets to the chassis and infusing the rear Apple logo with copper. These changes can be seen towards the end of the teardown video.<br/>
<br/>
Apple moved the front camera and Face ID components to the iPad Pro's right-side edge, which is where the new Apple Pencil Pro magnetically attaches to the device. The teardown shows some changes to the array of magnets inside the iPad Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HvW-I8EczZ4?si=80b7dlfOM4x0iold" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Overall, the new iPad Pro has a similar internal design as the previous generation. The video provides a look at the central logic board with the M4 chip, a 10,209 mAh battery with adhesive pull tabs, quad speakers, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Repair website iFixit will likely share a more in-depth teardown of the new iPad Pro soon.<br/>
<br/>
The new iPad Pro launched in stores and began arriving to customers on Wednesday. In addition to the M4 chip and the relocated front camera, key new features include a brighter OLED display and thinner design compared to the previous generation.

		<title>Testing of iOS Browsers With Third-Party Engines Geofenced to EU</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Developers who want to develop browsers for iOS with third-party engines can only test their apps on devices physically located in the EU, according to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/17/apple_browser_eu/"><em>The Register</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/webkit-vs-chromium-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-837211" /><br/>
This rule introduces a considerable barrier for developers outside the EU, who are now limited to using simulators instead of actual devices for testing their browsers. This restriction complicates the process of developing and supporting browsers with alternative engines, as on-device testing is essential to accurate performance assessment and troubleshooting. Apple's previous policy, which remains in place in other regions around the world, demands the use of WebKit for all iOS and iPadOS browsers, effectively making every browser on these platforms a variant of Safari. <br/>
<br/>
Under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple was designated as a gatekeeper in the European Union, compelling the company to make changes to its policies. With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/apple-releases-ios-17-4/">release of iOS 17.4</a>, Apple began allowing the use of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-eu-ios-17-4/">alternative browser engines within the EU</a>. However, it has now emerged that testing of browsers with third-party engines is strictly geofenced to the EU, potentially hindering the ability of developers around the world to address security issues or implement updates efficiently.<br/>
<br/>
The requirements raise some practical concerns about the feasibility of supporting a separate EU browser. Some developers have pointed out that Apple's extensive list of conditions makes it challenging to comply while also ensuring that the browser remains competitive and secure. <br/>
<br/>
The European Commission has launched an investigation into Apple's compliance with the DMA, focusing on the restrictive nature of its latest changes. The investigation seeks to determine whether Apple's requirements are designed to circumvent the spirit of the DMA by making it difficult for competitors to operate on a level playing field.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/third-party-browser-engine-testing-geofenced-to-eu/">Testing of iOS Browsers With Third-Party Engines Geofenced to EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-of-ios-browsers-with-third-party-engines-geofenced-to-eu.2426663/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some new M4 iPad Pro models are exhibiting a visible static grain pattern across the OLED display, according to several user reports on Reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1csrchw/grainy_display_on_ipad_m4/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1csvetg/anybody_else_have_extremely_noticeable_grain_on/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1cto5kp/another_grain_data_point/">3</a>) and the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/grainy-display-on-new-ipad-pro-m4.2426450/"><em>MacRumors</em> Forums</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/oled-m4-ipad-pro-grainy-display-reports.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951250" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/grainy-display-on-new-ipad-pro-m4.2426450/page-3">MacRumors user bk215</a></em></div><br/>
Users who see the grain generally report that it is most noticeable in dark environments with the display set at a low to medium brightness while viewing content with gray or muted colors. Some have compared the effect to a photo taken on a high ISO setting that has visual noise.<br/>
<br/>
Whether this is a genuine display defect is hard to say at this point. OLED displays in general can exhibit a visual grain or a "screen-door effect" due to several factors related to the design and manufacturing process.<br/>
<br/>
The individual sub-pixels in OLED displays can vary in size and shape, contributing to an inconsistent, uneven texture or graininess. This is usually more noticeable on larger displays. Variations in the deposition of organic materials can also affect the uniformity of light emission.<br/>
<br/>
OLED displays also control brightness at the pixel level, and power management techniques can lead to minor variations in brightness across the screen. This is sometimes noticeable as a grainy effect, particularly in low-light conditions or when displaying uniform colors.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, there were similar reports of <a href="https://x.com/lafaiel/status/1761014092582777205">grainy screens on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra smartphones</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Samsung supplies the displays for Apple's 11-inch M4 iPad Pro model, while LG Display supplies the panels for the 13-inch model. According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/ipad-pro-delay-poor-oled-panel-yields/">March report</a> out of Korea, Samsung faced poor yields of the 11-inch panels, and was unable to meet Apple's order quantity. The shortfall led Apple to transfer some orders for the smaller panel to LG Display. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/grain-effect-oled-ipad-pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1080" height="712" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951255" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1csvetg/anybody_else_have_extremely_noticeable_grain_on/">Reddit user Vingdoloras</a></em></div><br/>
So far most reports relate to the 11-inch iPad Pro, but there are one or two that reference the 13-inch model, so it is unclear if the potential defect – if it is indeed one – is specific to one OLED panel supplier. The reports appear to be limited to new iPad Pro models with the Standard glass option. Apple's latest iPad Pro models are also available with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/ipad-pro-nano-texture-glass/">matte nano-texture display option</a> for 1TB and 2TB storage configurations at an additional cost of &#36;100. <br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in the iPhone 16 Pro Max will use battery cells with increased energy density, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, which will offer either longer battery life using the same battery size as that found in existing models, or equivalent battery life using a smaller battery.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-battery-kosutami.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923492" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/%E4%BF%A1%E7%B6%AD%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%E7%82%BA%E6%96%B0%E6%AC%BEiphone-16-pro-max%E7%9A%84%E9%9B%BB%E6%B1%A0%E8%83%BD%E9%87%8F%E5%AF%86%E5%BA%A6%E5%8D%87%E7%B4%9A%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%BB%E8%A6%81%E5%8F%97%E7%9B%8A%E8%80%85-sunway-is-a-major-beneficiary-of-the-new-iphone-16-pro-9df9c5cd3913">latest supply chain survey</a>, Kuo says the energy density (Wh/kg) of the battery cells in the iPhone 16 Pro Max will increase, which "has the benefit of longer battery life with the same battery size or lower battery size with the same battery life."<br/>
<br/>
To avoid overheating the battery, Apple is using a stainless steel battery case for the first time as a thermal solution, according to Kuo.<br/>
<blockquote>Stainless steel is not as effective as aluminum in dissipating heat, but it is more robust and less susceptible to corrosion. The use of a stainless steel battery case also reduces the difficulty of removing the battery, which will help Apple comply with the European Union's requirements for mobile phone batteries' replaceability in the future.</blockquote>Sunway will reportedly be a major supplier of the stainless steel battery cases. If the mass production of this new battery design goes well, Kuo believes the design will be adopted across all iPhone 17 models next year.<br/>
<br/>
A rumor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/iphone-15-could-feature-stacked-battery-technology/">last June</a> suggested that the iPhone 16 Pro models will use stacked batteries, which can result in higher capacity and a longer lifespan, but Kuo makes no mention of the technology in his survey. Apple is expected to release the upcoming iPhone 16 lineup in four months, likely around mid-September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/iphone-16-pro-max-longer-battery-life/">Kuo: iPhone 16 Pro Max Could Feature Longer Battery Life</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-16-pro-max-could-feature-longer-battery-life.2426640/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/newsroom/2024/05/apple-introduces-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-in-japan/">announced</a> Tap to Pay on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in Japan, allowing independent sellers, small merchants, and large retailers in the country to use ‌iPhones‌ as a payment terminal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-Tap-to-Pay-Japan-iPhone-iOS-app-digital-wallets.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951227" /><br/>
Tap to Pay first arrived in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/08/apple-announces-tap-to-pay-iphone-feature/">February 2022</a> in the US, and allows iPhones to accept payments via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets‌‌‌.  All transactions are encrypted, and Apple has no information about what is purchased or the person who made the purchase.<br/>
<br/>
No additional hardware or credit card machine is required‌ to use Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The feature uses NFC technology to securely authenticate the contactless payments, plus the feature also supports PIN entry, which includes accessibility options.<br/>
<blockquote>"In Japan, a country where innovation and tradition merge, new payment methods have been introduced all over the country, and at the same time, the transition from cash payment to electronic payment is progressing rapidly on the consumer side," said Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. "We are very pleased that through our new partnership with the payment platform, we can provide iPhone touch payment that can seamlessly support contactless payments for millions of businesses. This allows almost all iPhones in the country to be used as payment terminals without additional hardware, reducing the cost of responding to electronic payments by Japanese businesses, making it easy and secure for customers, and protecting their privacy. It will be possible to provide a contactless payment experience."</blockquote>GMO Financial Gate's stera tap app, Recruit's Air Pay Touch app, and Square's Square POS register app will be the first payment platforms in Japan to offer touch payment with &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to businesses, according to Apple. Additionally, Adyen will support it in the coming months, and it will also be available at Apple Stores in Japan. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s touch payment supports contactless credit and debit cards from the four major payment networks: American Express, JCB, Mastercard, and Visa.<br/>
<br/>
Tap to Pay on ‌‌‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌‌‌ requires ‌‌‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌‌‌ XS or newer models, and works for customers as any normal ‌‌‌‌&zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;‌‌‌‌ transaction would. Sellers just need to open up the app, register the sale, and present their ‌‌‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌‌‌ to the buyer, who can then use an appropriate contactless payment method.<br/>
<br/>
Japan becomes the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tap-to-pay/regions/">ninth region</a> to support Tap to Pay, following similar rollouts in the U.K., Australia, Taiwan, Brazil, Ukraine, France, and the Netherlands last year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/japan/">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/apple-launches-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-in-japan/">Apple Launches Tap to Pay on iPhone in Japan</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-in-japan.2426638/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Threads is working on a new web view that features the option to pin customized columns, similar to the TweetDeck feature that used to be available on Twitter. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C7CQT2rLTeN">shared an image</a> of the new web option, which he said is currently being tested.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/threads-multi-column-view-web.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951162" /><br/>
The screenshot shows several custom columns, including a "For you" and several topic-based columns. Favorite searches, topics/keywords, accounts, saved posts, and notifications can be pinned at the current time, and there is an auto-refresh option to keep columns up to date with the newest posts.<br/>
<br/>
Twitter, now renamed to X, has a similar "X Pro" feature that has the same format as the former TweetDeck option, but it requires an &#36;8/month subscription to access. The Threads version would be free, and it could replicate much of the functionality that Twitter used to offer.<br/>
<br/>
A column-based web view that's customizable could encourage more users to adopt Threads, and it prevents Threads users from being forced into the For you feed when opening Threads on the web. According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-16/threads-meta-s-x-competitor-is-testing-its-own-version-of-tweetdeck?srnd=infotech">Bloomberg</a></em>, Threads users that have the feature can pin up to 100 feeds to their homepage.<br/>
<br/>
As of now, the multi-column view is being tested with a small number of users.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Threads also <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C6_8zLPvaFA">added a new option</a> to organize searches by recency, making it easier to find timely and relevant content on the social network.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/">Threads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/16/threads-tweetdeck-web-view/">Threads Gets Multi-Column TweetDeck-Like Web View</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-gets-multi-column-tweetdeck-like-web-view.2426602/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
